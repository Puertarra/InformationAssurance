Jamming covert timing channel is a main method to restrict the channel's capacity, but existing works' jamming strategies don't take the packets arriving rate and queue's length into account, the jamming strategies they use may affect the overt channel's availability. This paper proposes a self adaptive jamming strategy which can adjust the service time according to the packets' arriving rate and the queue's length. The experiment result shows that the new strategy can effectively restrict the covert timing channel and keep the availability of the overt channel. \\u00a9 2011 IEEE.\",\n          \"This study investigates the relationships among information security awareness, concern for information privacy, consumer alienation, privacy risk belief, lurking, and self-concealment. It explores the mediation effects of concern for information privacy/consumer alienation between information security awareness and privacy risk belief as well as the mediation effect of lurking between privacy risk belief and self-concealment. The results confirm that information security awareness has significant and positive effects on concern for information privacy, consumer alienation, and privacy risk belief. Concerns for information privacy and consumer alienation have significant and positive effects on privacy risk belief. Privacy risk belief has a significant and positive effect on lurking and self-concealment. Lurking has a significant and positive effect on self-concealment. Concerns for information privacy and consumer alienation are mediators between information security awareness and privacy risk belief. In addition, perceived privacy empowerment is a moderator between privacy risk belief and lurking as well as between privacy risk belief and self-concealment. \\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd\",\n          \"The 2021 T-Mobile breach conducted by John Erin Binns resulted in the theft of 54 million customers' personal data. The attacker gained entry into T-Mobile's systems through an unprotected router and used brute force techniques to access the sensitive information stored on the internal servers. The data stolen included names, addresses, Social Security Numbers, birthdays, driver's license numbers, ID information, IMEIs, and IMSIs. We analyze the data breach and how it opens the door to identity theft and many other forms of hacking such as SIM Hijacking. SIM Hijacking is a form of hacking in which bad actors can take control of a victim's phone number allowing them means to bypass additional safety measures currently in place to prevent fraud. This paper thoroughly reviews the attack methodology, impact, and attempts to provide an understanding of important measures and possible defense solutions against future attacks. We also detail other social engineering attacks that can be incurred from releasing the leaked data. copy; 2022 IEEE. \\u00a9 2022 IEEE.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"covert channel; covert timing channel; information security; multi-level security\",\n          \"Concern for information privacy; Consumer alienation; Information security awareness; Lurking; Privacy risk belief; Self-concealment\",\n          \"Brute Force; Cyber Attack; Identity Theft; Scanning and Enumeration; SIM Hijacking; SSH tunneling; T-Mobile\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Index Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Data processing; Security of data; Channel's capacity; Covert channels; Covert timing channels; Jamming strategies; Multi-level security; New strategy; Self-adaptive; Service time; Jamming\",\n          \"Security of data; Consumer alienation; Information privacy; Information security awareness; Lurking; Privacy risks; Self-concealment; alienation; awareness; consumer; empowerment; human; mediator; privacy; social network; Consumer behavior\",\n          \"Data visualization; Engineering education; Learning systems; Network security; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Social networking (online); Visualization; Collaborative e-Learning; Collaborative relationships; Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; Multi-disciplinary approach; On-line assessment; Peer to peer; Public key infrastructure; Trustworthiness; E-learning\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Document Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Article\",\n          \"Conference paper\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Scopus\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":44}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Find rows in the \"Abstract\" column that contain the expression \"[No abstract available]\"\n","dataset[dataset[\"Abstract\"].str.contains(r\"No abstract\")]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"m2o8WQdbQrLc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713140388125,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":369,"user":{"displayName":"Andres Leiva","userId":"13924510545082436192"}},"outputId":"428a191d-8b01-4979-d410-c1b2b7b38e7d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                 Authors  \\\n","9                                              Horn E.C.   \n","17                                              Paans R.   \n","24      Diffie W.; Simmons G.J.; Chaum D.; Jueneman R.R.   \n","33                                          King Dave W.   \n","41                                          Gifford E.A.   \n","...                                                  ...   \n","10073                                                NaN   \n","10110  Pandey A.; Borah S.; Chaudhary B.; Rana S.; Si...   \n","10258                                       Bohannanr R.   \n","10340                        Rinza B.E.S.; Cortes S.A.E.   \n","10488                                           Cheng M.   \n","\n","                                       Author full names  \\\n","9                            Horn, Earl C.

Accordingly, this poses the problem of revising the basic concepts of information-measuring systems building, developing software and hardware for the implementation of the target management process. This requires development of new approaches to presentation, processing, and display of data about the aggregates state of energy-active objects and the entire information structure. For management under threat conditions, it is necessary to take into account the features of the information infrastructure, data selection and processing methods, methods and algorithms for classifying the situation, which are formed from blocks of data obtained from each unit and the technological process as a whole. Information about the current state of system and infrastructure is necessary for the formation, adoption and implementation of management decisions which is the basis for coordination strategies synthesis. Appropriate target orientation, reasonable indicators of real process trajectories divergence from the target state determine the probability of object attack. Knowledge and decision-making procedures for the coordination of managerial actions is based on the strategic target orientation of the structure, their professionalism and the level of intellectual, cognitive and scientific training which is the basis for correct situation interpretation of countermeasures against threats formation. In the event of active threats complex on man-made systems in a certain region (resource, cognitive, system, information) and natural disasters or military operations, the threats lead to active destruction or failure of the production process. In order to functionally withstand related production structures, when loyal to the industrial relations concept, they need to integrate at the strategic management level on common goal basis to reduce risks. If necessary, to increase sustainability, they can be integrated at operational management level using interconnections at the production and resource levels. To do this, it is necessary to develop a strategic and goaloriented management system behaviour line, which requires informational and intelligent data processing at the highest level using cognitive creative methods. For each level of the infrastructure hierarchy, oriented towards strategic goals in the global infrastructure dynamic environment, methods of assessing the situation to detect failures and the actions of attacks have been developed, based on which countermeasures are formed depending on the type of threats. \\u00a9 2023 River Publishers.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"digital transformation of society;

This applies to ensuring that business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) plans are documented and executable as per the business continuity strategy and that the capabilities are deployed as part of an overall business continuity program for the enterprise. Testing BC/DR plans is done with regard to justifying the economic benefit of having BC/DR capabilities in place. A company that decides not to test its BC/DR plans will not know if those capabilities and documented procedures will work during a disaster and thus jeopardize survivability of the enterprise. The information security professional may be asked to assume the role of testing coordinator or facilitator. This role, in most organizations, is responsible for coordinating and facilitating testing of all BC/DR plans, which requires a thorough understanding of the plans to ensure that the business continuity policy will be met, attaining appropriate funding for the overall testing of these plans, identifying the types of testing that should be conducted, scheduling testing to minimize its impact on business operations, and developing scenario-based test plans that clearly state the scope, purpose, and objective for testing. \\u00a9 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\",\n          \"[Toapanta Toapanta S.M., 2019]: The security problems in the Armed Forces of Ecuador were analyzed, the security parameters were checked to protect the military information of the Armed Forces of Ecuador database, using the security of the information.

In recent years, some researchers began to utilize low-level hardware micro-architecture features to detect malware, because these micro-architecture features are difficult for malware evasion. However, these methods always adopt a long sample length and can hardly identify non-signature malware. This situation will inevitably affect the detection efficiency and effectiveness. To solve the above problems, we first select system call instruction as a trigger point to extract low-level features for avoiding blindly collecting unrelated data continuously. Specifically, we use the General-Purpose Registers (GPRs) as features for malware detection. Each register has specific functions and changes of its content contain the action information which thus can be used to detect illegal behaviours. To improve detection efficiency, we then propose a resampling method to well present the spatial and temporal properties of GPRs. Finally, a novel deep learning model is designed to highlight correlations among GPRs for accurate malware detection. Experimental results achieved 99% of Accuracy and zero False Positive rate (FPr) using only a short sample length and can also identify non-signature malware. \\u00a9 2019 IEEE.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## __Summarizations__\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fcfoW-hW7ZgZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### __Analysis decade 1990 - 1999__"],"metadata":{"id":"jHOpIXVmmpD_"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"IvvOjfrIk8PN"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Concatenate the Paper_id with the Abstract\n","abstracts = df_abstract[df_abstract['Year'].between(1990, 1999)]['abstract'].rename('abstract')\n","titles = dataset[\"Title\"]"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["abstracts"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5UCXXV04cNed","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713449134230,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":120,"user":{"displayName":"Andres Leiva","userId":"13924510545082436192"}},"outputId":"eb5cad2b-64be-42a2-ae22-052612f4fa89"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["51     [Zheng Y., 1990]: One of the ultimate goals of...\n","90     [Demaio H.B., 1993]: It's not uncommon when se...\n","91     [Vetter Linda L., 1990]: While the automation ...\n","92     [Xu M., 1992]: Based on separation of the sum ...\n","93     [Fried L., 1993]: Preserving information secur...\n","                             ...                        \n","477    [Johnston Jim, 1999]: Managing and securing in...\n","479    [Liu C., 1999]: Certificate management systems...\n","480    [Liu Y., 1999]: The article is to make some re...\n","481    [Chappell Brett L., 1999]: Information securit...\n","482    [Schoua C., 1999]: The National Colloquium for...\n","Name: abstract, Length: 379, dtype: object"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":48}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# remove the tags <b> and <i> from abstracts\n","\n","import re\n","abstracts = abstracts.apply(lambda x: re.sub(r'<b>|<\\/b>|<i>|<\\/i>', '', x))\n","abstracts.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n","abstracts"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"m5mfQSxpfTjO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713449136724,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":146,"user":{"displayName":"Andres Leiva","userId":"13924510545082436192"}},"outputId":"f694bd1a-457e-4347-9263-c39bd4edc786"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0      [Zheng Y., 1990]: One of the ultimate goals of...\n","1      [Demaio H.B., 1993]: It's not uncommon when se...\n","2      [Vetter Linda L., 1990]: While the automation ...\n","3      [Xu M., 1992]: Based on separation of the sum ...\n","4      [Fried L., 1993]: Preserving information secur...\n","                             ...                        \n","374    [Johnston Jim, 1999]: Managing and securing in...\n","375    [Liu C., 1999]: Certificate management systems...\n","376    [Liu Y., 1999]: The article is to make some re...\n","377    [Chappell Brett L., 1999]: Information securit...\n","378    [Schoua C., 1999]: The National Colloquium for...\n","Name: abstract, Length: 379, dtype: object"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":49}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["abstracts.iloc[3]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":86},"id":"sEAVjmhY6ANv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713449139153,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Andres Leiva","userId":"13924510545082436192"}},"outputId":"934aa0a9-140b-4f3b-8cf3-7f933d72f095"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'[Xu M., 1992]: Based on separation of the sum of chaotic signals, this paper proposes a novel spread spectrum modulation scheme‚Äîinitial condition modulation (ICM), which is suitable for high data rate communications.

[Erman Timothy, 1995]: Achieving\n","network security requires more than simply selecting a system that utilizes good encryption\n","algorithm.

However, the most robust of encryption algorithms is of\n","no value without proper system implementation and user security awareness. Any security system will\n","be attacked at its weakest point.

This kind of semantics can be used as a helpful retrofit for the proposals for a\n","‚Äúmultilevel secure‚Äù database model 1994, and may be useful for less restrictive security policies as\n","well. We also propose a family of query languages for multilevel secure relational database\n","applications, and base the semantics of those languages on our semantics for secure databases.

While this is recognized by supporters of all security models, it is the\n","key concept on which the filter model is founded, thus setting this model apart from other common\n","models. The filter model proposed in this paper goes further to include two levels of effectiveness,\n","and uses a matrix presentation to summarize predicted effectiveness. The model as presented in this\n","paper is at a high level of generality, with only five categories of security action and seven\n","categories of threat being considered.

Caregivers\n","are expected to respect the confidential nature of patient information. Yet quality management\n","programs, for example, entail systematic, efficient collection of information extracted from patient\n","case files. Compiling \"report cards\" on managed care networks necessitates access to aggregated\n","information on episodes of care and their outcomes. Regional provider networks; the development of\n","comprehensive computerized patient records; and the dependence of health care reform on large-scale,\n","highly distributed databases make the patient record even more vulnerable. Each organization must\n","assess whether its protection of patients' privacy is sufficient. AN INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM: A\n","logical first step in devising such a program is to establish the necessary policies, which are\n","prerequisites to the proper development of computer systems.

[Katsikas S., 1996]: High Level\n","Security Policies (HLSPs) are management instructions indicating how an organisation is to be run.\n","They are the primary building blocks for any information security effort. In order to successfully\n","install security in Information Systems operating in European Health Care Establishments (HCEs), a\n","set of principles and guidelines must exist, which establishes both direction and management\n","support. A HLSP should be used as a reference for a wide variety of information security and privacy\n","activities which include establishment of user access privileges, performing risk analyses,\n","conducting investigation of security and privacy threats, etc. It should also be considered as an\n","essential part of the overall information policy of every HCE, which helps integrating the\n","procedural aspects within the administrative organisation in the HCE. A HLSP refers primarily to two\n","main actors, namely the acting subjects (patients, physicians, health informaticians,\n","administrators, health care authorities, insurance companies, etc.) and the data objects that should\n","be protected (medical records, communication data, etc.). The High Level Security Policy proposed\n","herein should be fully adopted in order to be effective; moreover, conformance to its provisions\n","should be made mandatory for all members of staff; special approval should be required when a HCE\n","staff member wishes to take a course of action divergent from policy rules. It is worth noticing\n","that even when a High Level Security Policy already exists, it is advisable to the management of the\n","Health Care Establishment to periodically revisit it to see whether it should be modified or\n","augmented. Security in Health Care Automated Information Systems can be conceptually viewed at four\n","distinct levels of abstraction, namely generic principles (society and culture dependent);\n","principles (administration dependent); guidelines (technology dependent) and measures (installation\n","dependent). HLSPs address the two middle levels of abstraction, namely principles and guidelines.\n","Hence, HLSPs depend on generic principles and must be complemented by measures. The HLSP, as it\n","stands, defines the general approach that a Health Care Establishment should have towards\n","implementing security. In other words, it states what should be done in order to implement security\n","efficiently; it does not provide technical details on how to do this. These details can be found in\n","the specialised technical guidelines developed within SEISMED. No formalised security levels have\n","been considered in this document. Rather, the High Level Security Policy herein provides a set of\n","mandatory conditions to ensure adequate security of personal information processed by Health\n","Information Systems. The HLSP proposed herein was developed by a top-down approach. Specifically,\n","principles were first derived as a result of: ‚àö consulting, analysing and adapting relevant similar\n","efforts of international bodies, including - inter alia - the CEC (Directives 287 and 288), the\n","Council of Europe, the Organisation of Economical Co-operation and Development (OECD), the US\n","Department of Health Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook, etc. ‚àö considering\n","what the functional model of a 'secure' HCE should be. Secondly, guidelines were developed, by\n","detailing principles. The end result is a set of nine principles and eighty seven guidelines. The\n","HLSP was developed in three phases. The first phase aimed at providing the reference centres with an\n","initial draft of the HLSP, based on: ‚àö the results of an attitude survey among Health Care\n","professionals in Europe; ‚àö the results of Risk Analysis exercises conducted at the four hospitals\n","acting as reference centres; ‚àö the results of the analysis of existing and emerging data protection\n","legislation throughout Europe; ‚àö relevant international literature. The second phase consisted of\n","the evaluation of the draft HLSP produced by the first phase by Health Care professionals, Health\n","Informaticians and management. The third phase consisted of the evaluation of the draft HLSP by all\n","SEISMED partners and resulted in the current document. The end result is a compromise between\n","several different (but mostly fundamentally convergent) opinions expressed by project participants\n","or external experts; nevertheless it is felt that this has not led into major internal\n","inconsistencies or contradictions. It is also felt that the HLSP should undergo a further, lengthy\n","period of implementation in several HCEs across Europe, so it can be verified, amended, or modified\n","according to everyday practice. ¬© 1996 The Authors.

This document\n","presents guidelines for the security of existing European health care systems based upon work\n","conducted by SEISMED workpackage SP07 (Security in Existing Systems). Information technology has had\n","a significant impact upon Health care Establishments (HCEs) in Europe, with information systems now\n","affecting most aspects of their operation. As a result, health care professionals are becoming\n","increasingly dependent upon the availability and the correctness of systems and data. Unfortunately,\n","many existing systems current operate without security having been properly addressed, making them\n","vulnerable to a variety of accidental and deliberate threats. As a result there is a requirement to\n","add or enhance protection in many cases. In many ways the security requirements in health care\n","environments are fundamentally different from other domains and hence many aspects of existing\n","standards were considered inappropriate. The problem has been addressed by the development of\n","information security guidelines specifically targeting the health care community. A comprehensive\n","set of baseline security recommendations have been developed for use by all HCEs within Europe,\n","representing a minimal acceptable standard for the security of operational health information\n","systems and their associated environments. The guidelines are intended to provide a straightforward\n","means of identifying security weaknesses and validating existing systems to ensure compliance. The\n","guidelines were developed in close consultation with the medical community, with input from both the\n","SEISMED Reference Centres and other independent health care professionals. The guidelines are\n","grouped under ten key principles of protection, which are considered to represent the main areas\n","that must be considered in securing existing systems. Coverage includes policy and administration\n","issues, physical and environmental protection, personnel security procedures and logical I system\n","security controls. The guidelines are relevant to and will affect all categories of HCE personnel.\n","However, certain issues are not appropriate to all staff and, therefore, three separate sets of\n","guidelines are available, each focusing on different classes of HCE personnel. ‚Ä¢ General guidelines\n","are available for day-to-day reference by the majority of HCE staff (including clinicians,\n","administrators and general system users). ‚Ä¢ Management guidelines target those responsible for\n","determining HCE security policy and also serve to explain the need for a number of more technically\n","based measures. ‚Ä¢ IT & Security Personnel guidelines present the most detailed information relating\n","to the implementation and validation of security and address personnel such as IT staff and system\n","administrators. These documents provide extensive information on what aspects of security should be\n","considered, with appropriate guidelines in each case, as well as general suggestions on\n","implementation. It is envisaged that the guidelines may be used as either a detailed source of\n","reference during the introduction of security or, alternatively, as a simple means of validating\n","existing arrangements. ¬© 1996 The Authors.  [McKnight L., 1996]: A flurry of events in 1995\n","demonstrated that issues related to electronic commerce and information security are of deep concern\n","to the public, businesses, government, researchers, and users of the rapidly expanding Internet. The\n","sometimes heated and wide ranging debate concerning cryptographic policy, content controls,\n","commerce, and interoperability on the Internet tends to divert attention away from the need for a\n","reasoned assessment and understanding of the true dynamics of nurturing a diverse global marketplace\n","on the Internet. Lost in the contentious debate is a principle we feel is particularly important\n","given the nature of information technology: that a policy consistent with user requirements and\n","market acceptance provides economic benefits. In some cases, the 'economic pie' can be expanded-or\n","shrunk-by corporate or government actions, inevitably affecting all. We argue that information\n","security is compromised if federal policies and corporate initiatives ignore user requirements and\n","the basic principles of Internet economics. This in turn may limit market acceptance of new\n","research, services, applications, and technologies. For example, unintended results from ill-formed\n","federal laws may severely limit economic benefits gained from billions of dollars of federally\n","sponsored research that created and sustained the Internet. Furthermore, in the guise of enhanced\n","security and advanced features, proprietary systems and partitioned markets lead to a lack of\n","interoperability that further compromises prospects for society to realize the aforementioned\n","benefits. Many of these problems can be avoided by an open policymaking process that is informed by\n","collaborative research and development activities. It would be ironic indeed if the set of federal\n","policies that founded and sustained the precursors of the evolving electronic marketplace centered\n","on the Internet forced those new opportunities offshore.

In that sense, a\n","cryptographic algorithm or protocol is simply a mechanism to transfer trust from where it exists to\n","where it is needed. This paper puts the focus on trust itself and shows that it is a very complex\n","concept with many interesting and important implications. We do not attempt to define a formal trust\n","model, but rather examine the types of trust and trust relationships which are relevant for\n","information security. It is shown that the existence of trust as a phenomenon depends on the\n","existence of malicious behaviour. This observation leads to the distinction between passionate\n","entities with human-like capabilities, and rational entities which basically are systems. Trust can\n","then be defined as the belief that a rational entity will resist malicious manipulation or that a\n","passionate entity will behave without malicious intent. It is also shown that trust relationships\n","exhibit a great diversity, that they are based on knowledge and that they contain aspects in common\n","with strategy games.  [Kanto J., 1996]: The nature of preoperative anxiety appears to vary from\n","patient to patient, and the natural course of the condition has not been well evaluated. In clinical\n","studies, the incidence of preoperative anxiety has varied widely, from 11 to 80%, depending on the\n","methods used to assess it. Because there appears to be a relationship between high preoperative\n","level of anxiety and greater surgical risk, attempts to measure and relieve presurgical anxiety seem\n","to be of clinical significance. There are several problems with the designs and methods used in past\n","and more recent studies of premedication. Many of the recent results were produced from studies that\n","used a variety of more or less validated assessments, yielding variable results in different centres\n","which can seldom be compared with each other. More accurate and generally accepted but simple\n","assessments are needed to study the anxiolytic effect of different premedicants. Benzodiazepines are\n","the most popular preoperative agents because their anxiolytic effect is associated with high patient\n","acceptance and they are devoid of significant adverse effects. However, great interindividual\n","variation in response does occur. It is likely that new methods of administering benzodiazepines\n","(such as by intranasal, transmucosal and rectal routes) could increase the utility of these agents.\n","The preoperative anxiolytic effect of antipsychotics, antihistamines and barbiturates is\n","questionable, but some opioids and especially Œ±2 receptor agonists appear to have this property.\n","However, clinically significant unwanted effects may prevent the routine use of the latter 2 drug\n","groups. It should be noted that all patients do not automatically require pharmacological\n","premedication. Good preoperative information, assurance and a positive attitude of hospital\n","personnel may be the best treatment for preoperative anxiety in some cases.

[Katsikas S., 1996]: High Level Security\n","Policies (HLSPs) are management instructions indicating how an organisation is to be run. They are\n","the primary building blocks for any information security effort. In order to successfully install\n","security in Information Systems operating in European Health Care Establishments (HCEs), a set of\n","principles and guidelines must exist, which establishes both direction and management support. A\n","HLSP should be used as a reference for a wide variety of information security and privacy activities\n","which include establishment of user access privileges, performing risk analyses, conducting\n","investigation of security and privacy threats, etc. It should also be considered as an essential\n","part of the overall information policy of every HCE, which helps integrating the procedural aspects\n","within the administrative organisation in the HCE. A HLSP refers primarily to two main actors,\n","namely the acting subjects (patients, physicians, health informaticians, administrators, health care\n","authorities, insurance companies, etc.) and the data objects that should be protected (medical\n","records, communication data, etc.). The High Level Security Policy proposed herein should be fully\n","adopted in order to be effective; moreover, conformance to its provisions should be made mandatory\n","for all members of staff; special approval should be required when a HCE staff member wishes to take\n","a course of action divergent from policy rules. It is worth noticing that even when a High Level\n","Security Policy already exists, it is advisable to the management of the Health Care Establishment\n","to periodically revisit it to see whether it should be modified or augmented. Security in Health\n","Care Automated Information Systems can be conceptually viewed at four distinct levels of\n","abstraction, namely generic principles (society and culture dependent); principles (administration\n","dependent); guidelines (technology dependent) and measures (installation dependent). HLSPs address\n","the two middle levels of abstraction, namely principles and guidelines. Hence, HLSPs depend on\n","generic principles and must be complemented by measures. The HLSP, as it stands, defines the general\n","approach that a Health Care Establishment should have towards implementing security. In other words,\n","it states what should be done in order to implement security efficiently; it does not provide\n","technical details on how to do this. These details can be found in the specialised technical\n","guidelines developed within SEISMED. No formalised security levels have been considered in this\n","document. Rather, the High Level Security Policy herein provides a set of mandatory conditions to\n","ensure adequate security of personal information processed by Health Information Systems. The HLSP\n","proposed herein was developed by a top-down approach. Specifically, principles were first derived as\n","a result of consulting, analysing and adapting relevant similar efforts of international bodies,\n","including - inter alia - the CEC (Directives 287 and 288), the Council of Europe, the Organisation\n","of Economical Co-operation and Development (OECD), the US Department of Health Automated Information\n","Systems Security Program Handbook, etc. considering what the functional model of a 'secure' HCE\n","should be. Secondly, guidelines were developed, by detailing principles. The end result is a set of\n","nine principles and eighty seven guidelines. The HLSP was developed in three phases. The first phase\n","aimed at providing the reference centres with an initial draft of the HLSP, based on the results of\n","an attitude survey among Health Care professionals in Europe the results of Risk Analysis exercises\n","conducted at the four hospitals acting as reference centres the results of the analysis of existing\n","and emerging data protection legislation throughout Europe relevant international literature. The\n","second phase consisted of the evaluation of the draft HLSP produced by the first phase by Health\n","Care professionals, Health Informaticians and management. The third phase consisted of the\n","evaluation of the draft HLSP by all SEISMED partners and resulted in the current document. The end\n","result is a compromise between several different (but mostly fundamentally convergent) opinions\n","expressed by project participants or external experts; nevertheless it is felt that this has not led\n","into major internal inconsistencies or contradictions. It is also felt that the HLSP should undergo\n","a further, lengthy period of implementation in several HCEs across Europe, so it can be verified,\n","amended, or modified according to everyday practice.

Here, we\n","point at some problems it poses and suggest solutions. The basic problem considered involves the\n","design of a mobile agent that is capable of traversing an untrusted (curious) network while\n","gathering and securing data from the nodes that it visits. We assume that some subset of the nodes\n","may collaborate to track the agent, and we assume that snapshots of memory are taken at each node at\n","times that are unpredictable to the agent. The data that is gathered must be securely stored within\n","the agent and the adversarial nodes must remain oblivious to what is taken by the agent. In\n","addition, the agent‚Äôs movement throughout the network should be made difficult to trace.\n","Furthermore, we assume that the agent is limited in storage capacity. To prevent the nodes from\n","getting decryption capability, the agent must carry a public key for (asymmetric) encryption.

This is a new mode of operation of\n","public key cryptosystems that allows the encryption of small amounts of plaintext yielding small\n","amounts of ciphertext. Furthermore, the encryption is performed so that it is intractable to recover\n","the plaintext without the appropriate private key. We also describe how to modify sliding encryption\n","so that the resulting ciphertexts are hard to correlate, thus making it possible to have mobile\n","agents that are not easy to trace. Sliding encryption is applicable to mobile agent technology and\n","may have independent applications to ‚Äústorage-limited technology‚âì such as smartcards and mobile\n","units. ¬© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.

Documents are, by definition, mostly used as vehicles for the\n","exchange of information not only within, but also between and among organizations. Important\n","fundamentals on which this paper is based are as follows: the security requirements of specific\n","categories of documents, the various processing stages of documents, such as draft and final, and\n","the contents and structure of documents. In addition, the concept of information capability will be\n","introduced. (The term \"information capability\" imports the \"amount\" of information added to the data\n","already contained in a document by means of the structural properties of that document.) The model\n","that will be devised on the strength of this paper will promote the consistent classification of\n","documents and is intended for integration with commercial software products that command document\n","processing capabilities, for example, document management systems and groupware.

In order to successfully\n","install security in Information Systems operating in European Health Care Establishments (HCEs), a\n","set of principles and guidelines must exist, which establishes both direction and management\n","support. A HLSP should be used as a reference for a wide variety of information security and privacy\n","activities which include establishment of user access privileges, performing risk analyses,\n","conducting investigation of security and privacy threats, etc. It should also be considered as an\n","essential part of the overall information policy of every HCE, which helps integrating the\n","procedural aspects within the administrative organisation in the HCE. A HLSP refers primarily to two\n","main actors, namely the acting subjects (patients, physicians, health informaticians,\n","administrators, health care authorities, insurance companies, etc.) and the data objects that should\n","be protected (medical records, communication data, etc.). The High Level Security Policy proposed\n","herein should be fully adopted in order to be effective; moreover, conformance to its provisions\n","should be made mandatory for all members of staff; special approval should be required when a HCE\n","staff member wishes to take a course of action divergent from policy rules. It is worth noticing\n","that even when a High Level Security Policy already exists, it is advisable to the management of the\n","Health Care Establishment to periodically revisit it to see whether it should be modified or\n","augmented. Security in Health Care Automated Information Systems can be conceptually viewed at four\n","distinct levels of abstraction, namely generic principles (society and culture dependent);\n","principles (administration dependent); guidelines (technology dependent) and measures (installation\n","dependent). HLSPs address the two middle levels of abstraction, namely principles and guidelines.\n","Hence, HLSPs depend on generic principles and must be complemented by measures. The HLSP, as it\n","stands, defines the general approach that a Health Care Establishment should have towards\n","implementing security. In other words, it states what should be done in order to implement security\n","efficiently; it does not provide technical details on how to do this. These details can be found in\n","the specialised technical guidelines developed within SEISMED. No formalised security levels have\n","been considered in this document. Rather, the High Level Security Policy herein provides a set of\n","mandatory conditions to ensure adequate security of personal information processed by Health\n","Information Systems. The HLSP proposed herein was developed by a top-down approach. Specifically,\n","principles were first derived as a result of: ‚àö consulting, analysing and adapting relevant similar\n","efforts of international bodies, including - inter alia - the CEC (Directives 287 and 288), the\n","Council of Europe, the Organisation of Economical Co-operation and Development (DECD), the US\n","Department of Health Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook, etc. ‚àö considering\n","what the functional model of a 'secure' HCE should be. Secondly, guidelines were developed, by\n","detailing principles. The end result is a set of nine principles and eighty seven guidelines. The\n","HLSP was developed in three phases. The first phase aimed at providing the reference centres with an\n","initial draft of the HLSP, based on: ‚àö the results of an attitude survey among Health Care\n","professionals in Europe; ‚àö the results of Risk Analysis exercises conducted at the four hospitals\n","acting as reference centres; ‚àö the results of the analysis of existing and emerging data protection\n","legislation throughout Europe; ‚àö relevant international literature. The second phase consisted of\n","the evaluation of the draft HLSP produced by the first phase by Health Care professionals, Health\n","Informaticians and management. The third phase consisted of the evaluation of the draft HLSP by all\n","SEISMED partners and resulted in the current document. The end result is a compromise between\n","several different (but mostly fundamentally convergent) opinions expressed by project participants\n","or external experts; nevertheless it is felt that this has not led into major internal\n","inconsistencies or contradictions. It is also felt that the HLSP should undergo a further, lengthy\n","period of implementation in several HCEs across Europe, so it can be verified, amended, or modified\n","according to everyday practice. ¬© 1996 The Authors.

Such measures will not give value to efforts that make a network\n","component more difficult to exploit. Similarly, Risk Assessment Models (RAMs) are used to quantify\n","the importance of a component to overall network performance (again measured in terms of reliability\n","or flow) but do not prescribe improvement strategies. This study develops a prescriptive RAM that\n","includes an MOE called invulnerability. This gives value to efforts that make a component more\n","difficult to exploit. Results show that including the vulnerability MOE as a second criterion to\n","complement the reliability MOE allows one to formulate component-hardening strategies. Furthermore,\n","the Pareto-efhcient frontier generated by trading off these two MOEs is very small. This helps to\n","pinpoint specific components that should be improved or hardened for information security. ¬© 1999\n","Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

[Wang X., 1999]: Introduction: Fiber optic code division multiple access (CDMA) is\n","an attractive choice for broadband fiber optic LANs owing to its unique attributes of all optical\n","processing, asynchronous transmission, soft capacity, low delay access, and high information\n","security[ 11. Previously, the encodeldecode operations of fiber optic CDMA schemes have been\n","realized by fiber-optic delay lines, planar lightwave circuits (for coherent or incoherent temporal\n","coding schemes)[2,3], spatial light modulators and masks (for spectral or spatial coding\n","schemes)[4,5]. In this paper, a novel hybrid temporaVspectral coding technique based on fiber Bragg\n","gratings (FBGs) for fiber optic CDMA application is proposed and demonstrated experimentally for the\n","first time. Experiment: The experimental setup and configuration of the encodeddecoder are shown in\n","figure 1. In the experiment, the encoder/decoder was constructed by five FBGs with center\n","wavelengths from 15441x11 to 1552nm and spaced 2nm apart. Their bandwidth was about OSnm and\n","reflectivity was over 99.9%. The FBGs were positioned serially along an optical fiber in the pattern\n","of a prime code (1000010000100001000010000)[6] separated by the same distance of 80cm (corresponding\n","to 8ns delay). Thus, the input optical pulses from the laser diode with a mode spacing of OSnm were\n","encoded in a hybrid temporahpectral mode by the encoder into pulse trains as shown in Fig.2. The\n","input signals were modulated by an electro-optic modulator driven by 25Mbit/s data from the pattern\n","generator. The coded signals were then transmitted through 1 lkm dispersion shifted fiber before\n","entering the novel FBG decoder which performed the correlation operation in both temporal and\n","spectral domain. Two decoder configurations were tested in our experiments. The correct decoder was\n","as shown in Fig. 1. The incorrect decoder was identical to the encoder shown in the figure, i.e. it\n","was an end-To-end inversion of the correct decoder. After the correlation operation, the correctly\n","decoded signals were represented by high level pulses without any sidelobes corresponding to each\n","bit ' 1 ' while the incorrectly decoded signals appeared as pseudonoise pulse trains (Fig.3.a). The\n","output eye diagram was shown in Fig.3.b.

In this context, the establishment of information security management standards, such as the BS 7799 British standard, has provided a structured framework for organizations to implement and manage their information security practices effectively. These standards emphasize the importance of conducting comprehensive risk analyses to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities within information systems and to develop appropriate mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the adoption of public-key infrastructure (PKI) technologies, including the deployment of certificate authorities and the use of digital signatures, has significantly enhanced the security of digital communications and transactions. The integration of access control lists and advanced error detection mechanisms, such as the two-dimensional parity check scheme, further strengthens the security posture of information systems. The application of privacy amplification techniques in cryptographic protocols ensures the resilience of encryption keys against potential compromises.\\n\\nThe mathematical foundations of cryptographic algorithms, including modular exponentiation and the Montgomery algorithm, play a critical role in the security of public-key cryptosystems. The exploration of elliptic curve cryptography introduces an additional layer of security by leveraging the mathematical properties of elliptic curves for key generation and encryption processes. The concept of rational linear reparameterization, applied to NURBS curves and surfaces, as well as to other parametric curves and surfaces, offers a novel approach to embedding security features directly within the geometric representations of digital assets, thereby preserving their integrity and authenticity.\\n\\nThe development and adoption of the Common Criteria and the establishment of the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) represent significant milestones in the standardization of information security practices. The Defense Goal Security Architecture (DGSA) introduces a paradigm shift in information security by focusing on the protection and sharing of information across multiple information domains, without being constrained by specific hardware or software architectures. This approach is facilitated by the concept of harmonization of information security requirements, which seeks to align the security functions of information systems with the overarching security objectives of organizations. The Common Criteria process, encompassing risk analysis technologies and the evaluation phase, provides a comprehensive methodology for the specification, implementation, and verification of security functions based on defined security objectives.\\n\\nThe role of organizational modeling in information security is underscored by the need to translate organizational objectives for information security into specific security function specifications. This translation process is supported by information security harmonization functions, which enable the derivation of technical security policies from high-level security objectives. The integration of security objectives into the technical architecture of information systems ensures that security considerations are embedded within the design and operational phases of system development, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of organizations. This holistic approach to information security management, encompassing both technical and organizational dimensions, underscores the importance of a strategic and coordinated effort to safeguard digital assets and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information in an increasingly interconnected and digitalized world.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":62}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"6HYcFxna5BEx"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["summarized_text_80['output_text']"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":120},"id":"z4OdqVJRH3Q2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713392069265,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":103,"user":{"displayName":"Andres Leiva","userId":"13924510545082436192"}},"outputId":"38f96f3e-9b6f-4f27-b5c5-c3f6d7382021"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"ENTITIES: retail and international banking; secure handling of secret parameters; nuclear material accountability; security compliance analysis model; military and defense systems; International Information Flow debate; protection of information methods; exploitation of unclassified and classified information; information security issues; digital electronic information security; Overclassification; disaster recovery; protected storage and processing; data integrity policy; hacker threats; extensions to standard operating systems; computer security in hospital management; SAGAT system; federal government policies; acceptance of security controls; microcomputer systems security; security status review; true information security; communication and computer security; data security concepts; local area networks; Logical Coprocessing Kernel project; intrusion and theft prevention; computer network security; strategic planning for information security; biometric measurement devices; information security risk management; managerial aspects of systems security; operations security; INFOSEC challenges in advanced avionics; securing APL database applications; office computer systems for cardiologists; partnership of people, machines, and communications; security of security; predicate-based security model; bar-coding technique for patient identification; selling the need for computer security; risk assessment methods; cause-and-effect model; computer security based on hard problems; security to statistical databases; computer security standards; security needs in Western Europe; protection of intellectual property; organizational placement of computer security; network of automated image-processing systems; information security classification system; rapid transit system security; space station information system; information security management system; information flow in programs; INFOSEC in integrated avionic systems; conference key distribution systems; electronic office security problems; sensitive, unclassified industrial information; Cryptography bibliography; control problems in small information systems; safeguarding information on floppy diskettes; Information Resource Management; network control and security; recognition of computer networks in developing nations.\\n\\nSUMMARY: The literature on Information Assurance, Security, and Cybersecurity is vast and diverse, addressing various facets from the technical to the managerial and policy-making aspects. In the realm of banking, [Evans M., 1985] highlights the critical need for up-to-date information and security in retail and international banking, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding financial transactions and customer data. The secure handling of secret parameters, as discussed by [Wood C.C., 1986], is fundamental to the security of computer and data communications systems, involving elements such as passwords, PINs, encryption keys, and biometric identifiers. The development and operation of a computer system for nuclear material accountability, described in [McEvers J.A., 1980], underscores the dual objectives of enhancing material control and ensuring information security within a high-stakes environment. [Tyra Neil W., 1985] introduces the security compliance analysis model (SCAM), a tool for evaluating security requirement satisfaction across various domains, highlighting the complexity of achieving comprehensive security compliance.\\n\\nThe significance of information security in military and defense systems is elaborated in [Anon, 1983], where the integration of electronics and computers in defense mechanisms necessitates robust security measures. The discussion on the International Information Flow debate by [van Tongeren H., 1985] situates information security within a broader societal and international context, indicating its relevance beyond technical considerations. [Conley Robert E., 1987] reviews several methods for the protection of information, emphasizing the alignment with management policy and intent, which is crucial for effective security implementation. The challenge of securing both unclassified and classified information against exploitation is addressed by [Matchett Noel D., 1987], pointing to the evolving methods required to safeguard sensitive data.\\n\\n[Steele Robert W., 1987] identifies seven key information security issues, ranging from the information explosion to the cost of security technology, illustrating the multifaceted nature of information security challenges. The advancement of digital electronic information security technologies is overviewed by [Andreassen A.L., 1988], reflecting on the shift in focus brought about by computing science advancements. The problem of Overclassification and its impact on information and personnel security systems is explored in [Kaiser F.M., 1986], highlighting the disagreements over its seriousness and potential remedies. The concept of disaster recovery, as part of a comprehensive Information Security and Control Program, is exemplified in [Walker Douglas D., 1984]'s discussion on General Electric's approach, underscoring the importance of preparedness and resilience.\\n\\nThe role of protected storage and processing of security parameters through hardware/firmware-based security modules is detailed in [Wood C.C., 1986], indicating a move towards more secure methods of handling sensitive information. [Clark David D., 1987] presents a policy for data integrity based on commercial data processing practices, comparing it with the lattice model for information security and arguing for distinct mechanisms to control disclosure and ensure integrity. The evolving threat landscape, with hacker threats gaining prominence, is discussed in [Kirkwood Timothy J., 1989], pointing to the need for security measures that address both system design and policy administration. The risks associated with extensions to standard operating systems in computing centers are outlined in [Paans R., 1985], emphasizing the importance of secure design requirements for user SuperVisor Calls (SVCs).\\n\\nIn the healthcare sector, [Ravella J.A., 1987] highlights the critical need for information security in hospital management, advocating for the implementation of comprehensive computer security plans to protect valuable information. The design and operation of the SAGAT system for information-assurance in synthesis processes are considered in [RAZUMOVSKII S.N., 1982], illustrating the application of methodological principles of error control. The examination of US federal government policies directed at protecting information, especially in electronic communications systems, by [Anon, 1988], reflects on the vulnerability of these systems and the importance of safeguarding information. The role of human factors in the success of information security efforts is emphasized by [Parker Donn B., 1983], noting that technical controls must be complemented by personnel procedures and requirements to be effective.\\n\\nThe importance of security measures for microcomputer systems, as discussed by [Adney William M., 1987], highlights the need for comprehensive procedures covering physical security, information security, and disaster recovery. The development of a technique for reviewing the security status of information resources within an organization, as presented by [Persson J.Alvar, 1986], offers a practical approach to addressing security problems. The evolving awareness of the need for true information security in finance, industry, and government, despite a lag in action, is discussed in [Polis R.I., 1984], pointing to the development and installation of sophisticated security measures based on risk analysis.
