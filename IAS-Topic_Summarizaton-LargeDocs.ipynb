Today\\u2019s children grow up with a lot of technology, such as phones, gaming systems, tablets and computers. Even \\u2018things\\u2019 are connected to the Internet. Such things include door locks, coffee makers, refrigerators, thermostats, and speakers to name a few. There are more Internet of Things devices than there are people worldwide. Connected things have changed lives of people and the world in a lot of positive ways, but they also come with numerous security and privacy issues. Thus, cybersecurity education has become crucial in providing security awareness, secure behavior and cybersecurity expertise. This paper discusses TWOPD, a novel approach to teaching cybersecurity in a college classroom and evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\",\n          \"[Adachi S., 2013]: NTT Innovation Institute, Inc.

We asked Shin Adachi, the Lead Security Analyst at the center of security-related work at NTT I3, about the current status of information security and the benefits of establishing NTT I3 as a center for research and development in North America.\",\n          \"[Walker T., 2020]: One of the core functions of financial institutions is risk management. Until recently, most institutions have focused on concepts such as cyclical variations in their business and the economy, their exposure to low and even negative interest rates, and the consequences of various other macroeconomic developments and internal decisions on their profit margins, solvency, and efficiency, among others. Our world is changing, and individuals and businesses are increasingly affected by factors that arise from outside the economy and the financial markets, yet display multiple interactions with the eco-financial system. Today\\u2014arguably more than ever\\u2014financial institutions face a variety of new challenges that require them to seriously rethink their risk management and investment practices. Climate change, mass migration, political extremism, trade wars, terrorism, cybersecurity threats, and the current evolution of financial technology (FinTech) are just some examples of ecological, societal, and technological factors that affect and interact with our financial markets. This book aims to highlight not only the threats but also the opportunities associated with these emerging risks, thereby providing an inspiration for academics, practitioners, and regulators who already work in or are interested in this field. \\u00a9 2020, The Author(s).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-2030eb86-87c5-4961-aa2e-4278c089e9c4\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Year</th>\n","      <th>abstract</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>43742</th>\n","      <td>2022</td>\n","      <td>[Silberman D.M., 2022]: This paper describes a...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>38012</th>\n","      <td>2021</td>\n","      <td>[Chhetri C., 2021]: In today’s world, technolo...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>30596</th>\n","      <td>2020</td>\n","      <td>[Walker T., 2020]: One of the core functions o...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>29412</th>\n","      <td>2020</td>\n","      <td>[Bernal S.L., 2020]: Bacteria are microorganis...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>11057</th>\n","      <td>2013</td>\n","      <td>[Adachi S., 2013]: NTT Innovation Institute, I...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-2030eb86-87c5-4961-aa2e-4278c089e9c4')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-2030eb86-87c5-4961-aa2e-4278c089e9c4 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

However, the data produced by modern system/network logs pose many problems, such as the streaming and non-stationary nature of such data, their volume and velocity, and the presence of imbalanced classes. Classifier ensembles look a valid solution for this scenario, owing to their flexibility and scalability. In particular, data-driven schemes for combining the predictions of multiple classifiers have been shown superior to traditional fixed aggregation criteria (e.g., predictions’ averaging and weighted voting). In intrusion detection settings, however, such schemes must be devised in an efficient way, since (part of) the ensemble may need to be re-trained frequently. A novel ensemble-based framework is proposed here for the online intrusion detection, where the ensemble is updated through an incremental stream-oriented learning scheme, correspondingly to the detection of concept drifts. Differently from mainstream ensemble-based approaches in the field, our proposal relies on deriving, though an efficient genetic programming (GP) method, an expressive kind of combiner function defined in terms of (non-trainable) aggregation functions. This approach is supported by a system architecture, which integrates different kinds of functionalities, ranging from the drift detection, to the induction and replacement of base classifiers, up to the distributed computation of GP-based combiners. Experiments on both artificial and real-life datasets confirmed the validity of the approach. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer
