Such parameters include log-on passwords, Personal Identification Numbers(PINs), encryption keys, encryption Initialization Vectors (IVs), pseudo-random number-generator quantities, and biometric personal identification quantities like digitized fingerprints. The greater dependency on such security parameters will be the natural outgrowth of both the increasing sophistication and the increasing computerization of security functions. A new approach to protected storage and protected processing of security parameters is the use of a special type of hardware/firmware-based equipment variously referred to as security modules, tamper-resistant modules, and cryptographic security modules. This paper describes representative functions that security modules perform, the benefits to be derived when security modules are deployed, and some current and future applications of this new technology. © 1986.',\n"," \"A computer system that has been developed for nuclear material accountability and has been operating in an active radiochemical processing plant involving remote operations is described.

This situation is frequently encountered and is caused by too much emphasis on the technical aspects and too little attention to the managerial aspects of systems security. Many of us in the systems security field immerse ourselves in fascinating technical details at the expense of the managerial issues essential to the success of a systems security effort. This article-discusses the managerial perspectives with which an appropriate balance between the managerial and the technical may be struck. Although each organization has its idiosyncrasies, experience has shown that a number of common approaches to managing an information systems security function are both effective and prudent. While there exists no standard template with which one can design a systems security function, this article illuminates some tried-and-true methods associated with organizational design, raising the level of management awareness, and obtaining needed resources. This article is based partly on a panel discussion for which the author was the moderator, an informal poll of San Francisco bay area systems security administrators and EDP auditors, and the author's information systems security consulting experience. \\u00a9 1987.\",\n          \"Unnecessary and unwarranted classification adversely affects both information and personnel security systems in a variety of ways.
