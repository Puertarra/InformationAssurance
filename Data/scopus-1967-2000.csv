As the techniques of physical security are well known and simple to apply, this chapter stresses on the problems and prospects for protecting data or information in multi-user computer environments. The emphasis is on the threats inherent in programming and using a system rather than various forms of internal and external penetration of the “smash-and-grab” variety, or the subversion of employees having legitimate access to a system. Not discussed at any length are the topics of administrative controls, physical security techniques, personnel screening, and many other aspects of security that are required in greater or lesser degree to devise a secure system. One is often confronted with the question: Is it possible to build a completely secure system? The answer must be unqualifiedly negative. However, it is possible to build an adequately secure system for a particular operational environment. The chapter shows that there is no single set of measures that can be taken to obtain “instant security.” Information security is a problem of providing sufficient barriers and controls to force a prospective penetrator into attacks that carry a high risk of detection and/or have a very large work factor. The work factor, if high enough, will be sufficient to deter all but the most dedicated penetrator, and for him it may make any eventual success a hollow victory. © 1972, Academic Press Inc.","",""

Such parameters include log-on passwords, Personal Identification Numbers(PINs), encryption keys, encryption Initialization Vectors (IVs), pseudo-random number-generator quantities, and biometric personal identification quantities like digitized fingerprints. The greater dependency on such security parameters will be the natural outgrowth of both the increasing sophistication and the increasing computerization of security functions. A new approach to protected storage and protected processing of security parameters is the use of a special type of hardware/firmware-based equipment variously referred to as security modules, tamper-resistant modules, and cryptographic security modules. This paper describes representative functions that security modules perform, the benefits to be derived when security modules are deployed, and some current and future applications of this new technology. © 1986.","cryptographic security module; Security module; tamper-resistant module","CRYPTOGRAPHY; SECURE STORAGE; SECURITY MODULE; SOFTWARE PROTECTION; TAMPER-RESISTANT MODULE; DATA PROCESSING"

The model provides a means for compiling independently derived compliance evaluations over the broad spectrum of security issues: COMSEC, OPSEC, TEMPEST and Red/Black, ADPE security, physical security, information security, industrial security, and system security areas. The model relates these broad security issues to their constituent parameters (partitioning, shielding, isolation, separation, etc. ) via a hierarchical tree structure. Also provided is a means for assigning relational weighting factors that signify the parameter's relative significance to the overall security category. Finally, the model interprets compliance factors and proceeds through a mathematical algorithm to generate a series of scoring values that may be graphed over time.","","MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS - Space Applications; MILITARY ENGINEERING - Electronic Countermeasures; COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS; DATA SECURITY; DATA PROCESSING"

After investment of considerable resources, and prolonged waiting for results, many efforts can demonstrate little if any significant improvement. This is largely due to a lack of planning. Many efforta lack explicitly articulated plans as well as specific performance milestones. Although many are loathe to admit it, information security efforts at many organizations lack formal planning and performance monitoring. Management's dissatisfaction with information security is exemplified by the seriously inadequate staffing levels found at a large number of organizations. When management is convinced that information security is a prudent investment, they will respond with additional resources. This article examines why information security efforts are often ineffective and why more formal planning efforts can alleviate this condition. It discusses tools best used to prepare an action plan for information security and gives some tips on how to sell such a plan to management. Also discussed are organizational design, policies, standards, and guidelines and other elements of a foundation that is required if an effective information security planning process is to be sustained.

Historically, paper money and hard currency have been sequestered in steel and concrete vaults, with combination locks on the doors. Later, money was transferred via paper checks that were processed manually. Today, most money is stored in electronic form inside computer systems, which are the new vaults. So the current focus is on making computer systems more secure to protect electronic money as well as sensitive information.

Although computers and networks might have been involved, the unhappy, misled, or careless employee operating from the inside with the benefit of privileged access was the usual perpetrator of damages or embezzlement. More recently, hackers from the outside without special access authorizations have gained the spotlight as they use various public and private networks to gain corporate intelligence, transfer free services to friends, or disrupt data processing activities. Illustrative of the importance of security in the Government sector is the example of a case of electronic eavesdropping that affected East-West negotiations and subsequently the price of wheat and bread in this country. The weaknesses exploited in many of the more recent hacker cases represent a combination of naive system design and lax administration.

Sound design is encouraged by using a technique called Structured Specification, in which successively more detailed models of the Security Kernel are developed. The initial model, M0, is an abstract description which formalizes governmental security applied to computer systems. Subsequent levels of modeling provide increasingly more detail, and gradually the models begin to resemble a particular system (Multics in this case). The second model, M1, defines a tree-structured file system, and an interagent communication system while M2 adds details concerning segmentation in a dynamic environment. It is intended that the final level of modeling will specify the primitive commands for the kernel of a Multics-like system and will enumerate precisely those assertions which must be proved about the implementation in order to establish correctness. © 1975, ACM.

Management of office business functions is common; handling and scientific analysis of practice medical information are less common. The cardiologist can also access national medical information systems for literature searches and for interactive further education. Selection and testing of programs and the entire computer system before purchase of computer hardware will reduce the chances of disappointment or serious problems. Personnel pretraining and planning for office information flow and medical information security are necessary. Some cardiologists design their own office systems, buy hardware and software as needed, write programs for themselves and carry out the implementation themselves.

It is currently unclear whether or not there really exists such an ideal block cipher. So to meet the requirements of practical applications, the best thing we can do is to construct a block cipher such that it approximates the ideal one as closely as possible.

As a decision making and risk assessment tool, rigorous risk analysis is not only capable of identifying potential losses that could be unacceptable for a given system, but it can be used to determine which specific security controls and counter measures can be effective and justifiable by management-set criteria. The Livermore Risk Analysis Methodology (LRAM) was developed in accord with these principles.

Security-control methods suggested in the literature are classified into four general approaches: conceptual, query restriction, data perturbation, and output perturbation. Criteria for evaluating the performance of the various security-control methods are identified. Security-control methods that are based on each of the four approaches are discussed, together with their performance with respect to the identified evaluation criteria. A detailed comparative analysis of the most promising methods for protecting dynamic-online statistical databases is also presented. To date no single security-control method prevents both exact and partial disclosures. There are, however, a few perturbation-based methods that prevent exact disclosure and enable the database administrator to exercise “statistical disclosure control.” Some of these methods, however introduce bias into query responses or suffer from the 0/1 query-set-size problem (i.e., partial disclosure is possible in case of null query set or a query set of size 1). We recommend directing future research efforts toward developing new methods that prevent exact disclosure and provide statistical-disclosure control, while at the same time do not suffer from the bias problem and the 0/1 query-set-size problem. Furthermore, efforts directed toward developing a bias-correction mechanism and solving the general problem of small query-set-size would help salvage a few of the current perturbation-based methods. © 1989, ACM.

One of the most efficient methods to achieve information security is to encrypt the data carrying the information. By the use of encryption the information is effectively protected against unintended disclosure. Destruction or modification is detected by verification, using methods similar to encryption.

Because protection of the information resource is becoming more and more critical for organizational survival, the organizational positioning of computer security is being investigated in this study. According to data gathered from 39 U.S. organizations with data or computer security administrators, the function is currently being relegated to lower levels in the organizational hierarchy. Security officers are most frequently being supervised by line managers in the IS (Information Systems) area. There are exceptions to this pattern, notably in financial institutions and government, but overall evolutionary trends of security unit initiation do not typically include high level reporting relationships. From the standpoint of the need for independent watchguards, this policy is unwise. A normative model for organizational placement of the security function is offered as a solution to the present state of affairs. Use of this prescriptive model should greatly assist IS and top corporate managers in administering the information security area. © 1988.","Hierarchical placement of computer security; Organizational structuring of EDP audit; Organizational structuring of security; Principle of control independence","MANAGEMENT; COMPUTER SECURITY; EDP AUDIT; ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURING OF SECURITY; DATA PROCESSING"

The operating concept is equally innovative with driverless trains and self-service ticketing at unmanned stations. Roving staff provide information, security, ticket inspection and system supervision. The system has been highly successful in its 3 1/2 years of operation, carrying 90 million passengers safely with high reliability. Ridership has reached projections and extensive development around stations has demonstrated the economic benefits of the system.

He concludes that INFOSEC in integrated avionic systems requires a coherent set of operational/system security policies and trusted computing base designs supported by communication security (COMSEC) and TEMPEST techniques. This coherence prevents costly overkill and inadequate designs. Full time INFOSEC engineering from each INFOSEC technology must be included in the avionic system design from the beginning.","","Aircraft, Military; Data Processing--Security of Data; Information Security; Integrated Avionic Systems; Security Policies; Avionics"

To perform the encryption and decryption the transmitter and receiver(s) ought to have matching encryption and decryption keys. A clever way to generate these keys is to use the public key distribution system invented by Diffie and Hellman. That system, however, admits only one pair of communication stations to share a particular pair of encryption and decryption keys. The public key distribution system is generalized to a conference key distribution system (CKDS) which admits any group of stations to share the same encryption and decryption keys. The analysis reveals two important aspects of any conference key distribution system. One is the multitap resistance, which is a measure of the information security in the communication system. The other is the separation of the problem into two parts: the choice of a suitable symmetric function of the private keys and the choice of a suitable one-way mapping thereof. We have also shown how to use CKDS in connection with public key ciphers and an authorization scheme. © 1982. IEEE. All rights reserved.","","ENCRYPTION; DATA TRANSMISSION"

Without a doubt, in computer security the risks are high, and the problems and their solutions are complex; nonetheless, the emphasis of this attention has been misplaced. The emphasis should be primarily on the security of information itself and secondarily on the devices that handle information and on any of the other factors that go into information production. The factors of information production should certainly be considered, but only after planning and analysis based on information has been completed. For example, when considering the possibility that a competitor may steal your firm's proprietary information, it is best to consider first what information should be safequarded and what expenditure is warranted for such protection; then one can consider the environments in which this information appears (paper-based, computerized, verbal, etc.) and controls that are appropriate for these environments. This paper explores the application to the information security area of Information Resource Management (IRM), a new and promising approach that concentrates, on information not on computers. This paper explains the concepts underlying IRM, how they are applied, and what general information systems benefits can be obtained. In a more specifically security-oriented sense, it indicates how IRM can help address a few of the pressing problems now encountered by information security practitioners: controls suboptimization, the Maginot Line syndrome, top management understanding and support, disaster recovery planning, security policy-making, consideration of noncomputerized information, and expeditious resolution of security problems. © 1983.","Computer Security; Data Dictionary; Information Architecture; Information Auditing; Information Control; Information economics; Information Locator System; Information Management; Information Resource Management; Information Resources Management; Information Security; IRM; Metadata; Metainformation; Value of Information","DATA PROCESSING"

Instead, we are designing a Security Kernel which will provide information security. The kernel's job is to monitor information flow in order to prevent compromise of security. Sound design is encouraged by using a technique called Structured Specification, in which successively more detailed models of the Security Kernel are developed. The initial model, M0, is an abstract description which formalizes governmental security applied to computer systems. Subsequent levels of modeling provide increasingly more detail, and gradually the models begin to resemble a particular system (Multics in this case). The second model, M1, defines a treestructured file system, and an -interagent communication system while M2 adds details concerning segmentation in a dynamic environment. It is intended that the final level of modeling will specify the primitive commands for the kernel of a Multics-like system and will enumerate precisely those assertions which must be proved about the implementation in order to establish correctness. © 1975 Author.","Compromise security; Governmental security; Model; Security kernel; Security system; Structured Programming; Structured Specification",""

The usual short list of four common threats — unauthorized modification, unauthorized use, destruction, and disclosure — is clearly incomplete and redundant. For example, more extensive lists often include fraud, theft, sabotage, and espionage. However, these threats are legal abstractions that require expertise in criminal law to understand.

The Single European Market will serve as a major landmark for the restructuring of Continent-wide institutions and services. There will be major changes in European finance, governance, and technology. Unification decisions will lessen existing controls and restrictions over financial processing as well as create new conditions where controls and restrictions have not been anticipated. In either of these cases, computer crimes may well increase as a consequence of the Single European Market. This article will discuss the impact of Unification '92 on the protection of information. While much attention has been paid by security experts to the development of the information technology security evaluation criteria (ITSEC), other important but less direct decisions are being made that are related to information security. The Unification '92 decisions that will be outlined could turn out to be of great importance in determining the nature of information protection in the post-1992 era. Many EC directives and decisions, some of which are not specifically treated or labeled as information security, will substantially affect what protections will be possible as well as necessary. The major categories of these directives and decisions are: 1. (1) technical decisions on the use of computer and communications technologies 2. (2) legal decisions on how financial errors, crimes, and disagreements are defined and how they will be resolved 3. (3) political and public policy decisions on the general economy and the regulatory constraints applied to financial services operations, services, and products. Illustrations of these categories will be drawn from important EC decisions. These will include decisions on stimulating European information services, auditing standards and requirements, money-laundering controls, open borders, and electronic data interchange (EDI). © 1991.","","Data Processing - Data Handling; Data Processing - Security of Data; Information Science; Legislation - Standards; Technology - Economic and Sociological Effects; Electronic Data Interchange (EDI); European Market; Information Services"

The Korea Institute of Information Security and Cryptology (KIISC) was organized in December 1990. The KIISC is playing a leading role for promoting research activities on cryptology in Korea. Since Japan is very active in the area of cryptologic research and development since 1984, it is worth to include Japanese research activities in this paper. Also, the recent cryptologic research activities in the Republic of China (Taiwan) are introduced. With regard to the research activities from other nations in Asia, it is unfortunate not to compile their activities in this issue due to the lack of information available at the present time. © 1993, Springer Verlag.

For the foreseeable future there are no alternatives to its continued use. Within ten years unmodified single-key DES will be breakable for a cost of about $3, 500 per solution in under one day. Many financial systems which currently rely on single-key DES are therefore becoming vulnerable to attack. Despite the impact of breaking DES, the misconception that an FI’s exposure is limited to the dollar values of particular short-lived transactions may make users unwilling to undertake urgent remedial measures. They may be prepared to tolerate risks they perceive as limited and unrealistic. This view ignores the danger that a breach of key management security poses to the system as a whole. Until a new encryption standard emerges, the exposure and consequences can be avoided by the adoption of double-length keys for DES. This is technically and economically feasible. Double-length keys and unique keys per transaction should be implemented in financial systems as soon as possible. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Computer security; Data Encryption Standard; Financial institutions; Key management",""

This article illuminates fifteen of the major forces that will shape the information security market in the next five to ten years. An understanding of these forces is particularly important to those in positions related to information security, especially new product developers, marketing and sales people, and information security practitioners. New product developers need to know where the market is going to accurately predict the demand for their products as well as understand the future environment in which their products must work. Marketing and sales specialists must know what drives the marketplace so they can appreciate why the market is expanding and, in particular, why prospects buy. Information security practitioners need to know about the major forces driving the market to convincingly explain to management why an increased investment in information security is prudent. Practitioners also need to be aware of these driving forces so that they can best plan their organization's future information security activities. © 1990.","Computer security; Electronic security; Forecasting; Future developments; Information security; Information systems security; Market analysis; Market demand; Market driving forces; Market growth rates; Market projections; Market trends; Marketing research; Planning; Products and Services; Systems security","Computer Crime - Viruses; Marketing; Neural Networks; Technological Forecasting; Electronic Security; Information Security; Marketing Research; Products and Services; Data Processing"

Ironically, in many instances they do not manifest their concern by incorporating specific control measures into the systems they create, enhance, and maintain. The reason for this is that they lack a set of principles of secure information systems design, that may be used when selecting or devising control measures. Such principles can constitute a foundation for thinking about information security, assist in the proper categorization of controls by type, and facilitate prudent selection of appropriate controls from amongst these categories. Responding to the need, this article provides an overview of security principles for information systems design.

Formal models provide a solid foundation for security, making it possible to precisely specify security requirements, to reason with mathematical assurance about security issues and to prove security properties formally. However, most security models do not realistically reflect the complexity of current computer systems. The Path Context Model (PCM) is a recent formal security model attempting to solve this problem. A number of aspects of PCM have not yet been defined precisely. This paper starts by giving a formal definition of PCM. It is then shown that it is difficult to protect composite objects—objects consisting of other, less complex objects—with PCM. This problem can be solved by modifying PCM so that every level of such a composite object can do the access checks relevant to that level of the object. This is illustrated in the last section of the paper, where an object-based version of PCM is defined. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

That concern is even more heightened as the PSN moves toward an intelligent network of interconnected, interdependent, heterogeneous and distributed networks and nodes around the globe. The resulting national focus on Network Integrity issues, spawned the development of an industry commitment to affect and realize a minimum security baseline for interconnected SS7 networks. In addition the affected carriers in those outage have accelerated their pursuit of secure solutions to today's intelligent networking. This paper will focus on the development of the baseline and the current effort to take the baseline into national, e.g., National Institute of Technology and Standards (NIST), and internationally recognized standard bodies or forums, e.g., the Council of European Committees Green Book on Information Security, and the American National Standards Institute efforts on Telecommunications Management Networks within TIMl.5. Avoiding the standard broad based approach to the subject, this paper is addressed to the nationally and internationally interconnected telecommunications carrier systems managers and administrators who are often the `first comprised' and `last to know' that they, their clients and customers are at risk from the networked vulnerabilities of a trusted partner's network or the dumbing down of the deployed security technology from a vendor.","","Signal systems; Standards; Telecommunication systems; Baseline security; Interconnected signalling systems; Network integrity; Public switched networks; Security systems"

Due to system inadequacies damages can be afflicted upon subscribers which cannot be legally assessed, e.g. because of lack of evidence. Technical security helps to support obedience to laws; for example by not only protecting the subscriber from system malfunctions and malicious third parties but also from attacks by malicious communication partners. For this purpose trusted third parties are needed, that help to corroborate the authenticity of communicants and of communication acts as well as message integrity, and that can be witness in court. To secure communication systems data encryption is used; secret keys are kept in physically secure chipcards that protect them from manipulation and detection. The system software must perform its specified functions correctly and must not provide more functions than specified. Subscribers must be authenticated or possibly kept anonymous to each other. Messages must be delivered unchanged, confidentially and provably.

This questionnaire addressed issues relevant to the extent of information technology currently in use, the need for information security, classification of used information with a view towards adopting methods, techniques and legislation providing sufficient security guarantees, etc. The questionnaire was addressed to a sufficient number of employees of organized health care establishments, so that the results would be worth while and reliable. © 1991.","Classification of medical data; Information security; Medical data security; Protection of medical data",""

Since protective measures often require significant managerial vigilance, an appropriate level of awareness and concern may be a prerequisite for adequate security protection. Given its importance, there is a need for a better understanding of what leads to security concern. This paper focuses on users' perceptions about the security of their systems. Based on previous work on individuals' attitudes and beliefs about IS and IS environments, it is hypothesized that a user's concern about security is a function of three different constructs: industry risk, company actions, and individual awareness. The study tests the main assertions of the model, using a cross-sample comparison of perceptions from two different survey instruments. The first sample used 570 randomly selected DPMA members. The second sample surveyed 357 end-users. The theoretical model does provide some explanation for level of concern among IS professionals in the mainframe and minicomputer environment. Both company actions and individual awareness were statistically significant, although the explained variance was not large. Problems with using post hoc analysis may have contributed to the partial and weak support for the model. © 1991.","Computer Security, Information Security, Data Security, Security Concern, End-user Computing; User Attitudes about Security, Management of Security",""

The simple scheme consists of three phases. In the first phase the issuer of the document prepares the document, the list of prospective signatories and a pad on which signatories are to write their signatures. In the second phase each signatory verifies the document, signs it and forwards it to the next signatory. In the third phase a trusted verifier or notary decides on the validity of the signatures. The scheme prevents cheating by dishonest signatories from going undetected. The scheme is practical and offers at least the same security level afforded by its underlying cryptosystem against external attacks. Internal attacks in the form of forging or cheating by a dishonest issuer or by one or more of the signatories (alone or by collaboration) requires the solving of instances of the discrete logarithm problem.

Kruys, Comput. Secur., 8 (1989)) the approach to distributed systems security based on ten Security Facilities developed by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) is described. This paper shows how the ECMA approach to distributed access control can be applied to the design of secure systems in general and to design of secure object-oriented systems in particular. The ECMA model is based on the concept of security services for the generation and manipulation of access control and other security-related information and it identifies an abstract syntax for such information. This makes it possible to build secure distributed systems consisting of individually secure systems that communicate security control information in an open, yet secure, manner. The ECMA model is therefore complementary to, rather than in competition with, machine-oriented security solutions such as those found in UNIX and other operating systems. In object-oriented systems the ECMA model provides a very convenient solution to location-independent access control in distributed systems. It also has many advantages in terms of the flexibility and the precision that can be achieved; Clark-Wilson type policies are naturally implemented on this basis. A closing note shows how the ECMA work and MIT's Kerberos are related. © 1991.","Distributed processing; ECMA; Information security; ISO; Kerberos; Object-oriented systems; Open systems","Computer Networks - Security Systems; Computer Programming - Object Oriented Programming; Computer Security; Distributed Processing; Information Security; Object-Oriented Systems; Open Systems; Computer Systems, Digital"

Problems notwithstanding, the demand for usable and reliable automated tools remains: risk analysis and management form key elements in every information security policy, every text on data security and every attempt at standardization. Clearly risk control is a central task in security administration. This paper outlines progress in an Information Security Research Centre project which is aimed at developing novel software prototypes to address these problems. The concept used is that of a `risk data repository' (RDR) which forms an integral part of the information systems life cycle. Its role is to supply the best available data about a system's risk-relevant aspects, as these progress from initial design-stage assumptions by different stakeholders about expected system use, to a fully-operational state with actual users. A major objective is to demonstrate where mismatches in assumptions, and hence potential or actual vulnerabilities, are present. Novel features in the repository architecture include: active (dynamic) data evaluation via an object-oriented implementation: the RDR interfaces with organizational passive database schemata in order to capture risk-relevant facts and/or rules about data items and aggregates; conceptual separation of information confidentiality and integrity risk from the risk due to system delivery uncertainty: in this way, risk data about information can outlive risk data about any particular platform carrying the information; an interface designed for asynchronous use by stakeholders, e.g., database administrators, application developers, computer system administrators and communications network managers.","","Computer crime; Data handling; Data structures; Database systems; Information dissemination; Information management; Information retrieval; Management information systems; Mathematical models; Risk assessment; Standardization; Risk data repository; Security risk modelling; Security of data"

Cryptographic techniques can play an important role in protecting communication links and file data, since access to data can be limited to those who hold the proper key. In the case of file data, however, the routine use of encryption facilities often places the organizational requirements of information security in opposition to those of information management. Since strong encryption implies that only the holders of the cryptographic key have access to the cleartext data, an organization may be denied the use of its own critical business records if the key used to encrypt these records becomes unavailable (e.g., through the accidental death of the key holder). This paper describes a system, based on cryptographic ""smartcards,"" for the temporary ""escrow"" of file encryption keys for critical files in a cryptographic file system. Unlike conventional escrow schemes, this system is bilaterally auditable, in that the holder of an escrowed key can verify that, in fact, he or she holds the key to a particular directory and the owner of the key can verify, when the escrow period is ended, that the escrow agent has neither used the key nor can use it in the future. We describe a new algorithm, based on the DES cipher, for the online encryption of file data in a secure and efficient manner that is suitable for use in a smartcard. © 1994 USENIX Association.

This is because they have some advantages such as robustness against interference and noise, low probability of intercept, anti-jamming property, high communication capacity per frequency and so on. Some of these features have given spread spectrum systems reputation that they have high information security. A purpose of this paper is to examine this reputation. It is often claimed that in some spread spectrum communication systems, noise and interference have much higher power than the desired signal so that any opponent who does not know the spreading mechanism cannot detect the signal. It is shown, however, that the knowledge of the spreading mechanism gives legitimate users at most about 5 dB advantage of signal to noise ratio over opponents. Therefore, in order to protect privacy, it is recommended to encrypt transmitting data. From the viewpoint of privacy, untraceablity is also important. We propose a registration protocol for cellular systems to keep users unidentified by opponents. From the aspects of information security, the most significant feature peculiar to spread spectrum systems is anti-jamming property. We discuss some designing methodology for spreading mechanisms to strengthen this property. © 1995, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CDMA; Cellular system; Information security; Jamming; Spread spectrum system; Untraceabitity","Code division multiple access; Cryptography; Jamming; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personal communication systems; Security of data; Security systems; Signal to noise ratio; Spectroscopy; Cellular mobile communications; Cellular system; Commercial applications; Communication capacity; Low probability of intercept; Spread spectrum systems; Untraceabitity; Wireless personal communications; Spread spectrum communication"

In December of 1993, a management team, comprised almost entirely of individuals with manned spaceflight operations experience, was given the charter of completing the development. Past practices and conventional thinking have been set aside in an effort to deliver the new control center ""better, faster, and cheaper"". This new paradigm has carried-over to the engineering associated with securing the control center's information resources. The group originally tasked with ensuring the security of the MCC's information resources was not directly associated with development or operations of the MCC, and thus had lost sight of the fact that the MCC's mission is the command and control of space vehicles, not the pursuit of information security. Under the new paradigm for control center development, responsibility for ensuring system security and integrity has been brought into the development organization. Old methods and approaches to security have been replaced by a new approach which emphasizes the implementation of an automated information systems security architecture that is both logical and cost effective. In both Government, and industry, it is common for those tasked with information security responsibilities to be separated from the mainstream of engineering. This separation often results in conflict during requirements definition, design, implementation and testing. The following is a case study of such an information security organization, and process, run amok. It also discusses the steps required to bring the process back into line with the goals of cost-effective development and operation. © 1994 ACM.","","Cost effectiveness; Human resource management; Information systems; Manned space flight; NASA; Security of data; Security systems; Space flight; Automated information; Command and control; Development and operations; Implementation cost; Information resource; Information security organizations; Mission control centers; Requirements definition; Costs"

That concern is even more heightened as the PSN moves toward an intelligent network of interconnected, interdependent, heterogeneous and distributed networks and nodes around the globe. A National Research Council report in 1991 helped define the overall scope of the problem at hand: 'Computer systems are coming of age. As computer systems become more prevalent, sophisticated, embedded in physical processes, and interconnected, society becomes more vulnerable to poor system design, accidents that disable systems and attacks on computer systems . . . . without adequate safeguards, we risk intrusions into personal privacy (given the growing electronic storage of personal information) and potential disasters that can cause economic and even human losses'.[1] The PSN outages of 1990 and 1991 e.g., the SS7 networks of one US based Multinational IEC in the Winter of 1990, followed by the loss of two LECs' SS7 networks in the Summer of 1991, followed by major network outages in the Fall of 1991 of an IEC's network supporting the Federal Aviation Agency's communications between airport control towers in a major Northeastern Metropolitan area, caused considerable concern and attention to be directed at the problem of network integrity, security and assurance. The focus of much of that work has been on finding and addressing network integrity root-cause issues, e.g., software errors, power failures, and SS7 link diversity or lack thereof. In addition considerable attention has been focused on the need to assure that adequate security mechanisms are in-place to safeguard the evolving PSN and the critical public commerce and safety resources it supports. The resulting national focus on Network Integrity issues, spawned the development of an industry commitment to affect and realize a minimum security baseline for interconnected SS7 networks. In addition the affected carriers in those outage have accelerated their pursuit of secure solutions to today's intelligent networking.[2] This paper will focus on the development of the baseline and the current effort to take the baseline into national, e.g., National Institute of Technology and Standards (NIST), and internationally recognized standard bodies or forums, e.g., the Council of European Committees Green Book on Information Security, and the American National Standards Institute efforts on Telecommunications Management of Networks within T1M1.5. Avoiding the standard broad based approach to the subject, this paper is addressed to the nationally and internationally interconnected telecommunications carrier systems managers and administrators who are often the 'first compromised' and 'last to know' that they, their clients and customers are at risk from the networked vulnerabilities of a trusted partner's network or the dumbing down of the deployed security technology from a vendor.","","Computer systems; Failure analysis; Information use; Large scale systems; Switching networks; Telecommunication networks; Interconnected signaling system; Intrusion; Network integrity; Public switched network; Security of data"

Tight security requirements, such as those that result in silent masking of witholding of true information from a user or the introduction of false information into query answers, also raise fundamental questions about the meaning of the database and the semantics of accompanying query languages. In this paper, we propose a belief-based semantics for secure databases, which provides a semantics for databases that can “lie” about the state of the world, or about their knowledge about the state of the world, in order to preserve security. This kind of semantics can be used as a helpful retrofit for the proposals for a “multilevel secure” database model 1994, and may be useful for less restrictive security policies as well. We also propose a family of query languages for multilevel secure relational database applications, and base the semantics of those languages on our semantics for secure databases. Our query languages are free of the semantic problems associated with use of ordinary SQL in a multilevel secure context, and should be easy for users to understand and employ. © 1994, ACM.

A new model of security, the filter model, is then presented and explained. The filter model is based on the premise that each action that may be taken to improve the security of information systems is limited in its effect. In particular each action will only reduce the vulnerability to some security threats, and not to others. While this is recognized by supporters of all security models, it is the key concept on which the filter model is founded, thus setting this model apart from other common models. The filter model proposed in this paper goes further to include two levels of effectiveness, and uses a matrix presentation to summarize predicted effectiveness. The model as presented in this paper is at a high level of generality, with only five categories of security action and seven categories of threat being considered.

The identification and selection of countermeasures form part of most risk analysis approaches. Risk analysis packages compete to obtain a maximal or at least a comprehensive knowledge base of countermeasures. Identifying and selecting countermeasures from an organization-specific rather than from a product point of view in this sea of alternatives presents a problem. A holistic approach is required that will not only improve management's conceptual understanding of the issue, but will also enable the establishment of a linkage of an organization's information security requirements with product evaluation, and also with international standards defined for Information Security Products. This paper proposes a scheme for conceptually representing the requirements of an evaluation standard, and more specifically for the Trusted Computer Security Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), as well as the security requirements determined by a particular organization. Once a product has been evaluated using a particular standard, its profile can be compared with the organization's set of information security requirements.","","Computer crime; Cryptography; Data handling; Information dissemination; Information retrieval; Management information systems; Risk assessment; Standards; Countermeasures; Information security products; Trusted computer security evaluation criteria (TCSEC); Security of data"

Small computer systems are defined as personal computers, local area networks, and multi-user and similar installations, including everything from powerful network servers and scientific work-stations to notebooks, palm-tops and personal organizers. Two important differentiating characteristics of small systems environments are identified as (1) the segregation of functions that is possible in many large systems environments but frequently not possible in the smaller system context, and (2) the difficulty encountered in the small systems environment, in attracting, developing and retaining specialized technical expertise. These two characteristics are found to be common to three main small system environments: (1) small business organizational systems, (2) end user computing, and (3) down-sized/distributed computing. A framework for interrelating the characteristics of small computer systems and the three environments is proposed.","","Administrative data processing; Computer systems; Computer workstations; Data handling; Information dissemination; Information retrieval; Systems analysis; User interfaces; End user computing; Small systems; Security of data"

It also indicates some implications of the various choices one may make when designing such a database. Most secure database models have been designed for relational databases. The object-oriented database model is more complex than the relational model. For these reasons, models for secure object-oriented databases are more complex than their relational counterparts. Furthermore, since views of the object-oriented model differ, each security model has to make some assumptions about the object-oriented model used for its particular database. A number of models for secure object-oriented databases have been proposed. These models differ in many respects, because they focus on different aspects of the security problem, or because they make different assumptions about what constitutes a secure database or because they make different assumptions about the object-oriented model. The taxonomy proposed in this paper may be used to compare the various models: Models that focus on specific issues may be positioned in the broader context with the aid of the taxonomy. The taxonomy also identifies the major aspects where security models may differ and indicates some alternatives available to the system designer for each such design choice. We show some implications of using specific alternatives. Since differences between models for secure object-oriented databases are often subtle, a formal notation is necessary for a proper comparison. Such a formal notation also facilitates the formal derivation of restrictions that apply under specific conditions. The formal approach also gives a clear indication about the assumptions made by us—given as axioms—and the consequences of those assumptions 1994—given as theorems. © 1994, ACM.

In this paper we present the Stanford University Research Firewall (SURF), a network firewall design that is suitable for a research environment. While still protecting information and computing resources behind the firewall, this firewall is less restrictive of outward information flow than the traditional model; can be easily deployed; and can give internal users the illusion of unrestricted e-mail, anonymous FTP, and WWW connectivity to the greater Internet. Our experience demonstrates that an adequate firewall for a research environment can be constructed for minimal cost using off-the-shelf software and hardware components. © 1996 IEEE.","","Computer system firewalls; Web browsers; Computing resource; Corporate networks; Corporate research; Network communications; Research environment; Software and hardwares; Stanford University; Traditional models; Network security"

It is demonstrated that by the use of the Berlekamp-Massey shift-register synthesis algorithm the linear complexity value of complementary sequences is at least 3/4 of the sequence length. For some sequence pairs the linear complexity value can be even 0.98 times the sequence length.

This paper revisits the issue of database integrity and offers a new method of safeguarding the authenticity of data in database systems. The method is based on the recent development of pseudo-random function families and sibling intractable function families, rather than on the traditional use of cryptosystems. The database authentication scheme can be applied to records or fields. The advantage of the scheme lies in the fact that each record can be associated with one checksum, while each data element in the record can be verified using the checksum independently of the other data elements in the record. The security of the scheme depends on the difficulty of predicting the outputs of pseudo-random functions and on inverting the sibling intractable function family. The same approach can also be applied to the generation of encipherment keys for databases. © 1994.","Authentication; Cryptography; Database integrity; Database security; Database systems; Information security; Sibling intractable function family","Computer networks; Cryptography; Database systems; Information services; Technology; Authentication; Cryptographic checksums; Database authentication; Database filter; Database integrity; Database security; Sibling intractable function family; Security of data"

Of concern is the uncontrolled nature of this activity: systems and workstations are often interconnected without notice being given to all of the affected parties. The result has been increased user-perception of the breaches in security, especially in the form of computer takeover, data destruction, or service denial by virus, worm or trapdoor. It is expected that consciouness of these problems, and of confidentiality comprosmises, will increases in the coming months. It is posited that a principal cause of the problem is willful promiscuity and a pronounced lack of mutual suspicion. The separation kernel concept is revisited as a potential practical means of improving security protections consistent with preserving the use of legacy systems and of commercial products. © 1995 Association for Computing Machinery.

Across the range of different types of businesses, business cultures, organizational structures, information technology environments and application systems within those environments, the requirements of risk management methods for business information systems differ to a great extent. A distinctive feature of the TOPM approach is its dynamic nature, which allows a customized model to be defined for every situation considered. Addressing the need for new formal models in a holistic way, covering the full IT risk management life cycle, as well as all IT domains within the business environment, a deterministic and intuitive approach is applied in the definition of the model. Rather than approaching the analysis, assessment and management of IT risk in the conventional manner through rigidly considering domains such as hardware, software, environment and personnel, the TOPM model follows a composite approach. Matrix theory is applied for the allignment of domains. The concept of transaction routes further facilitates the integregation and alignment process. In signifying its relevance to functional organizational structures, the TOPM model is further placed in the context of the multi-disciplinary five-phased IS (information security) methodology, as formerly proposed by the authors. Various enabling technologies are introduced, some of which are often applied in mathematical modelling, others of which are applied in business functions not usually directly associated with information technology, such as financial risk management portfolio theory. © 1994.","Financial risk management; Information security; Optimization; Portfolio theory; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk identification; Risk management; Risk monitoring; Risk resolution","Financial data processing; Information management; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Risk assessment; Security of data; Portfolio theory; Target Optimum Portfolio Management (TOPM); Information technology"

These cases are also used to draw attention to several distinctions about human error which can be used to initiate analytic work so that human error can be mitigated and prevented. The authors suggest that standard techniques for dealing with errors be brought into the normal practice of information security. These techniques include probabilistic risk assessment, human reliability assessment, and task profile analyses.

Caregivers are expected to respect the confidential nature of patient information. Yet quality management programs, for example, entail systematic, efficient collection of information extracted from patient case files. Compiling ""report cards"" on managed care networks necessitates access to aggregated information on episodes of care and their outcomes. Regional provider networks; the development of comprehensive computerized patient records; and the dependence of health care reform on large-scale, highly distributed databases make the patient record even more vulnerable. Each organization must assess whether its protection of patients' privacy is sufficient. AN INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM: A logical first step in devising such a program is to establish the necessary policies, which are prerequisites to the proper development of computer systems. A policy should address such issues as the authorized access needs to sensitive information and limitations concerning secondary use; the application of technical, procedural, physical, and personnel safeguards; and the dissemination of information. Information managers should seek opportunities to install commercially secure products that meet their security requirements. CONCLUSIONS: Top management, information systems planners, and quality improvement leaders must jointly determine policies that satisfy the duty to preserve patients' confidentiality, foster the most effective use of information in the patient record, and avoid overly restrictive policies that would impede total quality management.","","Computer Security; Confidentiality; Disclosure; Government Regulation; Health Care Reform; Humans; Information Dissemination; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; United States; Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations; Professional Patient Relationship; accreditation; article; computer security; confidentiality; government regulation; health care policy; human; information dissemination; interpersonal communication; legal aspect; medical record; organization and management; Professional Patient Relationship; standard; United States"

First, the telecommunications industry is witnessing the development of Personal Communication Systems that are 'person-specific' with person to person logical connections. Second, the computer industry is in the phase of practical implementation of distributed systems concepts. In particular, the notion of open systems is a major driving force. Use of mobile personal systems in a open distributed environment raises several issues with regard to information security and system dependability. This paper addresses one key aspect of information security in such a mobile distributed environment namely that of authentication. We consider the nature of the security threat, and how it may arise in practical situations. then we describe the characteristics of the required authentication security service to counteract this threat. In particular, we outline some of the common mechanisms that can be used to provide authentication. We illustrate these issues by considering some scenarios in the areas of mobile personal information systems and client server based distributed systems, and show how the authentication mechanisms can be used to counteract the masquerading threat.","","Computer aided analysis; Information services; Security systems; Distributed system concept; Mobile personal information system; Mobile security system; Personal communication systems; Telecommunication systems"

This paper describes an evolutionary, operational experience based approach for advancing criteria to be consistent with modern information systems. Interoperable and flexible systems/components are (and will be increasingly) demanded by users. This is especially true for distributed systems. These demands are not entirely consistent with today's foundational models of security, leading to the conclusion by many individuals that earthquake proportion changes in the foundations of information security are necessary. Fundamental revisions are necessary. There is, however, substantial risk in abandoning models that have been proven to work in many environments. The road to success is based on managing the risk associated with moving toward a new vision of information system security. A spiral approach to resolving information system security issues has been proposed and is now being practiced. It consists of incremental expansion of security theories and practices (based on existing theories) with directions of advancement determined by operational experience. The experience drives theory in a evolutionary, rapid prototype verification manner.

The proposed mechanism uses the Trusted Computing Base. A unique feature of the mechanism is that security levels are assigned not only to data items (objects), but also to methods and methods are not shown to the users whose security level is lower than that of the methods. And we distinguish between the security level of a variable in a class and that in an instance and distinguish between the level of an object when it is taken by itself and it is taken as a variable or an element of another complex object. All of this realizes the policy of multilevel access control.","","Data structures; Database systems; Information security; Object oriented programming; Security of data; Multilevel access control; Trusted computing base; Cryptography"

Personal Communication Networks providing Personal Communication Services (PCS) were designed to bridge the gap between the expensive public cellular phone and the economical private cordless telephone. While cellular phone handset development is focused on reducing size and power consumption, the target for cordless telephones is price reduction. While cellular systems can support 'CPU-heavy' encryption techniques such as DH, PCS sets cannot due the high price and power consumption required. Since connectionless communication networks such as the Internet have become popular, it is important to recognize the intended data terminal(s) and to avoid fraudulent communication. Since Workstations have relatively high processing power as servers they can process multiple tasks for multiple users. Thus, they can easily be analyzed by hackers. Therefore, tamper free hardware is necessary to protect secret information, such as cipher and signature keys to encrypt or decrypt ciphertext, and to sign data. This paper describes methods for implementing a cipher and authentication LSI and how to apply the LSI to real applications. More precisely, we have developed an LSI containing the FEAL cipher function for confidential communication, the DH scheme for key distribution, and the RSA scheme for digital signature.","","Cellular telephone systems; Computer hardware; Computer workstations; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Personal communication systems; Security of data; User interfaces; Voice/data communication systems; Authentication; Cipher; Digital signature; Hackers; Key distribution crypto systems; Power consumption; Private cordless telephone; Public cellular phone; Wireless communication confidentiality; Cryptography"

In order to relieve concerns regarding the ability to trust MVS a ""Statement of Integrity"" for the system was issued by IBM in 1981. While providing a business with guarantees, this statement clearly puts the onus for managing the integrity of a given MVS implementation firmly in the hands of the site management.

This paper suggests an approach to the selective encryption of nodes in a B+-tree and a method to substitute the plaintext search keys in order to increase the security of the tree. The method is based on structures in combinatorial block designs, and it allows for faster traversal of the tree, hence improving the overall speed of query responses. It also represents a trade-off between security and performance in that the substitution method affords less security compared to encryption. The method based on block designs has the advantage of requiring only a small amount of information being kept secret. This presents a considerable savings in terms of space used to hold security-related information.","","Database systems; Information security; Performance; Security of data; Plaintext search keys; Cryptography"

Current developments in risk analysis methodologies and system security certification, e.g. ITSEC, can provide security officers with information on the current level of organisational risk and the effectiveness of security systems. However these activities are commonly undertaken as large one-off projects. Hence they do not provide the methodologies or tools that allow security officers to respond to the often ad hoc demands made upon them. This paper deals with the development of a security model for use by information security officers, either as a method of monitoring the implementation of internal security policy, or as a preparatory step before seeking certification. The model comprises three main groups of security information: information system environment, information systems and information system assets. The model serves to indicate the current state of security in the organisation. A threat to the system environment can be traced through to its potential organisational impact, taking into account the current defences in the information processing systems. The two major areas of research in the project lie in the estimation of security effectiveness from threat countermeasure diagrams, and the means of inferring business impacts from the interrelationships amongst information processing assets. Current work is directed to the implementation of the model in a hypertext and an object oriented paradigm. © 1994 ACM.","","Hypertext systems; Information systems; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Security of data; Security systems; Information processing systems; Internal security; Object oriented paradigm; Security officers; Senior management; System environment; System security; Systems and information; Information management"

(TIS) in the USA as a possible compromise scheme to meet the demands of commerce and industry for new levels of information security, particularly transaction and message confidentiality in an international and national networked environment, while meeting law enforcement demands for continued effectiveness of telecommunications line-tapping ability. These latter requirements relate to the perceived need by law enforcement agencies to make use of legitimate authorised linetapping capabilities for the gathering of appropriate intelligence and/or evidence for the purpose of fulfilling perceived roles in the protection of society from criminal activity against the potential case where such line-taps produce intercepts that are encrypted. CKE, involving the incorporation of software based cryptography in computer and network systems with associated key recovery data transmitted during data network activity and provision of “Data Recovery Centres (DRC)”, is seen as presenting a new solution to the problems encountered in the USA with the “Clipper” initiative in that country announced in 1993. This paper examines the CKE/SKE proposals in an Australian and international context and sets the proposal against the more general debate on cryptography, its technology and usage, and public policy. A likely scenario is suggested for Australia involving the incorporation of backup and recovery and network directory services into the encryption scheme and the use of Australia Post, and indeed any national post office structure, as an ideal candidate for trials of both the technology and public/business acceptance of this overall structure.

Mobile networked computing is raising important information security and privacy issues. This paper is concerned with the design of authentication protocols for a mobile computing environment. The paper first analyses the authentication initiator protocols proposed by Belier, Chang and Yacobi (BCY) and the modifications considered by Carlsen and points out some weaknesses. The paper then suggests improvements to these protocols. The paper proposes secure end-to-end protocols between mobile users using both symmetric and public key based systems. These protocols enable mutual authentication and establish a shared secret key between mobile users. Furthermore, these protocols provide a certain degree of anonymity of the communicating users to be achieved vis-a-vis other system users. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1996.","","Authentication; Network security; Personal computers; Authentication protocols; End-to-end protocol; Mobile communications; Mobile computing environment; Mutual authentication; Networked computing; Networked environments; Security and privacy issues; Mobile telecommunication systems"

A robust worldwide information security infrastructure must be set up, including a Key Management Infrastructure. However, the unconditional use of encryption by criminals poses a threat to law enforcement. Consequently, governments have two tasks. The first is stimulating the establishment of a security infrastructure that protects their citizens, but which does not facilitate criminals to shield their activities from law-enforcement agencies. The second task is coping with the use of encryption by criminals in general - outside of this infrastructure. In this article, Eric Verheul, Bert-Jaap Koops and Henk van Tilborg address the first task. The authors review several (technical) proposals and a few government initiatives, focusing on key-escrow proposals. They present a series of criteria that acceptable solutions should meet, and note that all proposals so far fail to meet many of these criteria. The establishment of a worldwide security infrastructure cannot be achieved without strong cooperation of governments. In fact, the authors argue, governments themselves should take up the challenge of establishing a security infrastructure based on public-key encryption, which does not hamper law enforcement. The authors offer a new solution to achieve this, ""binding data"", which improves upon current proposals. It helps the establishment of a strong security infrastructure in which (unilateral) fraud (i.e. not complying with the agreed rules) for criminal or subversive purposes is discouraged; such abuse is difficult and detectible by arbitrary parties. The proposal allows a straightforward monitoring of compliance with law-enforcement regulations, without users having to deposit keys beforehand. This security infrastructure does not solve criminal encryption use outside of this framework - it is not meant to. Criminals can use encryption anyhow; they should only be kept from gaining advantage in using the government infrastructure for this. The authors envision how a security infrastructure can be established that is flexible enough to be incorporated in any national crypto policy, on both the domestic and international use of cryptography.","",""

In contrast with most encryption algorithms, the proposed method is mathematically irreversible in response to the requirement of the French National Commission of Computerized Information Security which demands that the cryptosystem must not be decipherable even by the legitimate recipient. In order to prevent deciphering by frequency analysis, the proposed method introduces polynomial operations so that neither indication concerning the length of the string nor a possible repetition of characters can be obtained by code disclosure. The security of the system is reinforced by the use of two keys, the first one to be defined by the producers of information and the second one by the recipient so that nobody can decrypt the enciphered text. © 1996 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.","Anonymity; Confidentiality; Epidemiological survey; Linkage of records; Non-reversible encryption",""

This paper establishes that the staff culture of the organization is of particular importance in determining the level and types of security that will be accepted. This culture will be based upon staff awareness of and attitudes towards security and it is, therefore, important to have a clear idea of what these attitudes are. To this end, two surveys have been conducted within a reference environment to establish the attitudes of general users and technical staff, allowing the results to be fed back to HCE management to enable security policy to be appropriately defined. These results indicated that, although the establishment had participated in a European healthcare security initiative, staff attitudes and awareness were still weak in some areas.","Attitudes; Security; Staff culture; Surrey","article; attitude; awareness; finance; health care management; health care organization; health care system; human; information system; medical information; medical staff; practice guideline; standard"

They are the primary building blocks for any information security effort. In order to successfully install security in Information Systems operating in European Health Care Establishments (HCEs), a set of principles and guidelines must exist, which establishes both direction and management support. A HLSP should be used as a reference for a wide variety of information security and privacy activities which include establishment of user access privileges, performing risk analyses, conducting investigation of security and privacy threats, etc. It should also be considered as an essential part of the overall information policy of every HCE, which helps integrating the procedural aspects within the administrative organisation in the HCE. A HLSP refers primarily to two main actors, namely the acting subjects (patients, physicians, health informaticians, administrators, health care authorities, insurance companies, etc.) and the data objects that should be protected (medical records, communication data, etc.). The High Level Security Policy proposed herein should be fully adopted in order to be effective; moreover, conformance to its provisions should be made mandatory for all members of staff; special approval should be required when a HCE staff member wishes to take a course of action divergent from policy rules. It is worth noticing that even when a High Level Security Policy already exists, it is advisable to the management of the Health Care Establishment to periodically revisit it to see whether it should be modified or augmented. Security in Health Care Automated Information Systems can be conceptually viewed at four distinct levels of abstraction, namely generic principles (society and culture dependent); principles (administration dependent); guidelines (technology dependent) and measures (installation dependent). HLSPs address the two middle levels of abstraction, namely principles and guidelines. Hence, HLSPs depend on generic principles and must be complemented by measures. The HLSP, as it stands, defines the general approach that a Health Care Establishment should have towards implementing security. In other words, it states what should be done in order to implement security efficiently; it does not provide technical details on how to do this. These details can be found in the specialised technical guidelines developed within SEISMED. No formalised security levels have been considered in this document. Rather, the High Level Security Policy herein provides a set of mandatory conditions to ensure adequate security of personal information processed by Health Information Systems. The HLSP proposed herein was developed by a top-down approach. Specifically, principles were first derived as a result of: √ consulting, analysing and adapting relevant similar efforts of international bodies, including - inter alia - the CEC (Directives 287 and 288), the Council of Europe, the Organisation of Economical Co-operation and Development (OECD), the US Department of Health Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook, etc. √ considering what the functional model of a 'secure' HCE should be. Secondly, guidelines were developed, by detailing principles. The end result is a set of nine principles and eighty seven guidelines. The HLSP was developed in three phases. The first phase aimed at providing the reference centres with an initial draft of the HLSP, based on: √ the results of an attitude survey among Health Care professionals in Europe; √ the results of Risk Analysis exercises conducted at the four hospitals acting as reference centres; √ the results of the analysis of existing and emerging data protection legislation throughout Europe; √ relevant international literature. The second phase consisted of the evaluation of the draft HLSP produced by the first phase by Health Care professionals, Health Informaticians and management. The third phase consisted of the evaluation of the draft HLSP by all SEISMED partners and resulted in the current document. The end result is a compromise between several different (but mostly fundamentally convergent) opinions expressed by project participants or external experts; nevertheless it is felt that this has not led into major internal inconsistencies or contradictions. It is also felt that the HLSP should undergo a further, lengthy period of implementation in several HCEs across Europe, so it can be verified, amended, or modified according to everyday practice. © 1996 The Authors.","","Abstracting; Felt; Health care; Health insurance; Health risks; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Laws and legislation; Medical computing; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Security systems; Automated information; Department of healths; Health care professionals; Health information systems; Levels of abstraction; Personal information; Project participants; Technical guidelines; Security of data"

In order to prevent an adversary from inferring classified information from combinations of unclassified information, a database inference analyst must be able to detect and prevent possible inferences. Detecting database inference problems at database design time provides great power in reducing problems over the lifetime of a database. We have developed and constructed a system called Wizard to analyze databases for their inference problems. The system takes as input a database schema, its constituent instances (if available) and additional human-supplied domain information, and provides a set of associations between entities and/or activities that can be grouped by their potential severity of inference vulnerability. A knowledge acquisition process called microanalysis permits semantic knowledge of a database to be incorporated into the analysis using conceptual graphs. These graphs are then analyzed with respect to inference-relevant domains we call facets using tools we have developed. We can determine inference problems within single facets as well as some inference problems between two or more facets. The architecture of the system is meant to be general so that further refinements of inference information subdomains can be easily incorporated into the system. ©1996 IEEE.","Conceptual graphs; Database inference; Inference analysis; Inference detection; Information security; Transitive associations","Computational linguistics; Computer architecture; Data acquisition; Inference engines; Security of data; Conceptual graphs; Database inference analysis and detection system; Transitive associations; Database systems"

Demands from the French department for computerized information security (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés: CNIL), in regard to abiding by the law of January 6, 1978, completed by the law of July 1st, 1994 on nominal data processing in the framework of medical research have to be taken into account. Notably, the CNIL advised to render anonymous patient identities before the extraction of each establishment file. This paper describes a recently implemented protocol, registered with the French department for computerized information security (Service Central de la Sécurité des Systèmes d'information : SCSSI) whose purpose is to render anonymous medical files in view of their extraction. Once rendered anonymous, these files will be exportable so as to be merged with other files and used in a framework of epidemiological studies. Therefore, this protocol uses the Standard Hash Algorithm (SHA) which allows the replacement of identities by their imprints while ensuring a minimal collision rate in order to allow a correct linkage of the different information concerning the same patient. A first evaluation of the extraction and anonymity software with regard to the purpose of an epidemiological survey is described here.

It has been marked by a high level of controversy over algorithms, patent rights and escrow policy. The diverse needs of the government and commercial sectors have led to mutually exclusive solutions based on different algorithms and policy; this phenomenon is fairly unique to the United States. Because of the strong requirement to preserve the differences that make these solutions unique for the two environments, the near-term evolution of a single standard appears unlikely. Furthermore, the need on the part of some government agencies and some commercial establishments exists to operate in both environments.

ISO had proposed five security service groups including, confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, non-repudiation, and access control. Cryptography can support implementation of all these security services, by using various cryptographic techniques, which include among other things conventional secret key algorithms, public-key algorithms, authentication procedures, and different digital signature schemes. Hash functions, in cryptography, are used for digital signature applications and authentication procedures. It is advisable, for cryptographic reasons, to sign only hashed messages. A secure hash function must be a one-way and collision-free function. Cryptographic security of hash functions could be evaluated, so far, either by conducting detailed cryptanalysis, or by using computational complexity theory. Each of these methods has its own shortcomings. In this paper, a new scheme for evaluating the cryptographic security of hash functions is proposed. The proposed scheme is simple, fast, and based on solid mathematical model offered by Markov process. Then the proposed scheme is used to evaluate the cryptographic security of the Message Digest MD-4 algorithm. Results came in accordance with what was conjectured and published.","","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Cryptography; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Authentication procedures; Data integrity; Digital signature; Hash functions; Security of data"

There are many challenges, and success is determined by the establishment of a solid and firm baseline security architecture that accommodate today's external connectivity requirements, provides transitional solutions that integrate with evolving and dynamic technologies, and ultimately acknowledges both the strategic and tactical goals of an evolving network security architecture and firewall system. This paper explores the evolution of external network connectivity requirements, the associated challenges and the subsequent development and evolution of firewall security systems. It makes the assumption that a firewall is a set of integrated and interoperable components, coming together to form a `SYSTEM' and must be designed, implement and managed as such.

In many ways the security requirements in health care environments are fundamentally different from other domains and hence many aspects of existing standards were considered inappropriate. The problem has been addressed by the development of information security guidelines specifically targeting the health care community. A comprehensive set of baseline security recommendations have been developed for use by all HCEs within Europe, representing a minimal acceptable standard for the security of operational health information systems and their associated environments. The guidelines are intended to provide a straightforward means of identifying security weaknesses and validating existing systems to ensure compliance. The guidelines were developed in close consultation with the medical community, with input from both the SEISMED Reference Centres and other independent health care professionals. The guidelines are grouped under ten key principles of protection, which are considered to represent the main areas that must be considered in securing existing systems. Coverage includes policy and administration issues, physical and environmental protection, personnel security procedures and logical I system security controls. The guidelines are relevant to and will affect all categories of HCE personnel. However, certain issues are not appropriate to all staff and, therefore, three separate sets of guidelines are available, each focusing on different classes of HCE personnel. • General guidelines are available for day-to-day reference by the majority of HCE staff (including clinicians, administrators and general system users). • Management guidelines target those responsible for determining HCE security policy and also serve to explain the need for a number of more technically based measures. • IT & Security Personnel guidelines present the most detailed information relating to the implementation and validation of security and address personnel such as IT staff and system administrators. These documents provide extensive information on what aspects of security should be considered, with appropriate guidelines in each case, as well as general suggestions on implementation. It is envisaged that the guidelines may be used as either a detailed source of reference during the introduction of security or, alternatively, as a simple means of validating existing arrangements. © 1996 The Authors.","","Health care; Information use; Medical computing; Personnel; Security of data; Security systems; Deliberate threats; Health care professionals; Health information systems; Health-care system; Security personnel; Security procedures; Security requirements; System administrators; Medical information systems"

The sometimes heated and wide ranging debate concerning cryptographic policy, content controls, commerce, and interoperability on the Internet tends to divert attention away from the need for a reasoned assessment and understanding of the true dynamics of nurturing a diverse global marketplace on the Internet. Lost in the contentious debate is a principle we feel is particularly important given the nature of information technology: that a policy consistent with user requirements and market acceptance provides economic benefits. In some cases, the 'economic pie' can be expanded-or shrunk-by corporate or government actions, inevitably affecting all. We argue that information security is compromised if federal policies and corporate initiatives ignore user requirements and the basic principles of Internet economics. This in turn may limit market acceptance of new research, services, applications, and technologies. For example, unintended results from ill-formed federal laws may severely limit economic benefits gained from billions of dollars of federally sponsored research that created and sustained the Internet. Furthermore, in the guise of enhanced security and advanced features, proprietary systems and partitioned markets lead to a lack of interoperability that further compromises prospects for society to realize the aforementioned benefits. Many of these problems can be avoided by an open policymaking process that is informed by collaborative research and development activities. It would be ironic indeed if the set of federal policies that founded and sustained the precursors of the evolving electronic marketplace centered on the Internet forced those new opportunities offshore. Aside from affecting the balance of trade, jobs and opportunities for further innovation will possibly be lost to overseas competitors. Specifically, the information security policies of the Cold War era, which provided much of the motivation for the critical federal research and development support of the Internet and its predecessors, the NSFnet and ARPANET, threaten to cripple the development of commercially acceptable levels of security for electronic marketplace transactions. These issues are discussed in this paper, by drawing on recent events and the Commerce and Information Security session of March 9-10, 1995; part of an NSF and ARPA- sponsored workshop on Internet Economics held at MIT. An intensified dialog among industry, academia, government, and the public on information security and electronic commerce issues is clearly needed. Our research shows that these issues are critical to establishing and maintaining U.S. leadership in the Age of Information.","",""

Apparently, although security measures in the mainframe environment have been well implemented relative to their perceived threat, the same cannot be said about the client/server environment. Certain critical areas in the client/server environment in which security exposure is likely are discussed.

In that sense, a cryptographic algorithm or protocol is simply a mechanism to transfer trust from where it exists to where it is needed. This paper puts the focus on trust itself and shows that it is a very complex concept with many interesting and important implications. We do not attempt to define a formal trust model, but rather examine the types of trust and trust relationships which are relevant for information security. It is shown that the existence of trust as a phenomenon depends on the existence of malicious behaviour. This observation leads to the distinction between passionate entities with human-like capabilities, and rational entities which basically are systems. Trust can then be defined as the belief that a rational entity will resist malicious manipulation or that a passionate entity will behave without malicious intent. It is also shown that trust relationships exhibit a great diversity, that they are based on knowledge and that they contain aspects in common with strategy games.","","Security of data; Cryptographic algorithms; Distributed systems; Human like; Strategy games; Trust modeling; Trust relationship; Network security"

In clinical studies, the incidence of preoperative anxiety has varied widely, from 11 to 80%, depending on the methods used to assess it. Because there appears to be a relationship between high preoperative level of anxiety and greater surgical risk, attempts to measure and relieve presurgical anxiety seem to be of clinical significance. There are several problems with the designs and methods used in past and more recent studies of premedication. Many of the recent results were produced from studies that used a variety of more or less validated assessments, yielding variable results in different centres which can seldom be compared with each other. More accurate and generally accepted but simple assessments are needed to study the anxiolytic effect of different premedicants. Benzodiazepines are the most popular preoperative agents because their anxiolytic effect is associated with high patient acceptance and they are devoid of significant adverse effects. However, great interindividual variation in response does occur. It is likely that new methods of administering benzodiazepines (such as by intranasal, transmucosal and rectal routes) could increase the utility of these agents. The preoperative anxiolytic effect of antipsychotics, antihistamines and barbiturates is questionable, but some opioids and especially α2 receptor agonists appear to have this property. However, clinically significant unwanted effects may prevent the routine use of the latter 2 drug groups. It should be noted that all patients do not automatically require pharmacological premedication. Good preoperative information, assurance and a positive attitude of hospital personnel may be the best treatment for preoperative anxiety in some cases.","","alimemazine; alpha adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; antihistaminic agent; barbituric acid derivative; benzodiazepine; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; diazepam; flunitrazepam; hydroxyzine; morphine; neuroleptic agent; opiate; oxazepam; oxycodone; phenobarbital; triazolam; anxiety; human; priority journal; review; surgery"

Today's global `Infosphere' presents us with a networked environment that knows no geographical, national, or temporal boundaries, and no ownership, laws, or identity cards. This seamless aggregation of computers, networks, databases, applications, and the like store, transmit, and process information. This information is now recognized as an asset to governments, corporations, and individuals alike. This information must be protected from misuse. The Security Profile Inspector (SPI) performs static analyses of Unix-based clients and servers to check on their security configuration. SPI's broad range of security tests and flexible usage options support the needs of novice and expert system administrators alike. SPI's use within the Department of Energy and Department of Defense has resulted in more secure systems, less vulnerable to hostile intentions. Host-based information protection techniques and tools must also be supported by network-based capabilities. Our experience shows that a weak link in a network of clients and servers presents itself sooner or later, and can be more readily identified by dynamic intrusion detection techniques and tools. The Network Intrusion Detector (NID) is one such tool. NID is designed to monitor and analyze activity on the Ethernet broadcast Local Area Network segment and product transcripts of suspicious user connections. NID's retrospective and real-time modes have proven invaluable to security officers faced with ongoing attacks to their systems and networks.","","Data communication systems; Local area networks; Security systems; Telecommunication networks; UNIX; Ethernet; Information security; Network intrusion detector; Security profile inspector; Security of data"

They are the primary building blocks for any information security effort. In order to successfully install security in Information Systems operating in European Health Care Establishments (HCEs), a set of principles and guidelines must exist, which establishes both direction and management support. A HLSP should be used as a reference for a wide variety of information security and privacy activities which include establishment of user access privileges, performing risk analyses, conducting investigation of security and privacy threats, etc. It should also be considered as an essential part of the overall information policy of every HCE, which helps integrating the procedural aspects within the administrative organisation in the HCE. A HLSP refers primarily to two main actors, namely the acting subjects (patients, physicians, health informaticians, administrators, health care authorities, insurance companies, etc.) and the data objects that should be protected (medical records, communication data, etc.). The High Level Security Policy proposed herein should be fully adopted in order to be effective; moreover, conformance to its provisions should be made mandatory for all members of staff; special approval should be required when a HCE staff member wishes to take a course of action divergent from policy rules. It is worth noticing that even when a High Level Security Policy already exists, it is advisable to the management of the Health Care Establishment to periodically revisit it to see whether it should be modified or augmented. Security in Health Care Automated Information Systems can be conceptually viewed at four distinct levels of abstraction, namely generic principles (society and culture dependent); principles (administration dependent); guidelines (technology dependent) and measures (installation dependent). HLSPs address the two middle levels of abstraction, namely principles and guidelines. Hence, HLSPs depend on generic principles and must be complemented by measures. The HLSP, as it stands, defines the general approach that a Health Care Establishment should have towards implementing security. In other words, it states what should be done in order to implement security efficiently; it does not provide technical details on how to do this. These details can be found in the specialised technical guidelines developed within SEISMED. No formalised security levels have been considered in this document. Rather, the High Level Security Policy herein provides a set of mandatory conditions to ensure adequate security of personal information processed by Health Information Systems. The HLSP proposed herein was developed by a top-down approach. Specifically, principles were first derived as a result of consulting, analysing and adapting relevant similar efforts of international bodies, including - inter alia - the CEC (Directives 287 and 288), the Council of Europe, the Organisation of Economical Co-operation and Development (OECD), the US Department of Health Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook, etc. considering what the functional model of a 'secure' HCE should be. Secondly, guidelines were developed, by detailing principles. The end result is a set of nine principles and eighty seven guidelines. The HLSP was developed in three phases. The first phase aimed at providing the reference centres with an initial draft of the HLSP, based on the results of an attitude survey among Health Care professionals in Europe the results of Risk Analysis exercises conducted at the four hospitals acting as reference centres the results of the analysis of existing and emerging data protection legislation throughout Europe relevant international literature. The second phase consisted of the evaluation of the draft HLSP produced by the first phase by Health Care professionals, Health Informaticians and management. The third phase consisted of the evaluation of the draft HLSP by all SEISMED partners and resulted in the current document. The end result is a compromise between several different (but mostly fundamentally convergent) opinions expressed by project participants or external experts; nevertheless it is felt that this has not led into major internal inconsistencies or contradictions. It is also felt that the HLSP should undergo a further, lengthy period of implementation in several HCEs across Europe, so it can be verified, amended, or modified according to everyday practice.","","Abstracting; Felt; Health care; Health insurance; Health risks; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Laws and legislation; Medical computing; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Security systems; Automated information; Department of healths; Health care professionals; Health information systems; Levels of abstraction; Personal information; Project participants; Technical guidelines; Security of data"

The development and use of computerised systems must be controlled through compliance with standards and procedures for information security, enforced through national legislation and professional codes of conduct, if serious abuse of the data is to be avoided. Health care professionals cannot be expected to acquire working knowledge of how information systems are made secure since this is a technical and highly complex subject. However, it is essential that health care professionals understand why it is important to maintain a secure environment for the records they keep about patients and their care and how this can be organised. This is best achieved through a well structured educational programme involving all trainee and qualified health care staff, a task which should be coordinated by the national professional bodies. A management structure is needed within health care facilities that recognises the responsibility of health care professionals to keep the health care data relating to their patients secure. An arrangement is proposed that gives the most senior clinician in a health care facility the ultimate responsibility for security of health care data held in the organisation. Where appropriate, this would be delegated to a senior clinician with training and experience in information systems and their security. This 'information doctor' would, with the assistance of computer experts and health care managers, implement and monitor the organisation's information security strategy. Contracts should be developed between health care facilities and their patients, defining the limits to the use and disclosure of personal health data. Similar contracts with external agencies should also stipulate the minimum level of security to be applied to health records shared between the organisations. © 1996, The SEISMED Consortium.","","Computer Security; Confidentiality; Ethics, Professional; Europe; Humans; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Security Measures; Health care; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Philosophical aspects; Professional aspects; Regulatory compliance; Security of data; Computerised systems; Electronic healthcare; Ethical implications; Health care professionals; Healthcare facility; Management structure; National legislation; Personal health datum; computer security; confidentiality; education; Europe; human; legal aspect; medical ethics; medical record; organization and management; review; standard; Medical computing"

Home interviews were conducted with mothers and their pediatricians were surveyed. Two hundred mothers with at least one child age 2-3 years who see one of five pediatricians in a staff model health maintenance organization were asked to participate. Mothers' and pediatricians' goals in the following seven areas of health supervision were assessed: biomedical, development, behavior, family functioning, safety education, and interpersonal and system interaction. Mothers stated physicians were their main source of parenting information. Assurance of physical health and normal development were more important than discussion of behavioral, family, or safety issues. Mothers of low SES were more likely to feel that physical aspects of health should be the focus and were less interested in psychosocial issues. Physicians stressed interpersonal, safety, and behavioral goals more than mothers. Individual physician responses did not predict the responses of mothers in their practice. Our data suggest either that mothers do not feel that psychosocial and safety issues are the highest priorities in health supervision or that physicians are not effectively reaching mothers on these issues.","","article; child health care; female; human; medical practice; mother; normal human; safety; social psychology; treatment outcome"

Similarly, smartcard holders can be considered mobile users as they access the network at various points. Such mobile processing can be employed in large scale census applications in statistics gathering, in surveys and tallying, in reading and collecting local control information, etc. This distributed computing paradigm where local pieces of data are getting accumulated in a mobile unit presents new information security challenges. Here, we point at some problems it poses and suggest solutions. The basic problem considered involves the design of a mobile agent that is capable of traversing an untrusted (curious) network while gathering and securing data from the nodes that it visits. We assume that some subset of the nodes may collaborate to track the agent, and we assume that snapshots of memory are taken at each node at times that are unpredictable to the agent. The data that is gathered must be securely stored within the agent and the adversarial nodes must remain oblivious to what is taken by the agent. In addition, the agent’s movement throughout the network should be made difficult to trace. Furthermore, we assume that the agent is limited in storage capacity. To prevent the nodes from getting decryption capability, the agent must carry a public key for (asymmetric) encryption. We present an economical solution that we call “sliding encryption≓. This is a new mode of operation of public key cryptosystems that allows the encryption of small amounts of plaintext yielding small amounts of ciphertext. Furthermore, the encryption is performed so that it is intractable to recover the plaintext without the appropriate private key. We also describe how to modify sliding encryption so that the resulting ciphertexts are hard to correlate, thus making it possible to have mobile agents that are not easy to trace. Sliding encryption is applicable to mobile agent technology and may have independent applications to “storage-limited technology≓ such as smartcards and mobile units. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.","Applets; Cryptoviruses; Mobile computing; Mode of operation; Network computing; Network software agents; Public key; RSA; Sliding encryption; Smartcards; Space-efficient encryption; Spiders; Viruses; Worms; WWW","Computer viruses; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Mobile computing; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Smart cards; Surveys; Viruses; World Wide Web; Applets; Cryptoviruses; Mode of operations; Network computing; Public keys; Space efficient; Spiders; Worms; Mobile agents"

Timely availability of patient information is critical to patient care. In the form of a report, image or both, information is the final product of every imaging department. Internet applications can allow physicians easy access to and review of patient information. Many imaging departments already have the basic components of Internet technology in place, which may include an existing image distribution network. At the University of Kansas Medical Center (UKMC), we had a good network base and digital digitation and distribution system, but had not found an appropriate PACS for image distribution and display. When a home page was designed for the radiology department at UKMC, it was intended for report distribution. However, we quickly discovered that it could also function as a low-cost/low-resolution image distribution system. Before making confidential patient information accessible on the Internet, appropriate information security requirements must be in place. At UKMC, access is strictly controlled through the medical records department. Programmers in the radiology department at UKMC are also using the Internet to develop applications for on-line review, editing and electronic signature. Early experience with the Internet as a basis for radiology image and report distribution has been extremely successful and popular with referring physicians at UKMC.","","Academic Medical Centers; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Security; Computer Systems; Confidentiality; Hospital Distribution Systems; Humans; Interdepartmental Relations; Kansas; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Models, Organizational; Radiology Department, Hospital; Radiology Information Systems; article; computer network; computer security; computer system; confidentiality; hospital information system; hospital management; human; medical record; nonbiological model; organization and management; public relations; radiology department; United States; university hospital"

Quality would be enhanced by ensuring that all EHCRS contained a standard core functionality and were compliant with basic structural requirements. To get a comprehensive list of requirements to ensure that EHCRS with IT support for nursing activities serve as an aid to the process of care it is essential that nurses get directly involved in the process of defining the requirements.

It is shown that these techniques also have substantial potential within the field of computer security and specifically within the field of risk analysis. Risk analysis is a complex task that entails the consideration of many parameters which are, more often than not, very difficult to quantify. Fuzzy logic presents a natural way of modelling these vaguenesses, while also ensuring that human creativity and intuitivity, which is an essential ingredient for successful risk analysis, remains present. The ability of a fuzzy system to explain its reasoning process is shown to have definite applicability within the field of risk analysis. Limitations in current risk analysis techniques are discussed, whereafter it is shown that fuzzy logic modelling techniques exhibit substantial potential in addressing these limitations.

All these processes, however, require that the right information be made available to the right person or persons at the right place and at the right time. Costly lessons learnt with regard to information security controls introduced over the past number of years made it abundantly clear that it was vital, especially in a commercial environment, circumspectly and discreetly to apply countermeasures for the protection of information. A widely used mechanism with which to determine appropriate and effective countermeasures for the protection of information is to classify the said information. Most modern organizations classify their transaction-based data, for example3, that information generated by orders and invoices, for the purposes of access control. The question that arises, however, is this: How many organizations classify their written communication, i.e. that contained in documents? All the information contained in documents represents the transaction-based data of an organization, and has a far more critical impact on its profitability than any other security factor. This paper has as its object the laying down of guidelines for the security classification of such documents. Documents are, by definition, mostly used as vehicles for the exchange of information not only within, but also between and among organizations. Important fundamentals on which this paper is based are as follows: the security requirements of specific categories of documents, the various processing stages of documents, such as draft and final, and the contents and structure of documents. In addition, the concept of information capability will be introduced. (The term ""information capability"" imports the ""amount"" of information added to the data already contained in a document by means of the structural properties of that document.) The model that will be devised on the strength of this paper will promote the consistent classification of documents and is intended for integration with commercial software products that command document processing capabilities, for example, document management systems and groupware.","Access control; Document security; Object classification",""

They are the primary building blocks for any information security effort. In order to successfully install security in Information Systems operating in European Health Care Establishments (HCEs), a set of principles and guidelines must exist, which establishes both direction and management support. A HLSP should be used as a reference for a wide variety of information security and privacy activities which include establishment of user access privileges, performing risk analyses, conducting investigation of security and privacy threats, etc. It should also be considered as an essential part of the overall information policy of every HCE, which helps integrating the procedural aspects within the administrative organisation in the HCE. A HLSP refers primarily to two main actors, namely the acting subjects (patients, physicians, health informaticians, administrators, health care authorities, insurance companies, etc.) and the data objects that should be protected (medical records, communication data, etc.). The High Level Security Policy proposed herein should be fully adopted in order to be effective; moreover, conformance to its provisions should be made mandatory for all members of staff; special approval should be required when a HCE staff member wishes to take a course of action divergent from policy rules. It is worth noticing that even when a High Level Security Policy already exists, it is advisable to the management of the Health Care Establishment to periodically revisit it to see whether it should be modified or augmented. Security in Health Care Automated Information Systems can be conceptually viewed at four distinct levels of abstraction, namely generic principles (society and culture dependent); principles (administration dependent); guidelines (technology dependent) and measures (installation dependent). HLSPs address the two middle levels of abstraction, namely principles and guidelines. Hence, HLSPs depend on generic principles and must be complemented by measures. The HLSP, as it stands, defines the general approach that a Health Care Establishment should have towards implementing security. In other words, it states what should be done in order to implement security efficiently; it does not provide technical details on how to do this. These details can be found in the specialised technical guidelines developed within SEISMED. No formalised security levels have been considered in this document. Rather, the High Level Security Policy herein provides a set of mandatory conditions to ensure adequate security of personal information processed by Health Information Systems. The HLSP proposed herein was developed by a top-down approach. Specifically, principles were first derived as a result of: √ consulting, analysing and adapting relevant similar efforts of international bodies, including - inter alia - the CEC (Directives 287 and 288), the Council of Europe, the Organisation of Economical Co-operation and Development (DECD), the US Department of Health Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook, etc. √ considering what the functional model of a 'secure' HCE should be. Secondly, guidelines were developed, by detailing principles. The end result is a set of nine principles and eighty seven guidelines. The HLSP was developed in three phases. The first phase aimed at providing the reference centres with an initial draft of the HLSP, based on: √ the results of an attitude survey among Health Care professionals in Europe; √ the results of Risk Analysis exercises conducted at the four hospitals acting as reference centres; √ the results of the analysis of existing and emerging data protection legislation throughout Europe; √ relevant international literature. The second phase consisted of the evaluation of the draft HLSP produced by the first phase by Health Care professionals, Health Informaticians and management. The third phase consisted of the evaluation of the draft HLSP by all SEISMED partners and resulted in the current document. The end result is a compromise between several different (but mostly fundamentally convergent) opinions expressed by project participants or external experts; nevertheless it is felt that this has not led into major internal inconsistencies or contradictions. It is also felt that the HLSP should undergo a further, lengthy period of implementation in several HCEs across Europe, so it can be verified, amended, or modified according to everyday practice. © 1996 The Authors.","","Abstracting; Felt; Health care; Health insurance; Health risks; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Laws and legislation; Medical computing; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Security systems; Automated information; Department of healths; Health care professionals; Health information systems; Levels of abstraction; Personal information; Project participants; Technical guidelines; Security of data"

A wide range of data protection and information security measures will need to be taken to ensure the quality and integrity of such records. A European Union directive was formally adopted in 1995 which sets the obligations of those responsible for data processing as well as a number of important rights for individuals. The responsible teleconsultant or medical officer, as the data controller, must make sure these measures are enforced. In the case of the transmission of medical records to another location, the original data controller may remain liable for abuses. But as different elements of the records are spread throughout the different departments of a hospital or across different geographical locations, it may become difficult to ascertain who is responsible for protecting and controlling what. To this end, the designation of liability by contractual means, between the hospitals and remote users of a telemedicine network, would be the clearest and most straightforward way of achieving uniformity and predictability in terms of the distribution of responsibility for data protection and security. © 1998, Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited.

Organizations attempt to secure their own IT environment, but they have little control over the IT systems they link with. If those external IT environments are insecure, they might pose a threat to the IT systems in the host environment.

As this occurs, the demand for embeddable security features into new and diverse products, including commercial products, will increase. In addition, increasingly limited resources at the National Security Agency (NSA) will result in fewer DoD approvals. An effective method of addressing these conflicting trends is to develop a highly transportable and hierarchical INFOSEC architecture. To be successful, an autonomous subsystem would be required which meets the DoD/NSA current and future standards. Harris has made a long term R and D investment into developing such an architecture, internally called the Common INFOSEC Module (CIM). The CIM architecture addresses the need for a National Security Agency (NsA) endorsed, embeddable technology that can be tailored to communications platforms to provide Type 1 Communications and Transmission Security (COMSEC and TRANSEC), along with advanced key management. In addition, CIM accommodates cryptographic solutions that support NATO interoperability, Sensitive but Unclassified requirements, and selected export requirements.

It focusses on the problem that in order to meet these challenges operating systems must be capable of supporting a multitude of information domains, each domain defined by its own and individual security policy. In such multi-domain systems, the interoperability between different information domains constitutes a major problem. While the security policies of the system control the interactions within their domains, it is an unsolved problem how interactions between different domains can be made secure. In order to provide a precise foundation for the discussion of secure interdomain actions as well as for the development of concepts for their implementation, the paper proposes a classification of interdomain actions that clearly identifies two major types of interdomain actions: interactions that cause conflicts between the involved security policies and interactions for which none of the involved policies can provide any security rule. The paper concludes that in order to support multiple information domains, operating systems must be capable of classifying interdomain actions, and they must support new types of interdomain security policies that mediate security conflicts in interdomain actions and complete the set of security rules for interdomain actions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the computational complexity of interdomain action classification.","",""

Most organizations only realize this dependency, and the exact nature of their vulnerability, once the telematics systems are in place. This often results in the ad hoc addition of safeguards, which causes operational problems. The most important cause of this phenomenon is the fact that information security requirements were never an issue during the design of most systems. In this paper we propose that requirements for information security should be integrated in the design process in an early phase. The benefit of this is that information security will become an integral part of the system. We present an approach that addresses the issue of security requirements in all stages of the design process. For each stage we discuss how these information security requirements can be embedded in that stage.","Design model; Problem-solving; Requirements; System design; Telematics systems","File organization; Mathematical models; Problem solving; Systems analysis; Information security; Telematics systems; Security of data"

By integrating an Information System Security Engineering (ISSE) process into system development or system enhancement activities, system developers can satisfy user concerns. An ISSE process will identify the quality of security services needed by users; help identify security mechanisms to satisfy user needs; lead to an effective security design; identify the quality of security services offered by the actual system; and develop the documentation necessary to effectively market the security services offered by a system. An effective and cost efficient method for managing and providing discipline for the ISSE process is for system developers to use an automated system engineering tool. Such a tool significantly enhances the system security engineering team's ability to satisfy user security needs throughout the system design process.","","Computer aided software engineering; Computer systems programming; Information services; Security of data; Automated information systems; Information system security engineering (ISSE); Management information systems"

Ironically, the disciplines that assess, evaluate, and solve human based problems have not been an integral part of the information security measures used to protect data. The methodology of profiling has been used for two decades now to assist investigators and forensic analysts in criminal investigation. Profilers and forensic scientists have joined forces to enhance and expand the tool box used to investigate violent crimes.

Additionally, the motivations for war are different in the cyber environment. The focus is not one of territorial acquisition, but one of information piracy and information system vandalism. The one exception to this notion is that there are no equivalents to the Conventional Forces Europe Treaty of the United Nations, nor is there international computer crime legislation to reconcile international cyber incidents. Couple this with the fact that, because our networked society is relatively new and evolving, many do not understand information security issues and are not able (or do not understand the need) to protect information and information systems. This creates an opportunity for cyber guerrillas to wreak havoc. What is worse is that even if you can determine who committed the act (not an easy task), there is no recognized mechanism or process for legal retribution.","","Information technology; Security of data; Cyber battlefield; Military operations"

DESIGN: Descriptive, comparative. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a Midwestern hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A nonprobability convenience sample of parents or primary caregivers of critically ill children (n = 21) and pediatric critical care nurses (n = 17). OUTCOME MEASURES: Critical Care Family Needs Inventory modified for pediatrics and demographic questionnaires. RESULTS: Information, assurance, and proximity to the critically ill child were identified as priority needs of the PCGs in this study. Significant differences on specific needs were identified between PCG/nurse matched pairs; however, no significant differences were found in total scores between the two groups by a two-tailed paired t test. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the need to investigate interventions to better address parental needs of critically ill children. By consistent identification, prioritization, and incorporation of parental needs into the plan of care, nurses can assist the parents in the recognition and fulfillment of needs that have less perceived importance. Research-based interventions will facilitate improved parental adaptation to their child's critical hospitalization.","","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Child; Child, Hospitalized; Critical Illness; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units, Pediatric; Male; Nurses; Parents; Pediatric Nursing; Questionnaires; Social Perception; United States; MLCS; MLOWN; adaptive behavior; adult; article; child; child hospitalization; comparative study; critical illness; female; human; intensive care; male; nurse; nursing; parent; pediatric nursing; perception; psychological aspect; questionnaire; United States"

The process was to generate a set of one-way hash values that define the contents of key system files stored on host computers. Periodically, the hashes would be recalculated and compared to the stored original to determine if any change could be detected. Each unexpected result would be investigated to determine if the change was malicious or accidental. Digital signature technologies are being used today in many aspects of information security, including proof of identity, authentication, authorization, integrity and non-repudiation. The combination of Kim and Spafford's early research and the application of digital signatures and smart cards is the basis of this paper. It discusses new techniques that have been developed and evolved from the original approach.

Users are frequently worried that their information will be stolen, and their losses are too much to measured by money if it is important information. Therefore, information security techniques are concerned constantly with issues such as digital signature, authentication and encryption/decryption. In particular, the key distribution scheme of ID-based cryptosystems is a key to the security of information. Shatnir first introduced the concept of an identity-based cryptosystem. In this system, the advantages of the public key scheme is the future of the system. It can produce a unique ID number using a reliable key authentication center (KAC) for each participant. It is also very difficult to attempt to fake another's ID number. However, it has been shown that it is possible for a group of united users try to break the key of the KAC. In this paper, we propose a scheme based on inverse function techniques of number theory; our scheme can prevent united intruders from breaking the KAC key or other users' private keys.","Authentication; Decryption; Encryption; ID-based cryptosystem; Information security; Private key","Computer networks; Inverse problems; Large scale systems; Number theory; Security of data; ID based cryptosystem; Inverse function; Key authentification center; Private keys; Cryptography"

Computer systems such as PACS, telemedicine applications, and medical research networks must protect against accidental or deliberate modification, disclosure, and violation of patient confidentiality in order to be viable. Conventional wisdom in the medical field and among lawmakers legislating the use of electronic medical records suggests that, although it may improve access to information, an electronic medical record cannot be as secure as a traditional paper record. This is not the case. Information security is a well-developed field in the computer and communications industry. If medical information systems, such as PACS, telemedicine applications, and research networks, properly apply information security techniques, they can ensure the accuracy and confidentiality of their patient information and even improve the security of their data over a traditional paper record. This paper will elaborate on some of these techniques and discuss how they can be applied to medical information systems. The following systems will be used as examples for the analysis: A research laboratory at Georgetown University Medical Center, the Deployable Radiology system installed to support the U.S. Army's peace-keeping operation in Bosnia, a kidney dialysis telemedicine system in Washington, DC, and various experiences with implementing and integrating PACS. © 1997 SPIE.","Information security; PACS; Patient confidentiality; Telemedicine","Bioinformatics; Clinical research; Electronic document exchange; Information management; Information use; Management information systems; Medical applications; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Network security; Picture archiving and communication systems; Research laboratories; Security of data; Telemedicine; Communications industry; Electronic medical record; Electronic patient record; Patient confidentiality; Peace-keeping operations; Research environment; Telemedicine application; Telemedicine systems; Medical information systems"

These are well established areas of research and practice in the enforcement of technical information security policies but are not capable of supporting development of comprehensive information security within organizations. Therefore, there is a need to study upper level issues to establish organizational models for specifying security enforcement mechanisms and coordinating policies. This paper proposes a model for dealing with high level information security policies. The core is to enforce a continuous refinement of information security requirements aiming at formally deriving technical security policies from high level security objectives. This refinement is carried out by in formation security harmonization functions. Contribution of this paper is on the specification of a notation for expressing information security requirements and on the specification of a mechanism to formulate harmonization functions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.","","Access control; Cryptography; Specifications; Access control models; Comprehensive information; Cryptographic techniques; High-level information; Information security requirements; Organizational models; Security enforcement mechanisms; Technical information; Security systems"

An optical link is strong depending on the optoelectronic hardware parameters (output optical power, sensitivity, information bandwidth, signal/noise ratio, etc.) and to the topology or to the environment of the applications area (appropriate distances, nodes number, attenuation, hazard measures, etc.) Many laser-links are already fabricated for use in military or in commercial applications. Main advantages are the freedom from licenses, the RFI-EMI immunity, the wide bandwidth and the information security. Main disadvantages are the atmospheric steady and variable attenuation (free air and also rain, snow, fog, smog etc.), the radiation hazards and in some cases the material cost. Based on this know-how we describe in this paper the more important broadcasting parameters of radio-TV-teletext programs with laser beams, starting from the atmospheric transmission influence, continuing with a laser selection guide and with some broadcasting electronic techniques and ending with the proposed modification of a coherent laser-link to a new active receiver system wich fulfill normal or special laser broadcasting options. Possible applications of our study may be the point to multi-point optical communications for local pay TV, the allocation of optical bands for broadcasting, the radii of cellular laser broadcasting, the simulcasting with laser and RF carriers, the implementation of an interactive Radio & TV, etc.. © 1998 SPIE.

This paper describes recent advances in avionics architecture for military aircraft, using the evolving architecture of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) as a specific illustration. Key architectural attributes include effective implementation of open systems principles, hardware and software scaleability to cover a range of applications, independence of specific implementing hardware to minimize parts obsolescence problems, support for information security and trusted computing, and design features that facilitate integration and promote reliable and maintainable systems. A number of tradeoffs must be dealt with in optimizing such designs. These include choice of a fundamental interconnection fabric and interfaces, decisions on centralized vs. Distributed processing, similar decisions on integrated vs. Special purpose sensors and apertures, choices about the real time operating system and applications software, and a number of issues associated with mechanical and electrical design. The architecture must include robust testability features that ensure that the resulting system design can be tested and qualified to the criteria associated with avionics.

Because of the security related questions arising from the proliferation of electronic transfer or storage of sensitive medical data, the US government has begun an effort to set standards concerning levels of medical data sensitivity and to prescribe minimum safeguards for maintaining patient information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), was signed into law as PL 104-191 on September 31, 1996. As the name implies, this law helps ensure that an individual can retain certain health insurance coverage when changing or losing employment. However, it also requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to adopt security standards and establish policies and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to health care information. The legislation further directs that those persons who maintain and transmit health information apply reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of such information and to protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information and unauthorized uses or disclosures...

System effectiveness and cost were used to identify the most valued communication systems and the key system effectiveness and cost trade-offs. System effectiveness measures were developed from basic communication objectives, while cost measures were derived from project cost elements associated with buying a communication system. Existing ADF communication systems formed the baseline for the model. The model highlighted the superior performance of satellite communication (SATCOM) systems over High Frequence (HF) communication systems, and also the significant cost differential in favor of HF systems. However, the final decision involves making a choice between commercial and military satellite communication systems. The choice depends on the decision-maker's information security versus cost. The model can be adapted to the decisionmaker's requirements and can be used to assess any type of command and control communication system.","Decision Analysis; Technology Selection",""

The influence of component code choice is also discussed. It is concluded that correlation, code-division multiple-access (CDMA) and information security (measured by the value of linear complexity) properties of Kronecker sequences are considerably better than those of Combination sequences. Combination sequences cannot be recommended for CDMA use unless the number of active users is few. CDMA performance of Kronecker sequences is almost comparable with that of linear pseudonoise (PN) code families of equal length when a Gold or Kasami code is used as the innermost code and the Barker code is used as the outermost code to guarantee satisfactory correlation and CDMA ' properties. Kronecker sequences possess a considerably higher value of linear complexity than those of the corresponding non-linear Gefle and majority logic type combination sequences. This implies they are highly non-linear codes due to the Kronecker product construction method. It is also observed that the GefTe type Boolean combiner resulted in better correlation ,' and CDMA performance than with majority logic. The use of the purely linear exclusive-or combiner for considerable reduction of code synchronization time is not found recommendable although it results in good CDMA performance.","Codedivision multiple-access; Correlation; Linear complexity; Rapid code synchronization; Spreading codes","Correlation theory; Direct sequence systems; Security of data; Kronecker sequences; Rapid code synchronization; Spreading codes; Code division multiple access"

First, these CAD systems employ parametric curves and surfaces, not polygonal meshes, as their main shape-defining primitives. Second, most CAD applications do not tolerate modifications of model topology and/or geometry that are introduced by existing data embedding algorithms. We propose a new data embedding algorithm for non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curves and surfaces, which employs rational linear reparameterization for embedding messages. The algorithm exactly preserves the shape, that is, the geometry and topology of its embedding targets. Furthermore, it preserves the data size of the model. We consider how these two properties, preservation of shape and preservation of data size, can be significant with regard to the use of data embedding in CAD applications. In addition to the shape- and data size-preserving data embedding algorithm for NURBS curves and surfaces, we outline additional methods for embedding data in various types of parametric curves and surfaces. © 1999 IEEE.","computer-aided design (CAD); digital watermark; information security; reparameterization","Computer graphics; Digital watermarking; Geometry; Interpolation; Security of data; Topology; CAD applications; Curves and surfaces; Data-embedding algorithms; Non-uniform rational B-splines; Nurbs curves and surfaces; Parametric curve; Reparameterization; Shape-preserving; Computer aided design"

Recently, a novel method called Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) has been proposed to attack DES. Under the assumption that the attacker can induce errors into the cipher device, the key of DES can be unveiled easily. The assumed technique is not mature today, but is like to appear in the near future, especially for attacking a tamper resistant device with an embedded DES VLSI chip. In this paper, we proposed a new hardware design for the DES cipher to resist DFA. By adding some protection circuitry, all the unidirectional faults induced into the registers of a DES chip can be detected, and then alter to the cryptosystem immediately. A hardware emulation experiment using Altera's CPLD chip shows the effectiveness of the protection design.","","Computer hardware; Cryptography; VLSI circuits; Differential fault analysis; Computer architecture"

These schemes include using a modular-exponentiation co-processor (firmware implementation). Also being investigated is a method for implementing scaler multiplication over an elliptic curve, which is expected to replace modular exponentiation.

With the exception of discussions into more creative password selection, discussion pertaining to the role of the user, can play in reducing the risk of human error and thus promoting system security has been extremely limited. This lecture will present an overview of information security issues impacted by human interaction that may or may not play a role in promoting system security. Understanding that information systems are in fact composed of hardware and software components which must be addressed using traditional information security protocol, this lecture will provide an understanding of the possible risk that the human/user poses to an information system. Once the risks or factors associated with the human in the security of the system are identified, the next question is do the factors matter? The objective of this lecture is to present an intellectual discussion of human factors issues and their impact on information security.

The process was to generate a set of one-way hash values that define the contents of key system files stored on host computers. Periodically, the hashes would be recalculated and compared to the stored original to determine if any change could be detected. Each unexpected result would be investigated to determine if the change was malicious or accidental. Today, digital signature technologies are being used in many aspects of information security, including proof of identity, authentication, authorization, integrity and non-repudiation.

Over the elliptic curve -on the prime finite field in particular goals - public-key cryptosystems and digital signature schemes frequently use modular inversion if affine coordinates are selected. In the regular computer environment, most data transmission via networks and data storage on memories as well as the operation set of processors are performed in multiples of eight bits or bytes. A fast modular multiplication algorithm that matches these operation units for DSP was proposed to accelerate the Montgomery method by Dusse and Kaliski [2]. However, modular inversion algorithms were developed using bit by bit operation and so do not match the operation unit. This paper proposes two techniques for modular inversion that suits any arbitrary processing unit. The first technique proposes a new extended GCD procedure without any division. It can be constructed by the shifting, adding and multiplying operations, all of which a Montgomery modular arithmetic algorithm employs. The second technique can reduce the delay time of post processing in the modular inversion algorithm. In particular, it is of great use for the modular inversion defined in the Montgomery representation. These proposed techniques make modular inversion about 5.5 times faster.","Binary gcd; Elliptic-curve cryptosystem; Euclidean algorithm; Modular inversion; Montgomery method","Algorithms; Cryptography; Digital signal processing; Fast modular inversion algorithm; Security of data"

Prescriptive models used to recommend improvements to networks usually use reliability or flow as the Measure Of Effectiveness (MOE). Such measures will not give value to efforts that make a network component more difficult to exploit. Similarly, Risk Assessment Models (RAMs) are used to quantify the importance of a component to overall network performance (again measured in terms of reliability or flow) but do not prescribe improvement strategies. This study develops a prescriptive RAM that includes an MOE called invulnerability. This gives value to efforts that make a component more difficult to exploit. Results show that including the vulnerability MOE as a second criterion to complement the reliability MOE allows one to formulate component-hardening strategies. Furthermore, the Pareto-efhcient frontier generated by trading off these two MOEs is very small. This helps to pinpoint specific components that should be improved or hardened for information security. © 1999 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","Information management; Mathematical models; Pareto principle; Reliability; Risk management; Strategic planning; Measure of effectiveness (MOE); Risk assessment models (RAM); Security of data"

Previously, the encodeldecode operations of fiber optic CDMA schemes have been realized by fiber-optic delay lines, planar lightwave circuits (for coherent or incoherent temporal coding schemes)[2,3], spatial light modulators and masks (for spectral or spatial coding schemes)[4,5]. In this paper, a novel hybrid temporaVspectral coding technique based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) for fiber optic CDMA application is proposed and demonstrated experimentally for the first time. Experiment: The experimental setup and configuration of the encodeddecoder are shown in figure 1. In the experiment, the encoder/decoder was constructed by five FBGs with center wavelengths from 15441x11 to 1552nm and spaced 2nm apart. Their bandwidth was about OSnm and reflectivity was over 99.9%. The FBGs were positioned serially along an optical fiber in the pattern of a prime code (1000010000100001000010000)[6] separated by the same distance of 80cm (corresponding to 8ns delay). Thus, the input optical pulses from the laser diode with a mode spacing of OSnm were encoded in a hybrid temporahpectral mode by the encoder into pulse trains as shown in Fig.2. The input signals were modulated by an electro-optic modulator driven by 25Mbit/s data from the pattern generator. The coded signals were then transmitted through 1 lkm dispersion shifted fiber before entering the novel FBG decoder which performed the correlation operation in both temporal and spectral domain. Two decoder configurations were tested in our experiments. The correct decoder was as shown in Fig. 1. The incorrect decoder was identical to the encoder shown in the figure, i.e. it was an end-To-end inversion of the correct decoder. After the correlation operation, the correctly decoded signals were represented by high level pulses without any sidelobes corresponding to each bit ' 1 ' while the incorrectly decoded signals appeared as pseudonoise pulse trains (Fig.3.a). The output eye diagram was shown in Fig.3.b.","","Bragg gratings; Code division multiple access; Codes (symbols); Decoding; Delay circuits; Fiber Bragg gratings; Fiber optics; Fibers; Integrated optics; Light modulation; Light modulators; Light transmission; Modulators; Optical communication; Optical fibers; Security of data; Signal encoding; All-optical processing; Asynchronous transmission; Dispersion shifted fibers; Electro-optic modulators; Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs); Fiber-optic delay lines; Planar light-wave circuits; Spatial light modulators; Optical fiber communication"

This has been accelerated by the availability of affordable memory storage and the proliferation of enterprise networks in use across all types of commercial, governmental, and military organizations today. Previously considered just an infrastructure service, modern telecommunications has become a world-leading industry, a whole spectrum of new technologies, and in an era where ""cyberwarfare"" is a reality it is being viewed now as a weapon system by the military. This evolution has placed renewed importance of configuration information security, as data transmissions and command and control functions (C2) become central operational capabilities in their own right. Applying the advantages offered by geographical information system (GIS) techniques and massive programmable databases, we are ready to take the leap from evolutionary to the revolutionary in terms of data accessibility and situational awareness capabilities. The critical link which many organizations and software developers have been independently working on is how to access multiple, diverse datasets in separate locations across a network and read directly into the GIS application one is using. This is the approach the United States Air Force Space Command at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFE) is taking to implement its new advanced Communications Base Integration System (CBIS). © 2000 IEEE.","Acceleration; Command and control systems; Communication industry; Data communication; Defense industry; Electrical equipment industry; Geographic Information Systems; Information security; Military communication; Weapons","Acceleration; Application programs; Command and control systems; Data communication equipment; Digital storage; Electric machine control; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Military applications; Military aviation; Military communications; Military mapping; Network architecture; Ordnance; Security of data; Command-and-control functions; Communication industry; Data-communication; Defense Industry; Electrical equipment; Infrastructure services; Operational capabilities; Telecommunications infrastructures; Information management"

The buyer does not know where the codeword is embedded and so cannot tamper with it. However a group of dishonest buyers can compare their copies of the object, nd some of the embedded bits and change them to create a pirate copy. A c-traceability scheme can identify at least one of the colluders if up to c colluders have generated a pirate copy.

The need to secure non-DOD sensitive data in both the government and private sectors has required the development of very robust, high grade information security solutions that can be tailored to meet specific security needs. Harris has made a long term R & D investment into developing a robust information security architecture, that can be used in applications where Type 1 security is not required. The architecture is based on Harris's proprietary cryptographic algorithm technology. It supports Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) requirements and international markets requiring customer unique encryption. It is an ideal solution for the protection of defense and other national level interests, and provides state-of-the-art protection for both domestic and international users over any of the media used in modern communications. The first embedment of this architecture is the CITADELTM integrated circuit. CITADELTM is Harris' prime export encryption solution for all of its new products requiring security, such as the FALCON II HF, VHF, and Multi-band radio platforms.

If we consider that public key cryptography provides both digital signature and asymmetric encryption technologies, DA completes PKI by adding the missing half function. More importantly, DA can greatly increase PKI implementation service revenue.

The selection of the security controls should be driven by the business needs and the associated security requirement. This security requirement should be clearly defined in the information security policy and the security policy should dictate the set of controls that will provide the required protection.

This paper describes the development and execution of an experiment in layering. The basic hypothesis was that layers of defense, when added in a careful and systematic way to a base system lead to increased protection against attacks on the system. For the particular experiment, a mission and broad policy were defined and a base system was developed to support the mission and the policy. The boundary controller for the system was designed and developed as a series of layers; these elements became the main focus of experimentation on layering. The results tended to confirm the experimental hypothesis that layers have a cumulative effect on protection against outside attacks. However, there are often other opportunities for attackers to go around the layers or avoid them altogether. A broader methodological result was that the entire process of developing experiments needs to be carefully thought through. In addition, the experimental data resulting from this experiment provide only a limited corroboration for the given experimental hypothesis. © 2000 IEEE.","Availability; Control systems; Focusing; Information security; Laboratories; Mechanical factors; Protection; Testing","Availability; Control systems; Focusing; Laboratories; Security systems; Software testing; Testing; Boundary protection; Cumulative effects; Defense capability; Defense in depth; Information assurance; Information assurance programs; Mechanical factors; Protection; Security of data"

More specifically, it is devoted to possible applications to, and further dedicated development of, the accumulated considerable resources in NLP for, IAS. The expected and partially accomplished result is in harnessing the weird, illogical ways natural languages encode meaning, the very ways that defy all the usual combinatorial approaches to mathematical-and computational-complexity and make NLP so hard, to enhance information security. The paper is of a mixed theoretical and empirical nature. Of the four possible venues of applications, (i) memorizing randomly generated passwords with the help of automatically generated funny jingles, (ii) natural language water-marking, (iii) using the available machine translation (MT) systems for (additional) encryption of text messages, and (iv) downgrading, or sanitizing classified information in networks, two venues, (i) and (iv), have been at least partially implemented and the remaining two (ii) and (iii) are being implemented to the proof-of-concept level. We must make it very clear, however, that we have done very little experimentation or evaluation at this point, though we are moving quickly in that direction. The merits of the paper, if any, are in its venture to make considerable progress achieved recently in NLP, especially in knowledge representation and meaning analysis, useful for IAS needs. The NLP approach adopted here, ontological semantics, has been developed by two of the coauthors; watermarking is based on the pioneering research by another coauthor and his associates; most of the implementation of the password memorization software has been done by the fourth coauthor. All the four of us have agonized whether we should report this research now or wait till we have fully implemented all or at least some of the systems we are developing. At the end of the day, we have reached a consensus that it is important, even at this early stage, to review for the information security community what NLP can do for it and to invite feedback and further efforts and ideas on what seems likely to become a new paradigm in information security. To the body of the paper, we have added two self-contained deliberately reference-free appendices on NLP and ontological semantics, respectively, primarily for the benefit of those IAS readers, who are interested in expanding their understanding of those fields and further exploring their possible fruitful interactions with IAS.","","Computational complexity; Cryptography; Mathematical models; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Watermarking; Information assurance and security (IAS); Security of data"

Information security, therefore, is an essential management and technical requirement for any efficient and effective financial activities over the Internet. Still, its definition is a complex endeavor due to the constant technological and business change and requires a coordinated match of managerial and technical solutions. This research intends to provide an instrument to test and evaluate the strategies to counter threats facing online financial institutions through an artificial economic setup at the Synthetic Environments for Simulation and Analysis (SEAS) laboratory at the Krannert Graduate School of Management, Purdue University. The research also intends to provide guidelines for forming information security policies and strategies for survival and success in the dynamic and hostile business environment. Initial results indicate that online banks that were proactive in recognizing the threats and devising policies to counter them generated greater revenue and were able to focus on the core activities. Public disclosure of security breaches by the victim banks resulted in better overall health of the simulated economy.

We develop a framework for identifying interesting cases that can be used for building role-based delegation models. This is accomplished by identifying the characteristics related to delegation, using these characteristics to generate possible delegation cases, and using a systematic approach to reduce the large number of cases into few useful cases which can be used to build delegation models. © 2000 IEEE.","Access control; Character generation; Humans; Information security; Permission; Qualifications; Scanning probe microscopy; Software engineering","Access control; Scanning probe microscopy; Security of data; Security systems; Software engineering; Character generation; Humans; Machine to machines; Permission; Qualifications; Role-based; Role-based delegation; Network security"

The authors have proposed a regional information network system, which establishes a virtual local area network (LAN) environment for the home users based on the optical subscriber system. A group communication mechanism was proposed, where the subscriber terminals are connected in a loop, so that the access from other subscriber terminals can be prevented without burdening the user by procedures such as address registration. This article shows two implementations for such a group communication, from the side of the subscriber and from the center. The security of each implementation is evaluated, being reduced to physical safety, and the conditions for guaranteeing safety in group communication are derived. It is shown that the safety of group communication is secured by terminal authentication in the regional PC communication network system, basic on the physical composition of the port in the center, containing the multiplexing router, an automatic registration function for the MAC address of the terminal, and the star topology of the optical subscriber system.","","Computer terminals; Data communication systems; Local area networks; Network protocols; Personal computers; Routers; Virtual reality; Group communication security; Information security; Optical subscriber system; Security of data"

However most existing security systems remain passive and do not provide an active form of security protection. It is necessary to develop an active form of offensive approach to security protection in order to guard vital information infrastructures and thwart hackers. This paper presents a self-extension monitoring, a new approach in monitoring intruders, securing evidence against hackers and identifying them. It also proposes an intruder identification system (IIS), which is designed and implemented based on the proposed technique. The self-extension monitoring approach minimizes temporal and spatial limitations, making it possible to collect enough information for disclosure of the intruder's identity. A system security administrator can prevent any unwanted intrusion and re-attack the intruder by creating and maintaining information regarding the intruder's identity through the self-extension monitoring. © 2000 IEEE.","Computer hacking; Computer science; Computer security; Computerized monitoring; Information security; Intrusion detection; National security; Network servers; Protection; Shadow mapping","Computer science; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Monitoring; Personal computing; Security of data; Security systems; Computer hacking; Information infrastructures; Information warfare; Monitoring approach; Network server; Protection; Shadow mappings; Temporal and spatial; National security"

We therefore propose to extend this approach to the security aspects of a program. Our intention is to use such an approach as an efficient and realistic solution to the problem of malicious code detection in COTS.

This survey could not possibly canvas the needs of the entire community of Information Systems Audit, Control and Security Professionals who span many disciplines and professional societies. It does provide some information about their training needs, priorities and resources. The survey has gathered information from practicing professionals from the Big 5 Firms, private sector, consulting and government. Respondents of this survey came from not only the US, but Europe, Australia and Asia/Pacific Rim as well. With President Clinton's recent support to place Computer Security at the top of the nation's priority list, and the movement of a number of professional associations to recognize the need for continued training in this field as well as inclusion of questions relating to this field in their professional certification examinations has provide an incentive for University programs to provide educational resources to this area. The Information Systems Audit and Control Association has published its Model Curriculum for Information Systems Audit Education at the Undergraduate and Graduate level in May 1998. The National Colloquium of Information Systems Security Education was created in 1997 to provide a forum for leading figures in government, industry and academia to work in partnership to define current and emerging requirements for Information Systems Security Education. Many more professional associations worldwide have made similar announcements in an effort to improve the education of Information Security, Audit and Control. The results of this paper show the level and areas of need in information audit, control and security education. It provides a baseline for other surveys to be initiated within geographic areas. Universities, working in partnership with industry, government and professional associations can help identify such training needs and in turn, offer coursework or certificate programs to help develop the information systems audit, control and security professional of the present and future.","","Curricula; Management; Professional aspects; Security of data; Security systems; Surveys; Certificate programs; Continued trainings; Educational resource; Information systems security; Information technology professionals; Professional associations; Professional certifications; Security professionals; Information systems"

On-card code verification could be a solution for improving card deployment flexibility. However, due to the small amount of resources, the verification process is generally done off-card, and checking downloaded code on-card is a real challenge. The FACADE architecture proposes to generate a certificate off-card and to check the code using this certificate on-card.

That is, users can request data access from multiple locations within a distributed computing system. To complicate this type of operation, however, data can be distributed and represented in multiple forms. As a result, system administrators are encountering increasing difficulty in developing and managing application-specific policies for users and data. A multi-tier (N-tier) architecture can provide a powerful solution for meeting the diverse needs of the electronic commerce applications. However, a drawback to multi-tier architectures is that they require that a user's credentials and the policy-to-data mapping context must be available in the middle tier of the system architecture. This paper addresses the management of users and data by presenting a framework for combining attribute certificates with a mobile policy for effective application-specific control specification and administration in a distributed computing environment. Attribute certificates provide mobility to credentials and also provide fine-grained information about security principles. A mobile policy allows application-specific policies to move along with the data to other elements of the distributed computing system. We propose a high-level definition language to specify policies that are application-specific and mobile, and present an algorithm for enforcing attribute-based mobile policies. © 2000 IEEE.","Access control; Authorization; Computer architecture; Data security; Databases; Distributed computing; Electronic commerce; Information security; Logic; Mobile computing","Access control; Client server computer systems; Commerce; Computation theory; Computer architecture; Database systems; Electronic commerce; High level languages; Mobile commerce; Mobile computing; Security of data; Security systems; Authorization; Computing environments; Control specifications; Distributed computing environment; Distributed computing systems; Electronic commerce applications; Logic; Multi tier architecture; Distributed computer systems"

For instance, Java technology facilitates dynamic loading of application code from remote servers on to heterogeneous clients distributed all over the Internet. However, executing foreign code that has been loaded from the network raises significant security concerns which limit the diffusion of these technologies. Substantial work has already been done to provide security solutions for protecting both hosting nodes and MC. For example, the Java security architecture evolved from a rigid sandbox model to a more flexible solution where downloaded code can perform any kind of operation, depending on its source location and signature. However, the most widespread security solutions for MC platforms today do not support the sophisticated security policies required in modern inter-organisational environments. This requires expressive languages to specify the policy and flexible mechanisms for policy implementation which cater for code mobility. This paper shows how access control policies for MC-based applications can be specified in a concise and declarative language called Ponder, and how these policies can be implemented within the Java security architecture. © 2000 IEEE.","Access control; Dynamic programming; Information security; Internet; Java; Mobile computing; Network servers; Permission; Protection; Web server","Access control; Codes (symbols); Computational linguistics; Dynamic loads; Dynamic programming; Internet; Java programming language; Memory architecture; Mobile computing; Network architecture; Security of data; Security systems; XML; Java; Network server; Permission; Protection; Web servers; Network security"

In our study, decision tree classifiers are used to classify activities in a computer and network system into different states and determine the possibility of an intrusion based on the state classification. Our design of decision tree classifiers is based on an incremental tree induction algorithm. Two decision tree classifiers are developed. One decision tree classifier examines single events of activities in a computer and network system for intrusion detection (single event version). Another decision tree classifier examines a sequence of events in a moving window at a given time for intrusion detection (moving window version). We use computer audit data for training and testing the decision tree classifiers. The testing results of the two decision tree classifiers are analyzed and compared. The ""moving window"" version of the decision tree classifier produces better performance in intrusion detection.","","Algorithms; Computers; Data mining; Data reduction; Decision making; Problem solving; Security of data; Computer intrusion detection; Decision tree; Induction algorithms; Intrusion detection; Computer networks"

One approach for modeling military planning systems is to partition the process into separable components and analyze the components individually. This paper takes the position that the cognitive model should contain details of the domain being supported and, especially for support of on-line re-planning, knowledge of the system implementation architecture - including performance modeling of the implementation architecture. A possible issue is the failure of the separable components assumption when the system is composed of components (i.e. components are not separable when the inputs to system components are affected by the outputs of the components). We discuss these thoughts in some detail and provide an overview of a test bed framework being implemented to perform experiments on the validity of this approach. In particular, we are interested in creating analysis tools that apply metrics to sensed data to assist in determining when a re-planning activity is required and in prioritizing re-planning activities. The framework is intended to support experiments with military decision making and, in particular, with re-planning activities that support execution of a military Operation Order (OPORD). We are investigating use of a new simulation tool to accumulate information at the message-packet-level and perform analysis at the network-application-level. We discuss use of this framework for pattern recognition of activities distributed in time and space. We provide an introduction to our approach for partitioning the problem space and some ideas on design of experiments using this approach. Finally, we assert that this level of detail is required to enable assessment of the information assurance situation to support evaluation of risks, as well as implementation and application of metrics for analysis of alternatives for reacting to attacks and monitoring of the selected alternatives.","","Computer simulation; Decision theory; Mathematical models; Strategic planning; System stability; Tactical data systems; Task organization; Military data processing"

The assumed technique is not mature today, but is like to appear in the near future, especially for attacking a tamper resistant device with an embedded DES VLSI chip. In this paper, we proposed a new hardware design for the DES cipher to resist DFA. By adding some protection circuitry, all the unidirectional faults induced into the registers of a DES chip can be detected, and then alter to the cryptosystem immediately.

However, risk analysis is based on a very simple model of IS as consisting of assets, mainly data, hardware and software, which are vulnerable to various threats Thus, risk analysis cannot provide for an understanding of the organisational environment in which IS operate. We believe that a comprehensive methodology for information systems security analysis and design (IS-SAD) should incorporate both risk analysis and organisational analysis, based on business process modelling (BPM) techniques. This paper examines the possible contribution of BPM techniques to IS-SAD and identifies the conceptual and methodological requirements for a technique to be used in this context. Based on these requirements, several BPM techniques have been reviewed.

Examples of such functionality include user interface management, file system access, process and thread creation and synchronization, and network communications. In the Windows NT operating system, an application obtains this functionality through calls on functions exported from shared libraries. Smiley is a monitoring program that can selectively log these calls as they are made by any application. It does so without any modification of the persistent executable images of either the application or the libraries. Logs of library calls provide insight into an application's implementation. By interactively selecting libraries and functions to monitor, an analyst gradually homes in on aspects of an implementation that are relevant to his objectives. Since it requires only the distributed binary form of the application, Smiley can be used as an aid in comprehending the implementation of COTS software. © 2000 IEEE.","Application software; Documentation; File systems; Information analysis; Information security; Monitoring; Operating systems; Read only memory; Reflection; Software tools","Bins; Computer aided software engineering; Computer operating systems; Computer programming; Computer software; Embedded systems; File organization; Information analysis; Libraries; Monitoring; Reflection; ROM; Security of data; System program documentation; User interfaces; Windows operating system; File systems; Function calls; Interactive tool; Interface management; Interprocess communication; Monitoring programs; Network communications; Shared libraries; Application programs"

The first situation, level of descriptiveness, is deemed to be questionable because it may prove eventually that end-users fail to internalize target goals and do not follow security guidelines, for example - which is inadequate. Moreover, the role of motivation in the area of information security is not considered seriously enough, even though its role has been widely recognized. To tackle such weaknesses, this paper constructs a conceptual foundation for information systems/organizational security awareness. The normative and prescriptive nature of end-user guidelines will be considered. In order to understand human behaviour, the behavioural science framework, consisting in intrinsic motivation, a theory of planned behaviour and a technology acceptance model, will be depicted and applied. Current approaches (such as the campaign) in the area of information security awareness and education will be analyzed from the viewpoint of the theoretical framework, resulting in information on their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, a novel persuasion strategy aimed at increasing users' commitment to security guidelines is presented.","","Information dissemination; Information retrieval systems; Information security awareness; Security of data"

Although focused on information technology issues, HIPAA will ultimately impact day-to-day operations at multiple levels within any clinical setting. Optometrists must begin to familiarize themselves with HIPAA in order to prepare themselves to practice in a technology-enriched environment. Method: Title II of HIPAA, entitled ""Administration Simplification,"" is intended to reduce the costs and administrative burden of healthcare by standardizing the electronic transmission of administrative and financial transactions. The Department of Health and Human Services is expected to publish the final rules and regulations that will govern HIPAA's implementation this year. Results: The rules and regulations will cover three key aspects of healthcare delivery: electronic data interchange (EDI), security, and privacy. EDI will standardize the format for healthcare transactions. Health plans must accept and respond to all transactions in the EDI format. Security refers to policies and procedures that protect the accuracy and integrity of information and limit access. Privacy focuses on how the information is used and disclosure of identifiable health information. Security and privacy regulations apply to all information that is maintained and transmitted in a digital format and require administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. Conclusions: HIPAA will force the healthcare industry to adopt an e-commerce paradigm and provide opportunities to improve patient care processes. Optometrists should take advantage of the opportunity to develop more efficient and profitable practices.","Administration simplification; Electronic data interchange; Health information; HIPAA; Legislation; Privacy; Security","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; Humans; Optometry; United States; health insurance; human; optometry; organization and management; review; United States"

An enhanced mechanism to enable construction in the presence of malicious faults, which can intentionally modify their pieces of the information, was later presented by Krawczyk. Yet, these methods assume that the malicious faults occur only at reconstruction time. In this paper we address the more general problem of secure storage and retrieval of information (SSRI), and guarantee that also the process of storing the information is correct even when some of the servers fail. Our protocols achieve this while maintaining the (asymptotical) space optimality of the above methods. We also consider SSRI with the added requirement of confidentiality, by which no party except for the rightful owner of the information is able to learn anything about it. This is achieved through novel applications of cryptographic techniques, such as the distributed generation of receipts, distributed key management via threshold cryptography, and ""blinding"". An interesting byproduct of our scheme is the construction of a secret sharing scheme with shorter shares size in the amortized sense. An immediate practical application of our work is a system for the secure deposit of sensitive data. We also extend SSRI to a ""proactive"" setting, where an adversary may corrupt all the servers during the lifetime of the system, but only a fraction during any given time interval. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

But how are these new age criminals gaining their skills? Many are suggesting it is the hallowed halls of the nation's and world's universities and colleges, and even the lower educational levels, which are providing the skills. As technology is exponentially increasing, so is the incidence of cyber attacks. In the recent episodes of computer espionage and attacks, hackers have become much more sophisticated and more alarmingly, much younger. The computer is a man-made device that requires political, legal, and ethical responsibilities. In assessing the social responsibilities associated with information technology as we move into the new millennium, the organization must address three simple questions: (1) Is it legal?; (2) Is it balanced?; and (3) How will it make me feel? An ethical environment within an organization utilizing information technology can be easily established, with or without an ethics officer, if the organization follows the guide of these questions. This ethical environment will demonstrate a corporate and educational conscience that could lead the organization into the next century.
