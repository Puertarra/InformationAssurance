The constant throughout these occurrences is that no matter what the climate, fundamental business processes have changed little. And, as always, the focus of any business impact assessment is to assess the time-critical priority of these business processes. With these more recent realities in mind, this chapter has been updated and is now offered for your consideration. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The primary mission of the security function is to assure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information. However, this mission must be accomplished within the context of security as a facilitator for the development and delivery of the organization's products and services. Security must be viewed as the organization where one goes for answers about how to securely move forward with a new product or service and to ensure that the company's trust commitment to its customers and partners is being achieved.

Legal authorities warn that laws and regulations regarding information protection and privacy will continue to evolve over the next decade. These rules will continue to dictate how firms and government agencies protect and safeguard customer privacy information. The most effective and efficient way to guarantee compliance to these laws and regulations is through the adoption of risk management systems. Such a framework will provide a foundational information security management system leading to compliance and risk reduction and mitigation. Many functional areas within an organization practice risk management and deal with various aspects of risk management, including information security, business continuity planning (BCP), disaster recovery planning (DRP), insurance, finance, and internal auditing, to name a few.

With the development of storage area network (SAN) technology, hard drives and tape drives are not necessarily directly attached to a host anymore but could be rather physically distant-up to several hundred kilometers or even around the globe. Such a flexibility of logically instead of physically attached storage devices to a host made them remotely accessible and highly available; however, it brought into consideration all security elements of the modern network environment, such as privacy, integrity of the data in transit, and authentication of the remotely connected devices. From the data perspective, one can distinguish between storage network security, which refers to protection of the data while it is in transit, versus storage data security, which refers to when the data is stored on tapes or hard drives.

Introducing key concepts, Mechanics of User Identification and Authentication: Fundamentals of Identity Management outlines the process of controlled access to resources through authentication, authorization, and accounting in an in-depth, yet accessible manner. It examines today's security landscape and the specific threats to user authentication. The book then outlines the process of controlled access to resources and discusses the types of user credentials that can be presented as proof of identity prior to accessing a computer system. It also contains an overview on cryptography that includes the essential approaches and terms required for understanding how user authentication works.

As technology progresses, students face increasing attacks on their information systems. Rather than educate students solely in the classroom, we implemented two experiences to increase student understanding of modern information assurance using the students themselves: the student information security officers (SISOs) and the Carronade exercise. The student information security officer program empowers students to address information assurance education of their fellow students. Students are organized into groups of approximately 120 and each group is assigned a SISO. The SISOs are organized in a hierarchy so that ultimately one SISO is responsible for all. The SISOs educate and mentor their students on safe computing through formal classes in their dorms, formal inspections of personal computers, security awareness exercises, and assisting students when they encounter a problem. The empowerment of students to operationally lead their student organization has resulted in marked improvements in student learning regarding information assurance and computer attacks. An indicator of this learning is the Carronade exercise. The Carronade exercise is an immersive information security awareness exercise conducted very semester since September 2003. SISOs launch the exercise using an automated phishing tool that generates a phishing email attack against every student under the control of the SISO. If a student succumbs to the attack, the SISO is informed of the identity of student. No personal information is transmitted. The SISO then has an opportunity to mentor the student and explain why the email was a phishing attack and what the telltale signs were that identified the email as an attack. Because the attack occurs in the normal work environment of the students, it is viewed as highly relevant to the students. Due to the low threat and personal mentoring approach employed to resolve mistakes, students are receptive to the exercise. This has led to a marked improvement in student performance against phishing attacks over the last three years. The empowering of students to teach and mentor their fellow students through the SISO and Carronade programs has proven to be very successful. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2007.","","Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Students; Teaching; Information assurance; Security awareness; Student information security officers; Information analysis"

These may include the application of cryptography, the hierarchical modeling of organizations in order to assure confidentiality, or the distribution of accountability and responsibility by law, among interested parties. The history of Information Security reaches back to ancient times and starts with the emergence of bureaucracy in administration and warfare. Some aspects, such as the interception of encrypted messages during World War II, have attracted huge attention, whereas other aspects have remained largely uncovered. There has never been any effort to write a comprehensive history. This is most unfortunate, because Information Security should be perceived as a set of communicating vessels, where technical innovations can make existing legal or organisational frame-works obsolete and a breakdown of political authority may cause an exclusive reliance on technical means. This book is intended as a first field-survey. It consists of twenty-eight contributions, written by experts in such diverse fields as computer science, law, or history and political science, dealing with episodes, organisations and technical developments that may considered to be exemplary or have played a key role in the development of this field. These include: the emergence of cryptology as a discipline during the Renaissance, the Black Chambers in 18th century Europe, the breaking of German military codes during World War II, the histories of the NSA and its Soviet counterparts and contemporary cryptology. Other subjects are: computer security standards, viruses and worms on the Internet, computer transparency and free software, computer crime, export regulations for encryption software and the privacy debate. - Interdisciplinary coverage of the history Information Security - Written by top experts in law, history, computer and information science - First comprehensive work in Information Security. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Many systems fail not ultimately for technical reasons but because incentives are wrong. For example, the people who guard a system often are not the people who suffer the full costs of failure, and as a result they make less effort than would be socially optimal. Some aspects of information security are public goods, like clean air or water; externalities often decide which security products succeed in the marketplace; and some information risks are not insurable because they are correlated in ways that cause insurance markets to fail. Deeper applications of game-theoretic ideas can be found in the games of incomplete information that occur when critical information, such as about software quality or defender efforts, is hidden from some principals. An interesting application lies in the analysis of distributed system architectures; it took several years of experimentation for designers of peer-to-peer systems to understand incentive issues that we can now analyze reasonably well. Evolutionary game theory has recently allowed us to tie together a number of ideas from network analysis and elsewhere to explain why basing peer-to-peer systems on rings is a bad idea, and why revolutionaries use cells instead. The economics of distributed systems looks like being a very fruitful field of research. © Noam Nisan, Tim Roughgarden, Éva Tardos, Vijay V.

With cyber crime on the rise, both government and industry have come to rely on academia to properly train future IA professionals, reducing the need for professional developmental courses. This presents a topic for debate since there is some disagreement if it is legally or ethically appropriate to teach IW techniques in an academic setting due to the many risks involved. In order to address the questions raised by teaching these skills, we examine the legal and ethical responsibilities of IA professionals and how this affects educational programs. We identify several key knowledge areas and skill sets that IA professionals require and examine the benefits and risks that are associated with teaching these skills. The legal aspects of the issue are addressed by examining important computer security laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act and the Federal Criminal Code, and how they affect education at the institution, instructor and student level. Evaluation of the ethical issues is done by using the ACM Code of Ethics as well as two ethical theories: utilitarianism, based on maximizing the good consequences for society; and deontology, where ethical actions are based on an individual's duties and the rights of others. We conclude by offering our recommendations for creating an IA program by addressing the need for cyber defense exercises and test-bed environments. In addition, we provide some topics for consideration on how to safely teach these skills and reduce the possibility of an incident. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2007.","","Codes (symbols); Engineering education; Professional aspects; Risk analysis; Security of data; Cyber crime; Information assurance (IA); Information warfare (IW); Information analysis"

Important factors that determine national security competence—military operations, intelligence information on advanced weapons and enemy forces, economic activities that form the poles of national power, government's major systems—are exposed to hostile cyber attacks or accidental intrusions. Therefore, protecting information systems has emerged as an urgent national security issue. In particular, in waging wars, the concept of electronic/communications war that seek destruction of enemy command and control system, has been transformed into a more comprehensive and proactive concept of information warfare by the introduction of the cyber war doctrine. Information warfare encompasses pursuit of paralysis and destruction of a nation's all social infrastructure system and military control power. The existing concept of security strategy, which is a passive concept devised for protection of national information and information system, has been replaced by the proactive and aggressive concept of information warfare strategy. Information warfare seek early and effective victory by cyber attacks that can destroy the enemy's war capability and morale. Korea, which is a leader in information technology as well as a country vulnerable to attacks challenging information security, should prepare for information warfare of the twenty first century. Provision of more systematic and detailed measures—new response strategies, the establishment of national information security response system, creation or reorganization of institutions, and training of human resources—to cope with changes in international information security environment is called for. In addition, the private, public, and military organizations should work together to introduce joint defense strategies and organizations. As an organic integrated defense system has to be established, the government has to establish a governmental system for systematic system for threat assessment, judgment, and response. In particular, the role and responsibilities of the NSC should be upgraded. The government has been tilted toward domestic security and social issues as it responded to cyber crimes and terrors. Such tendency should be guarded against. © 2007, Center for International Area Studies, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

The few who understand the magic of technology can be separated into two sides-those who work to protect technology and those who try to exploit it. The first are information security professionals, the latter hackers. To many, a hacker’s ability to invade systems does seem magic. For security professionals-who understand the magic-it is a frustrating battle where the numbers are in the hackers’ favor. Security professionals must simultaneously protect every single possible access point, but a hacker only needs a single weakness to successfully attack a system. The lifecycle in this struggle is: • Protection • Detection • Response • Investigation • Prosecution First, organizations work on protecting their technology. Because 100 percent protection is not possible, organizations realized that if they could not completely protect their systems, they needed to be able to detect when an attack occurred. This led to the development of intrusion detection systems (IDSs). As organizations developed and deployed IDSs, the inevitable occurred: “According to our IDS, we’ve been hacked! Now what?"" This quickly led to the formalization of incident response. In the beginning, most organizations’ response plans centered on getting operational again as quickly as possible. Finding out the identity of the attacker was often a low priority. But as computers became a primary storage and transfer medium for money and proprietary information, even minor hacks quickly became expensive. In attempts to recoup their losses, organizations are increasingly moving into the investigation and prosecution stages of the life cycle. Today, although protection and detection are invaluable, organizations must be prepared to effectively handle the response, investigation, and prosecution of computer incidents. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

In 2006, SE is still a topic for discussion and efforts continue to come to terms with the risks that it poses. There has been no satisfying answer reached on how to mitigate the risk, no meaningful or valid statistics related specifically to SE exist, and most organizations have opted for the ostrich approach-burying their heads in the sand and hoping it will all go away. Sadly, this is the same landscape that existed in 2002 and prompted the original chapter on this topic. One thing that has changed, however, is the fact that attacks using SE have skyrocketed (e.g., identity theft, phishing). This chapter is a call to arms, of sorts.

No question, the business imperative supports accepting and mitigating this risk, thereby further enabling organizations to partner and team externally and electronically with business partners, customers, suppliers, vendors, etc.; however, if organizations wade into this environment blindly, without upgrading the existing information security infrastructure, technologies, tools, and processes, they may inadvertently put their organization at risk. Organizations that embark on identity management implementations, not just for compliance projects but as their core underlying security infrastructure, will ensure consistent, standard, and compliant security solutions for the enterprise. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Using different techniques and controls can multiply the effectiveness of security controls in an increasingly diverse risk environment. Using overlapping controls can also provide redundancy that is important if a control should fail. Information technology security controls and response processes address different areas within an environment. These include network controls, operating system controls, and application level controls, as well as monitoring and responses to security events. Attention must also be paid to the coverage of the different controls, as the failure to provide protection for one piece of the application or service may lead to compromise of other areas. Providing adequate protection for all the pieces of an application will ensure its proper functioning and reduce the risk of its being compromised. It is also possible for one control to provide overlapping protection for other areas. Maximizing the overlapping protection and providing diversity within each one of these controls and processes are important to minimizing the risk of a security failure with regard to the information or services being protected. In addition, response and monitoring processes must also be able to address incidents and provide solutions in a timely manner. These controls and processes can also take advantage of diversity to reduce the risk of a single point of failure. Together, these controls and processes work to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information or service being secured. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The Wi-Fi Alliance industry consortium since then has made several efforts to address the security issues as well as interoperability of the security solution; and as result of that effort, in mid-2003, the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) specification was born to address major security issues within the WEP protocol.

Testing BC/DR plans is done with regard to justifying the economic benefit of having BC/DR capabilities in place. A company that decides not to test its BC/DR plans will not know if those capabilities and documented procedures will work during a disaster and thus jeopardize survivability of the enterprise.

The increasing variety of threats and ferociousness of attacks has made protecting an organization’s information resource a complex challenge. Improved knowledge of the critical issues underlying information security can help practitioners and researchers to understand and solve the most challenging problems. With this objective, the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (ISC)2 teamed up with Auburn University researchers to identify and study the top information security issues in two sequential, but related, surveys. The first survey involved a worldwide sample of 874 certified information system security professionals (CISSPs) who ranked a list of 25 information security issues based on the most critical issues facing organizations today. The survey results produced some interesting findings. The criticality of top management support was demonstrated by the respondents who ranked it 1 of 25 issues. This finding suggests that top management support is the most critical element of an organization’s information security program. As one study participant put it, “Management buy-in and increasing the security awareness of employees is key. Technology is great, but without.management’s backing, all the bits in the world won’t help.” Based on the results of opinions, conclusions, and recommendations expressed or implied within are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of USAFA, USAF, the DoD or any other government agency.

Some have been based on applied management strategy (such as portfolio management), old warring tactics (scenario planning), and modern day economics (feasibility studies and cost to market). Most of these attempts at risk management have been created and implemented by professionals in a specific industry, areas of academia and consulting firms, not the actual business areas dealing with the risks. Little attention has been paid to the complex processes taking place among work producers, business decision makers, applying a risk management concept and then managing the concept itself. © 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Within the last five years in particular, there has been a significant emphasis on information security through emerging laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), SarbanesOxley (SOX), the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and the refinement of supporting control frameworks such as ISO17799 (ISO27001: 2005), Control OBjectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT), Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), and others. Why is this significant? In the past, where information security was relegated to log-on IDs and passwords performed somewhere deep in the information technology organization as an IT task typically performed by a lower-level associate, today there is an increasing recognition that information security is essential to the business. Along with this recognition is also the recognition that the CISO is an individual who needs to have a wide range of skills to be effective within the organization. © 2008 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Many rootkits are designed to invade the “root,” or kernel, of the program, and therefore operate without announcing their presence to the owner of the computer. Although some rootkits are written with noble intentions (e.g., to strengthen an anti-virus package), true rootkits have a malicious purpose. A rootkit infection can render a compromised computer system vulnerable to attacks and corruption. Rootkits are named for their origin in Linux systems, but the number of rootkits that attack Microsoft operating systems has recently proliferated. Not only are rootkits difficult to detect and assess, but at times the only effective way to remove them is to do a clean installation of the entire operating system. Recent discoveries of rootkits in other venues prove that the problem is spreading and is a major concern for administrators in information security. xThis paper presents a brief history of the development of rootkits and their possible effects.Prominent cases involving rootkits are described.The paper concludes with an overview of methods to prevent rootkits and to (hopefully) eradicate one that has infected an operating system. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Computer virus; Malware; Rootkit; Security",""

The Tabu Search enhanced Markov Blanket (TS/MB) procedure is based on the use of restricted neighborhoods in a general Bayesian Network constrained by the Markov condition, called Markov Blanket Neighborhoods. Computational results from two real world healthcare data sets indicate that the TS/MB procedure converges fast and is able to find a parsimonious model with substantially fewer predictor variables than in the full data set. Furthermore, it has comparable or better prediction performance when compared against several machine learning methods, and provides insight into possible causal relations among the variables. © 2007 The authors.

IO is a superset of other military operations such as Psychological Operations (PSYOP), Electronic Warfare (EW), Operations Security (OPSEC) and Information Assurance (IA). Hence IO is often viewed as an overarching integrating strategy that is still maturing, when compared to the older legacy warfare communities mentioned above. This view has in the author's opinion led to an overall lack of support from a fiscal, personnel and policy perspective. The diffuse nature of IO may also lead to confusion or lack of awareness of research opportunities by academics, especially with regard to aligning oneself to Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. Normally a rich source of funding or grants, at first glance it appears that the DoD contract opportunities in the IO and Information Warfare (IW) areas, are more scattered than and not as numerous as the more specific skill sets such as IA and Information Technology (IT). For example, One can easily cite very large DoD and Federal IA contracts such as DISA I-Assure, ANSWER, Millenia, etc., that are all worth billions of dollars, which are available to the DoD to support IT and IA issues. But the same cannot often be readily be said of IO and IW, where the appearance is the contract vehicles that are available tend to be fewer and much smaller. The questions for this paper are then does this dichotomy really exist? Is so, why? If not, why is this assumption so readily accepted? Finally, where are the main DoD contracts in the IO and IW arena that are available to access for academic researchers? Are the majority of these opportunities based on the older legacy areas of EW, PSYOP, IA, etc or on the more broader issue area of IO and IW?. This paper will attempt to answer these questions as it addresses the evolution and development of IO and IW contracts across the DoD, and their potential for academic researchers. It will show why the differential has developed with other areas such as IA, and what are the current opportunities are that exist today. This paper will also show what the future may hold for further growth in this area and how the growth of IO, IW and IA contract vehicles can benefit universities and academics. Finally, this paper will also suggest future areas of research that academics may be interested in exploring, to best optimize their ability to secure grants and contracts over the next few years.","Contracts; Department of defense; Information operations; Information warfare; Proposals","Contracts; Electronic warfare; Information technology; Research; Academic research; Department of Defense; Growth opportunities; Information assurance; Information operations; Information warfare; Proposals; Research opportunities; Education"

In this paper, we first provide an architectural overview of identity and access management (IDAM) technologies along with an analysis of patenting activities to establish that the IDAM market segment dominates the information security sector. An empirical study, based on data pertaining to public firms with a significant share of the IDAM market, shows that regulations and the frequency of malicious attacks are strongly correlated with increasing demand. While demand for identity and access management products has been exponentially increasing, innovation has only been moving at a moderate rate after declining near the end of the market bubble of 2000. The stock market's valuation of IDAM firms, while controlling for overall market conditions, has consequently been fairly static since 2001 and has followed similar trends in other segments of the IT industry. We therefore propose a two-pronged strategy involving: (i) standardization efforts on the engineering front; and (ii) additional regulations to stimulate innovation by IDAM firms. © 2008 IEEE.","Identity and access management; Information security; Innovation; Market value; Regulations","Finance; Network security; Security of data; Standardization; Empirical studies; Engineering challenges; Identity and access managements; Malicious attack; Market condition; Market values; Patenting activities; Regulations; Commerce"

By information warfare I mean deliberate, organized political actions and processes carried out or conducted in order to disrupt, destroy and annul conditions for meeting the needs for information vital for the inhabitants of the community (alliance) of a particular country or countries. The basic thesis of this presentation is that knowledge centres and their developing global network have a major importance in mitigating the threat arising from information warfare. Organising knowledge centres into a network, the creation of harmony between civil control and state financing, and the network's global nature extending across country-borders seeks the dissolution and the exceeding of such contradictions, a condition of which is the development of a new security culture. The operation of knowledge centres requires interactive supervision for which civil associations should be made responsible. The development of the global informational society came to a standstill following the events of 11th September 2001. The defence of individual rights has decreased due to the necessary security measures imposed by governments. For solving the security problems occurring on the side of privacy the spread of the new security culture is indispensable. With the promoting of the creation of new security knowledge, the knowledge centres play an important role in the field of the evolution of the new security culture.","Information security issues related to information retaining principle security of the virtual world's cyber security; Knowledge centers; New security culture","Full informations; Information warfare; Informational societies; Knowledge centers; Political actions; Security measure; Security problems; Virtual worlds; Network security"

In fact, over the past years, the most important consortiums of the Internet, like IETF, W3C or OASIS, have produced a huge number of WS-based security standards. Despite this spectacular growth, a development process that facilitates the systematic integration of security into all subprocesses of WS-based software development life-cycle does not exist. Eventually, this process should guide WS-based software developers in the specification of WS-based security requirements, the design of WS-based security architectures, and the deployment of the most suitable WS security standards.

Once an information assurance vulnerability notice is given for a system, it is important for reducing massive system engineering efforts for IA vulnerability modeling. When systems are updated by security patch for mitigating system vulnerability, modelling based on vulnerability update and request is trivial, in order to increase accuracy, efficiency and effectiveness of software processes. By employing XML technology, we can achieve seamless and efficient asset management between heterogeneous data formats in analysing and exchanging the pertinent information for information assurance vulnerability. Thus, when a system is updated to comply system vulnerability, the proposed SOAbased IA vulnerability modeling and algorithm is proliferating. Then, an executable model for vulnerability modelling to verify the proposed scheme and testing environment is presented to mitigate vulnerable systems for sustained system.","","e-government; Information services; XML; Heterogeneous data; Information assurance; Information assurance vulnerability notices; Sustained systems; System vulnerability; Testing environment; Vulnerability models; Vulnerable systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA)"

Along this direction, the MPWG has recently released a Trusted Mobile Phone Reference Architecture Specification. In order to realize trusted mobile platforms, they adapt well-known concepts like TPM, isolation, integrity measurement, etc. from the trusted PC world - with slight modifications due to the characteristics and resource limitations of mobile devices - into generic mobile phone platforms. The business needs of mobile phone industry mandate 4 different stakeholders (platform owners): device manufacturer, cellular service provider, general service provider, and of course the end-user. The specification requires separate trusted and isolated operational domains, so called Trusted Engines, for each of these stakeholders. Although the TCG MPWG does not explicitly prescribe a specific technical realization of these Trusted Engines, a general perception suggests reusing the very well established (Trusted) Virtualization concept from corresponding PC architectures. However, despite of all its merits, the current ""resource devourer"" Virtualization is not very well suited for mobile devices. Thus, in this paper, we propose another isolation technique, which is specifically crafted for mobile phone platforms and respects its resource limitations. We achieve this goal by realizing the TCG's Trusted Mobile Phone specification by leveraging SELinux which provides a generic domain isolation concept at the kernel level. Additional to harnessing the potential of SELinux to realize mobile phone specific (isolated) operational domains, we are also able to seamlessly integrate the important integrity measurement and verification concept into our SELinux-based Trusted Mobile Phone architecture. This is achieved by defining some SELinux policy language extensions. Thus, the present paper provides a novel, efficient and inherently secure TCG-aware Mobile Phone reference architecture. © 2007 ACM.","Isolation; Secure kernel; Security architecture; SELinux; Trusted mobile computing","Architecture; Engines; Mobile computing; Mobile security; Specifications; Trusted computing; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Isolation; Mobile platform; Mobile-computing; Reference architecture; Secure kernel; Security Architecture; SELinux; Trusted computing groups; Trusted mobile computing; Working groups; Cellular telephones"

Kuwait, like any developing country, is currently launching major e-service projects aiming at improving government processes, connect government to citizens, and build interactions within the civil society. The e-services category of e-government applications enables interactions and relationships between the government and citizens, through which the latter gain access to a range of public services. However, the implementation process of e-services involves many factors of risk that could threaten the success of the process. Therefore, an effective risk management process is an important component of a successful information security program. This paper investigates and discusses the possibilities of e-services risk areas and assesses the security and privacy protection issues in some ministries in Kuwait. The results show that the total average percentage of applying security and privacy issues in the studied ministries is moderate. The Ministry of Communications (MoC) has the highest percentage of applications, whereas the Ministry of Trading and Industry (MoTI) has the lowest. Physical security is the highest applied variable, while prevention of unauthorized access is the lowest one.","E-services; Risk assessment; Security and privacy issues; State of Kuwait","Asia; Eurasia; Kuwait [Middle East]; Middle East; Project management; Risk assessment; Risk management; Social aspects; civil society; developing world; public service; risk assessment; security threat"

The emerging field of information security is thus, as with many other facets within an enterprise, required not only to prove itself in business and technological terms, but also in economic terms. The added value that is to be achieved by investments in information security is consequently expected to become an increasingly important subject of scrutiny. This underscores the need of various experts within an enterprise (or a public sector organisation) to have access to a compact and practical means of illustrating the importance of investments in information security to the enterprise's management. For that purpose a Cost Benefit Toolbox will be presented. This toolbox represents exactly the sort of instrument in that it effectively allows one to focus on the core element of information security, namely, the task of comparing risks and security investments.","","Cost effectiveness; Information management; Investments; Added values; Core elements; Cost benefits; Public sector; Security investments; Security of data"

This approach addresses a unique weakness of wireless networks whereby network traffic traverses a public wireless medium making traditional boundary controls ineffective. Specifically, a randomized array transmission scheme is developed to guarantee wireless transmissions with inherent low-probabilityof- interception (LPI). In contrast to conventional spread spectrum or data encryption techniques, this new method exploits the redundancy of transmit antenna arrays for deliberate signal randomization which, when combined with channel diversity, effectively randomizes the eavesdropper's signals but not the authorized receiver's signals. The LPI of this transmission scheme is analyzed via proving the indeterminacy of the eavesdropper's blind deconvolution. Extensive simulations and some preliminary experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness. The proposed method is useful for securing wireless transmissions, or for supporting upper-layer key management protocols. © 2006 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Antenna array; Channel; Diversity; Transmit beamforming; Wireless information assurance","Antennas; Beam forming networks; Convolution; Cryptography; Network layers; Redundancy; Signal processing; Signal receivers; Transmissions; Wireless networks; Channel; Deliberate signal randomizations; Diversity; Information assurance; Key management protocols; Secure wireless network; Signal processing technique; Transmit beamforming; Antenna arrays"

Nevertheless, it is still possible to link released data with some public or easy-to-access databases to obtain confidential information. To safeguard privacy, numerous techniques, such as generalization, suppression, and microaggregation, have been proposed to modify the to-be-released data. In this paper, we propose attribute-oriented granulation as a data protection mechanism that can integrate both generalization and microaggregation into a uniform framework. We address the computational issue of searching for the most specific granulation that satisfies confidentiality requirements. A breadth-first search algorithm with basic pruning strategies is presented and its properties are investigated. The properties can be used to improve the efficiency of our algorithm.

However, the sheer number of security alerts output by security sensors can overwhelm security analysts and keep them from performing effective analysis and initiating timely response. Therefore, it is important to develop an advanced alert correlation system that can reduce alarm redundancy, intelligently correlate security alerts and detect attack strategies. Alert correlation is therefore a core component of a security management system. Correlating security alerts and discovering attack strategies are important and challenging tasks for security analysts. Recently, there have been several proposed techniques to analyze attack scenarios from security alerts. However, most of these approaches depend on a priori and hard-coded domain knowledge that lead to their limited capabilities of detecting new attack strategies. In addition, these approaches focus more on the aggregation and analysis of raw security alerts, and build basic or low-level attack scenarios. This paper focuses on discovering novel attack strategies via analysis of security alerts. Our integrated alert correlation system helps security administrator aggregate redundant alerts, filter out unrelated attacks, correlate security alerts and analyze attack scenarios. Our integrated correlation system consists of three complementary correlation mechanisms based on two hypotheses of attack step relationship. The first hypothesis is that some attack steps are directly related because an earlier attack enables or positively affects the later one. We have developed a probabilistic-based correlation engine that incorporates domain knowledge to correlate alerts with direct causal relationship. The second hypothesis is that some related attack steps, even though they do not have obvious or direct (or known) relationship in terms of security and performance measures, still exhibit statistical and temporal patterns. For this category of relationship, we have developed two correlation engines to discover attack transition patterns based on statistical analysis and temporal pattern analysis, respectively. Based on the correlation results of these three correlation engines, we construct attack scenarios and conduct attack path analysis. The security analysts are presented with aggregated information on attack strategies from the integrated correlation system. We evaluate our approaches using DARPA's Grand Challenge Problem (GCP) data sets. Our evaluation shows that our approach can effectively discover novel attack strategies, provide a quantitative analysis of attack scenarios and identify attack plans. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Intrusion detection; Security alert correlation; Security management",""

We believe that early education will result a clever professional with skills tuned and toned to the real world needs. This paper discusses how cyber defense competitions offer to bridge the gap between in-class taught techniques and real world needs. It gives participants the opportunity to design their own network and then protect and defend it from outside attacks in a simulated environment. Furthermore, the paper sheds light on the importance of early education and awareness and its impact on future performance in the uncertainties of the information assurance age. We also would like to use this paper as framework to identify and meet educational goals in information assurance.","","Cybernetics; Education; Information science; Information technology; Cyber defense; Educational goals; Future networks; Future performance; Information assurance; Simulated environment; Network security"

The theory and practice of e-Government is on a top agenda in Russia, where ineffectiveness of public management has been a long-term problem. This research examines whether or not Russian efforts to enact e-Government are beneficial, and, if not, what could be done to improve the situation. Several instruments to implement forms of e-Government in Russia are analyzed, including Doctrine on Information Security, medium-term Program for social and economic development of Russia, and several target programs, like Electronic Russia (E-Russia). The analysis of legal norms and law enforcement practice brings to several findings. Firstly, the introduced scheme of e-Government is not in conformity with the outlines of the general administrative reform, which is underway in Russia since 2004. Secondly, there is no specific assignment of duties and clear division of powers between agencies, which are in charge of innovations in public sector-used information technologies. Thirdly, there is lack of coordination in the discussed area between federal, regional and local levels, whereas such coordination is crucial for the success of the reform in a large federal state like Russia. With these conclusions, the authors propose specific goals and indicators in various parts of public sector, introduction of which is required for successful implementation of e-Government in Russia. The authors also conclude what needs to be done to consolidate resources and powers to reach these goals and what legal norms, covering public management in the area of information technology innovations, need to be introduced or amended for the benefit of the e-Government reform.","E-Government; Federal state; Public services; Russia","Information technology; Security of data; Administrative reform; e-Government; Enforcement practices; Federal state; Information technology innovation; Public services; Russia; Social and economic development; Government data processing"

Incidents have varying degrees of impact, financial risk and learning opportunity for the organization. This variability naturally leads to classification of information security incidents into low and high priority for review and action. However, this classification carries with it some insidious aspects. First, high priority incidents are more costly to mitigate and as a consequence also more ""uncomfortable"" to report. Reporters may face reprimands, ridicule, extra workload and various other recriminations. This favors reporting of low priority incident at the expense of important high priority incidents. Incentives tied to reporting, a common policy used to stimulate reporting, may reinforce the problem. In essence, reporters face incentives and disincentives based on effects on throughput but have limited knowledge of what is important or not to the organization's security. Second, if a highly successful incident reporting policy is developed, the organization may become victim of its own success, as a growing volume of reports put increasingly higher pressure on incident handling resources. Continuously hiring more personnel is unsustainable in the long run. Developing and continuously improving automated tools for incident response promises more leverage.","Human factors; Incidents; Information security; Reporting systems; Security management","Classification (of information); Human engineering; Information management; Mobile security; Automated tools; Continuous improvements; Incident response; Incidents; Information security incidents; Learning opportunity; Reporting systems; Security management; Security of data"

Merely imparting instruction and hands on ""how-to"" information can sometimes put the instructor and potentially the educational institution at risk-as these tools and techniques for testing security are only a step removed from the methods and means of effecting security breaches or causing incidents. The need for training must therefore be balanced with the responsibility to provide an isolated and restrained environment in which to present material and hone new skills (or to use the vernacular-'skilz'). As a means of solving this, Virtual Machines (VM) and virtual network environments or team architectures offer a solution to these issues. They also provide, from an educational context, a set of 'known' problems and findings with which the student can study and develop the tools, techniques and knowledge to be an effective Information Assurance professional. This paper presents a series of architectures and scenarios proposed to effect such a learning environment that retains the viability of a 'real' network environment while providing an isolated and restricted learning area. This can be achieved through a series of scenarios and VM Team members (scenario players) in a virtual machine based learning environment. This approach allows a number of benefits: Isolation of the learning environment Restrict potential issues (DoS/attack signature detection) to a secured space Provide limits on tool and technique usage and impactLimit and mitigate risk and liability issues for the educational institution The VM environment also offers a unique opportunity to provide completely known interactions between the student and the learning environment-the software and the underlying virtual hardware. A detailed set of proposed scenarios and a learning environment architecture, including toolsets and targets of evaluation (TOE) systems is proposed. The applicability of the VM 'team' systems approach is discussed through a suite of scenarios designed to illustrate attack causation, monitoring, and detection.","Information assurance; Security education; Virtual systems","Computer aided instruction; Computer simulation; Network architecture; Personnel training; Students; Tools; Educational institutions; Information assurance; Learning environment architecture; Learning environments; Network environments; Security education; Tools and techniques; Virtual systems; E-learning"

These include detection and defense against attacks, detection of propagating viruses, evolution of intrusion systems, attacks at the physical, MAC and routing protoclols, trust establishment-dynamics-management. We demonstrate persistently that systems and control models and methodologies provide new and powerful techniques to analyze these problems. We describe the use of distributed change detection methods and algorithms for intrusion detection and the use of non-cooperative games for the detection and defense against attacks at all layers. We demonstrate how Bayesian decision theory can be used to evaluate intrusion detection systems and we resolve some key problems in this area. We use game theoretic methods again to develop robust protocols against attacks, including Byzantine ones. We provide an in-depth investigation of trust establishment and computation in such networks. We describe various methods for distributed trust evaluation and the associated trust (and mistrust) 'spreading' dynamics. We investigate rules and policies that establish 'trust-connexted' networks using only local interactions, and find the parameters (e.g. topology type) that speed up or slow down this transition. We describe and explain the phase transition phenomena that we have found in these evolutions. We model the interactions among agents as cooperative games and show that trust can encourage agents to collaborate. This leads us to a fundamental analytical technique, constrained coalitional games, that can be used to evaluate tradeoffs in collaborative networks in various areas: communications, sensors, economics, sociology, biology. We also describe a model for trust evaluation that uses pairwise iterated graph games between the agents to create a 'trust reputation' with evolution coupled to the game dynamics. Finally we present a new modeling framework for trust metric evaluation as linear iterations over ordered semirings. This allows us to formulate problems of resilience of trust metrics and trust evaluation to attacks. © 2007 EUCA.","Autonomic networks; Change detection; Dynamic games; Intrusion detection; Security; Semirings; Trust; Wireless","Computation theory; Computer viruses; Decision theory; Dynamics; Game theory; Network security; Problem solving; Viruses; Autonomic network; Change detection; Dynamic game; Intrusion-Detection; Security; Semi-ring; Systems and control; Trust; Trust establishment; Trust evaluation; Intrusion detection"

Recently, the design of secure protocols for wireless LANs has been placed under scrutiny to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of the communication. However, these protocols mostly focus on the protection of the ongoing communication only and neglect long-term security goals. Attack vectors against such long-term security goals include, but are not limited to adversaries that are eavesdropping the wireless communication to perform a post hoc cryptanalysis (possibly years after the data-capture). This paper introduces the paradigm of geographically secure routing to address the aforementioned shortcomings of existing security schemes. In particular, we propose a solution to transmit sensitive information in a mobile ad hoc network such that the routes are restricted to trustworthy nodes. Our scheme is able to prevent eavesdropping of or tampering with data in-flight, thus, thwarting passive and active attacks and supporting the long-term security of the system. We implement our solution using a cross-layer approach that builds on existing ad hoc routing protocols and maintains the compatibility with these protocols. A simulation study shows the feasibility of our approach and validates the proposed solution. © 2007 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","Communication; Mobile ad hoc networks; Security systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad hoc routing protocol; Cross-layer approach; Mobile and wireless communication; Passive and active attacks; Secure protocols; Sensitive informations; Simulation studies; Wireless communications; Security of data"

Explicit, end-to-end confidentiality and integrity policies can be given either as compile-time program annotations, or as run-time user requirements. Compile-time and run-time checking efficiently enforce these policies. Information flow analysis is known to be useful against SQL injection and cross-site scripting, but SIF prevents inappropriate use of information more generally: the flow of confidential information to clients is controlled, as is the flow of low-integrity information from clients. Expressive policies allow users and application providers to protect information from one another. SIF moves trust out of the web application, and into the framework and compiler. This provides application deployers with stronger security assurance. Language-based information flow promises cheap, strong information security. But until now, it could not effectively enforce information security in highly dynamic applications. To build SIF, we developed new language features that make it possible to write realistic web applications. Increased assurance is obtained with modest enforcement overhead. © 2007 USENIX Association.

Consequently, the storage space needed for the secret key generated by an elliptic curve dynamic access control system is smaller than that needed for the secret key generated by exponential operation built on the secure filter (SF) dynamic access control system. Using the elliptic curve to encrypt/decrypt on the secure filter improves the efficiency and security of using exponential operation on the secure filter in the dynamic access control system. With the proposed dynamic elliptic curve access control system, the trusted central authority (CA) can add/delete classes and relationships and change the secret keys at any time to achieve an efficient control and management. Furthermore, different possible attacks are used to analyze the security risks. Since attackers can only obtain the general equations for the elliptic curve dynamic access control system, they are unable to effectively perform an elliptic curve polynomial (ECP) conversion, or to solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Thus, the proposed elliptic curve dynamic access control system is secure.

In this paper, we present the results of a study of user behavioral intention toward protective technologies based on the framework of the theory of planned behavior. We find that awareness of the threats posed by negative technologies is a strong predictor of user behavioral intention toward the use of protective technologies. More interestingly, in the presence of awareness, the influence of subjective norm on individual behavioral intention is weaker among basic technology users but stronger among advanced technology users. Furthermore, while our results are consistent with many of the previously established relationships in the context of positive technologies, we find that the determinants ""perceived ease of use"" and ""computer self-efficacy"" are no longer significant in the context of protective technologies. We believe that this result highlights the most significant difference between positive technologies and protective technologies: while the former are used for their designed utilities, for which usefulness and ease of use have a significant impact, the latter are used out of fear of negative consequences, for which awareness becomes a key determinant. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. The findings of this study extend the theory of planned behavior to the context of protective technologies and shed insights on designing effective information security policies, practices, and protective technologies for organizations and society.

In this paper we propose a novel networking identity authentication scheme based on fingerprint coding method and Identity-based encryption (IBE). Fingerprint code is a dual-factor authenticator which combines a token, e.g USB key, with user's fingerprint feature by direct mixing of pseudo-random number generated by token and fingerprint feature. IBE allows for a sender to encrypt a message to a receiver without access to a public key certificate. This scheme can improve the security of user authentication and simplify comprehensive management of certificates, in the meantime, protect against fingerprint data fabrication and stolen. The security and efficiency of our proposed scheme meet the requirements of practical applications. © 2007 IEEE.","Identity authentication Fingerprint coding; Identity-based encryption; Information security","Authentication; Cryptography; Encoding (symbols); Feature extraction; Random number generation; Identity authentication Fingerprint coding; Identity based encryption; Pseudo-random number generation; Network security"

In this ambit this work takes place describing a new Intrusion Detection System based on anomaly approach. We realized a system with a hybrid solution between host-based and network-based approaches, and it consisted of two subsystems: a statistical system and a neural one. The features extracted from the network traffic belong only to the IP Header and their trend allows us detecting through a simple visual inspection if an attack occurred. Really the two-tier neural system has to indicate the status of the system. It classifies the traffic of the monitored host, distinguishing the background traffic from the anomalous one. Besides, a very important aspect is that the system is able to classify different instances of the same attack in the same class, establishing which attack occurs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","","Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Neural networks; Statistical methods; Telecommunication traffic; Visual communication; Background traffic; Decisional motor; Statistical systems; Discriminators"

Studies have found that a large percentage of security defects in e-business applications are due to design-related flaws, which could be detected and corrected during applications development. Traditional methods of managing software application vulnerabilities have often been ad hoc and inadequate. A recent approach that promises to be more effective is to incorporate security requirements as part of the application development cycle. However, there is limited practice of secure development of applications (SDA) and lack of research investigating the phenomenon. Motivated by such concerns, the goal of this research is to investigate the factors that may influence the intention of information systems (IS) professionals to practise SDA, i.e., incorporate security as part of the application development lifecycle. This study develops two models based on the widely used theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and theory of reasoned action (TRA) to explain the phenomenon. Following model operationalization, a field survey of 184 IS professionals was conducted to empirically compare the explanatory power of the TPB-based model versus the TRA-based model. Consistent with TPB and TRA predictions, attitude and subjective norm were found to significantly impact intention to practise SDA for the overall survey sample. Attitude was in turn determined by product usefulness and career usefulness of SDA, while subjective norm was determined by interpersonal influence, but not by external influence. Contrary to TPB predictions, perceived behavioural controls, conceptualized in terms of self-efficacy and facilitating conditions, had no significant effect on intention to practise SDA. Thus, a modified TRA-based model was found to offer the best explanation of behavioural intention to practise SDA. Implications for research and information security practice are suggested. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It aims to analyze the impact of the information revolution on international and domestic security; examine what existing international relations theories can say about this challenge; and discuss how international relations theory can be developed to better meet this challenge. The analysis suggests that Liberalism's focus on pluralism, interdependence and globalization, Constructivism's emphasis on language, symbols and images (including 'virtuality'), and some elements of Realist strategic studies (on the specific topic of information warfare) contribute to a better understanding of digital age security.

THE STORY: On January 4, 2006, Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Prime Minister was emergently admitted to the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem owing to a severe intracranial hemorrhage. Immediately following his admission, he underwent an extensive neurosurgical procedure to control the bleeding. Thereafter, he required intensive care for 5 months and underwent additional procedures. This admission presented organizational and administrative challenges. ORGANIZATION OF MEDICAL CARE: The major challenge was to provide the Prime Minister with the best medical care while avoiding the ""very important person syndrome"" and simultaneously continuing routine hospital activities. To coordinate his complicated medical management, a consultation forum was established composed of all the physicians directly involved in Mr. Sharon's care. Additionally, a senior intensivist was chosen to coordinate the medical care and, along with a physician from the hospital administration, assist with administrative issues. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS: Among the issues that the coordinating team addressed, with the help of many other hospital services, included patient confidentiality vs. public information, security of the patient's medical chart (including laboratory data and imaging), and coordination with security personnel. CONCLUSION: The acute care of a major governmental official requires the medical staff to address many administrative issues, while providing the ""very important person"" patient with appropriate intensive medical care.

From this analysis, a conceptual model of alignment is presented. This framework shows several organisational factors that can influence alignment. Design/methodology/approach - A number of published works on alignment are discussed in order to develop a conceptual model of IA fit. In addition, Venkatraman's six perspectives of alignment are used as a framework to suggest future research in this area. Findings - The paper presents a definition of information assurance and proposes various reasons why IA is a strategic issue and should be aligned with both IT and corporate strategy. From the literature, a conceptual model illustrating the variables that can influence alignment is presented. Research limitations/implications - A clear conceptualisation of alignment is needed. Six potential research models and associated research questions are proposed. Practical implications - The paper concludes with a number of management and research implications. In looking at the implications for managers, it is argued that any alignment framework should include adequate metrics for checking the strategic fit on a continuous basis. Originality/value - This paper is an initial attempt to fulfil an identified gap in the literature, namely the lack of research undertaken on IA and corporate strategy alignment. It offers practical help for management so that they can improve the fit between IA and business strategy.

This paper offers a modular solution to the security of multithreaded programs. The modularity is three-fold: we give modular extensions of sequential semantics, sequential security typing, and sequential security-type preserving compilation that allow us enforcing security for multithreaded programs.

Even though both the semantics are required they are insufficient for handling emerging applications such as information security, stream and sensor data processing systems.

Second, operating environments of the anomaly detectors reveal different information about system anomalies. The correlation among observation-specific anomaly detectors is first formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, and then a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm is developed for an optimal cooperation search, with the practical objectives being broader overall detection coverage and fewer false alerts.

Design/methodology/approach - Information security principles, legal and ethical concerns are amalgamated that surround security testing and components of generic security testing methodologies that can be applied to VoIP. A simple model is created of a business infrastructure (core network) for the delivery of enterprise VoIP services and the selected tests are applied through a methodically structured action plan. Findings - The main output of this paper is a, documented in detail, testing plan (audit programme) for the security review of a core VoIP enterprise network infrastructure. Also, a list of recommendations for good testing practice based on the testing experience and derived through the phase of the methodology evaluation stage. Research limitations/implications - The methodology in the paper does not extend at the moment to the testing of the business operation issues of VoIP telephony, such as revenue assurance or toll fraud detection. Practical implications - This approach facilitates the conduct or security reviews and auditing in a VoIP infrastructure. Originality/value - VoIP requires appropriate security testing before its deployment in a commercial environment. A key factor is the security of the underlying data network. If the business value of adopting VoIP is considered then the potential impact of a related security incident becomes clear. This highlights the need for a coherent security framework that includes means for security reviews, risk assessments, and influencing design and deployment. In this respect, this approach can meet this requirement. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Auditing; Communication technologies; Internet; Tests and testing",""

E-enabled airplanes with wired and wireless network interfaces offer a wide spectrum of network applications, in particular electronic distribution of software (EDS), and onboard collection and off-board retrieval of airplane health reports. On the other hand, airplane safety may be heavily dependent on the security of data transported in these applications. The FAA mandates safety regulations and policies for the design and development of airplane software to ensure continued airworthiness. However, data networks have well known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to corrupt and/or inhibit the transmission of airplane assets, i.e. software and airplane generated data. The aviation community has recognized the need to address these security threats.

These systems could replace conventional mono-modal biometric methods using two or more features for robust biometric authentication tasks. They employ unique combinations of measurable physical characteristics: fingerprint, facial features, iris of the eye, voice print, hand geometry, vein patterns, and so on. Since these traits are hardly imitable by other persons, the aim of these multibiometric systems is to achieve a high reliability to determine or verify person's identity. In this paper a multimodal biometric system using two different fingerprints is proposed. The matching module integrates fuzzy logic methods for matching score fusion.

The framework shows how significant risks can be identified, assessed and treated. It also explains the measures that can be taken to mitigate or 'treat' the risk exposure of the organisation for the future. The risk framework will provide a common language, which can be used by all of the parties that are involved in the process, from the members of the board, through the security and audit staffs, to the end users of the systems, as a vehicle for communication and improved understanding.

Even if uncertainty has been widely touted as the primary barrier to online transactions, the literature has viewed uncertainty as a ""background"" mediator with insufficient conceptualization and measurement. To better understand the nature of uncertainty and mitigate its potentially harmful effects on B2C e-commerce adoption (especially for important purchases), this study draws upon and extends the principal-agent perspective to identify and propose a set of four antecedents of perceived uncertainty in online buyer-seller relationships - perceived information asymmetry, fears of seller opportunism, information privacy concerns, and information security concerns - which are drawn from the agency problems of adverse selection (hidden information) and moral hazard (hidden action). To mitigate uncertainty in online exchange relationships, this study builds upon the principal - agent perspective to propose a set of four uncertainty mitigating factors - trust, website informativeness, product diagnosticity, and social presence - that facilitate online exchange relationships by overcoming the agency problems of hidden information and hidden action through the logic of signals and incentives. The proposed structural model is empirically tested with longitudinal data from 521 consumers for two products (prescription drugs and books) that differ on their level of purchase involvement. The results support our model, delineating the process by which buyers engage in online exchange relationships by mitigating uncertainty. Interestingly, the proposed model is validatedfor two distinct targets, a specific website and a class of websites. Implications for understanding and facilitating online exchange relationships for different types of purchases, mitt gating uncertainty perceptions, and extending the principal-agent perspective are discussed.","Adverse selection; Agency theory; Fears of seller opportunism; Hidden action; Hidden information; Information asymmetry; Information privacy; Information security; Moral hazard; Product diagnosticiry; Social presence; Trust; Uncertainty; Website informativeness","Information dissemination; Mathematical models; Online searching; Online systems; Security of data; Websites; Hidden information; Information asymmetry; Information privacy; Product diagnosticiry; Electronic commerce"

A client application helps guide the user at the point of executing software on the local computer, displaying other users' feedback about the expected behaviour of the software. We discuss important aspects to consider when constructing such a system, and propose possible solutions.

Generalized signcryption is an adaptive primitive which achieves both secrecy and authenticity or provides them respectively by a generic structure. The notions related to generalized signcryption such as syntax, correctness, and security are proposed in the paper. A practical generalized signcryption scheme ECGSC is evaluated carefully also. The formal proofs for the unforgeability and confidentiality of ECGSC in the Random Oracle model are provided. To give a solution for multiple user settings, an efficient multicast scheme is also designed. ECGSC will seamlessly switch to the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) or a provable secure asymmetric encryption scheme when recipient's keys or sender's keys are absent. Compared with other schemes, it saves 9-14% communication costs in the signcryption mode. It also saves 78-82% computational costs.

We are also employing remote sensing technologies with high-spatial and spectral resolution to model urban pollution using satellite images and image processing. One of the objectives of this investigation is to develop a unique capability to acquire, display and assimilate these valuable sources of data to accurately assess urban pollution by real-time monitoring using commercial sensors fabricated using nanofabrication technologies and satellite imagery. This integrated tool will be beneficial towards prediction processes to support public awareness and establish policy priorities for air quality in polluted areas.

Greater coordination problems are associated with size, distance, interdependence, and scientific competition. Problems of culture and security are associated with size, distance, scientific competition, and commercialization. Email use is associated with reporting fewer coordination problems, but not fewer problems of culture and security, while neither phone use nor face-to-face meetings significantly reduces problems.

The proposed framework enables an agent to choose among alternatives in an optimal fashion, taking into account the worth of acquiring prior information to reduce uncertainty.

However, there is evidence that these reviews do not happen as often as recommended. Here, we investigate the kinds of triggers, that can cause an organisation to review its information security policy and policy implementation. We also examine which actors are involved in the information security change process and what form such change takes. The research is based on 26 structured interviews carried out in Sweden and the UK.

The limited attention to BPO risks is not surprising since over 90% of the outsourcing projects still handle IT infrastructure or business processes for what most companies regard as non-core activities, such as payroll, transaction processing, and billing. This article provides an overview of the different types of risks that a BPO client is faced with, including the damaging impact to client companies in areas such as customer services, overall operations costs, information security, business continuity, and other short-term market performance metrics. In an attempt to address this issue, this article introduces a mechanism by which BPO clients and vendors can work together to solve outsourcing project management problems and manage the organizational and market performance risks.","",""

We assume the area between the IT device and the receiver is a communication channel, and we define the amount of information leakage via electromagnetic emanations by its channel capacity. By some experimental results of Tempest, we show example estimations of amount of information leakage.

Their scheme is very efficient and the sizes of signatures are smaller than those of the other existing schemes. In this paper, we point out that Nguyen and Safavi-Naini's scheme is insecure.

The AAA mechanism is information security technology that systematically provides authentication, authorization and accounting functions, not only in the existing wire network but also in the rapidly developing ubiquitous network, with various ubiquitous services and protocol. Currently, IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force) AAA Working Group deals with about secure AAA protocol in ubiquitous network and studies methods that offer secure authentication through mobility of Mobile Nodes. Therefore, in this paper, the AAAH(Home Authentication Server) authenticates the Mobile device. After that, it uses a ticket issued from AAAH, even if the device moves to a foreign network, and can provide service in foreign network without accessing by AAAH.

Drawing from deterrence theory and using the theory of planned behavior as a general framework, this empirical field study investigated the effects of punishment and ethics training on behaviors related to contravention of Information security measures among information professionals to fill an important gap in the literature. We found that both punishment and ethics training can be effective in mitigating the threat of software and information security, but that these depend on certain underlying motivational factors of individuals.

However, the level of protection of information is often much higher than it is necessary to meet potential threats.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on a literature review, a model of the relationship between organizational culture and ISM was formulated, and both organizational culture characteristics and ISM effectiveness were measured empirically to investigate how various organizational culture traits influenced ISM principles, by administrating questionnaires to respondents in organizations with significant use of information systems. Findings - Four regression models were derived to quantify the impacts of organizational culture traits on the effectiveness of implementing ISM. Whilst the control-oriented organizational culture traits, effectiveness and consistency, have strong effect on the ISM principles of confidentiality, integrity, availability and accountability, the flexibility-oriented organizational culture traits, cooperativeness and innovativeness, are not significantly associated with the ISM principles with one exception that cooperativeness is negatively related to confidentiality. Research limitations/implications - The sample is limited to the organizational factors in Taiwan. It is suggested to replicate this study in other countries to reconfirm the result before adopting its general implications. Owing to the highly intrusive nature of ISM surveys, a cautious approach with rapport and trust is a key success factor in conducting empirical studies on ISM. Practical implications - A culture conducive to information security practice is extremely important for organizations since the human dimension of information security cannot totally be solved by technical and management measures. For understanding and improving the organization behavior with regard to information security, enterprises may look into organizational culture and examine how it affects the effectiveness of implementing ISM. Originality/value - A research model was proposed to study the impacts of organizational factors on ISM, after a broad survey on related researches. The validated model and its corresponding study results can be referenced by enterprise managers and decision makers to make favorable tactics for achieving their goals of ISM - mitigating information security risks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Data security; Information systems; Organizational culture","Decision making; Information management; Information systems; Managers; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Societies and institutions; Information security management; Innovativeness; Organizational culture; Questionnaires; Security of data"

This paper uses subject and permission that are common in different access control models to describe administration scope, abstracts interface between administration model and access control model to policy* functions and proposes a generic administration model. The model introduces the concept of management space that corresponds with real enterprise structure and makes the model easily understood by managers, and the administration tasks are achieved hierarchically.

Our survey reveals that most information security research has focused on the technical context, and on issues of access to IS and secure communication. The corresponding security issues have been resolved by using mathematical approaches as a research approach. The reference disciplines most commonly reflected have been mathematics, including philosophical logic. Based on this analysis, we suggest new directions for studying information security from an information systems viewpoint, with respect to research methodology and research questions.

Since sampling entails incurring network costs for real-time packet sampling and packet examination hardware, a network packet sampling strategy is developed to detect network intrusions effectively while not exceeding the velocity of the packet examination. This problem is considered in a game theoretic framework and a sampling scheme that is optimal in game theory setting by the Minimax theorem and the max-flow min-cut theorem is developed. The method of risk management is also introduced and the solution is extend to more complex cases to solve the choice of sampling strategy while facing more various environments.","Game theory approach; Intrusion detection; Risk management; Sampling strategy","Facings; Game theory; Intrusion detection; Security of data; Velocity; Game theory approach; Sampling strategy; Risk management"

The main areas have been concentrating on public safety and security, but VTT is also participating in several research projects related to defence technology. To identify and define expertise and research goals in more detail, the Security research roadmap was developed. The roadmap identified three particularly significant areas related to security. The assurance of a critical infrastructure emphasises the protection of energy networks, information networks, water supply, traffic and transport, and obviously also the citizens. For assuring the activities of entrepreneurship, significant areas include the security of production and services, the security of sites and assets, and information security for embedded systems. The most important security products and technologies needed are, for example, management of total security, detection, identification, localisation and communication, protection of information networks and systems, as well as physical protection. In the EU's Security programme, which aims at ensuring the security of society and its vital functions, it is stated that ""Technology alone can not assure security, but security can not be assured without the support of technology."" VTT is conducting security research in all its areas of expertise and clusters. The area has a significant research potential. The development of products and systems designed for the improvement of security has just started. There is still room for innovation.

The three-layer business on which manufacturers should also focus to create a business enabling approach to security, include information security, IT department, and the organization as a whole.","",""

In the enterprise network terminals, they were not allowed to leak sensitive information outside the enterprise application environment for the reason of confidentiality. While in the reality, these information can be leaked outside in the following ways, 1) with floppy disk, USB disk and so on, 2) first printed with printers, and then taken away, and 3) with all kinds of network devices. But unfortunately, there is not a reasonable solution, which can maintain the availability of the system while protecting the confidentiality of sensitive information. In view of this reality, an intranet information disclosure defendable security model based on crypt-isolation is proposed, in which the process's behavior is monitored, and its security level is adjusted dynamically. When a high level process wants to write information to a media that is liable to leak the information outside, the system will encrypt the information automatically. As a result, the user's behavior is controlled, and no sensitive information can be leaked, intentionally or unintentionally. Furthermore, in order to achieve crypt-isolation, a new key management solution is presented. Combined with the existing symmetric encryption algorithms, this key management solution can provide one person encryption and specified people decryption ability, which is very worthy.","Access control; Crypt-isolation; Information leakage; Process control; Virtual classified network","Access control; Computer networks; Cryptography; Intranets; Process control; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Crypt isolation; Decryption; Encryption; Enterprise; Enterprise application environment; Floppy disk; Information leakage; Key management; Network device; Network terminal; Printer; USB disk; Virtual classified network; Network security"

The security community has proposed several disclosure mechanisms, such as full vendor, immediate public, and hybrid, and has debated about the merits and demerits of these alternatives. In this paper, we study how vulnerabilities should be disclosed to minimize the social loss. We find that the characteristics of the vulnerability (vulnerability risk before and after disclosure), cost structure of the software user population, and vendor's incentives to develop a patch determine the optimal (responsible) vulnerability disclosure. We show that, unlike some existing vulnerability disclosure mechanisms that fail to motivate the vendor to release its patch, responsible vulnerability disclosure policy always ensures the release of a patch. However, we find that this is not because of the threat of public disclosure, as argued by some security practitioners. In fact, not restricting the vendor with a time constraint can ensure the patch release. This result runs counter to the argument of some that setting a grace period always pushes the vendor to develop a patch. When the vulnerability affects multiple vendors, we show that the responsible disclosure policy cannot ensure that every vendor will release a patch. However, when the optimal policy does elicit a patch from each vendor, we show that the coordinator's grace period in the multiple vendor case falls between the grace periods that it would set individually for the vendors in the single vendor case. This implies that the coordinator does not necessarily increase the grace period to accommodate more vendors. We then extend our base model to analyze the impact of 1) early discovery and 2) an early warning system that provides privileged vulnerability knowledge to selected users before the release of a patch for the vulnerability on responsible vulnerability disclosure. We show that while early discovery always improves the social welfare, an early warning system does not necessarily improve the social welfare. © 2007 IEEE.","Disclosure mechanisms; Economic modeling; Game theory; Information security; Responsible vulnerability disclosure; Software vulnerabilities","Data privacy; Economic and social effects; Game theory; Information dissemination; Knowledge management; Disclosure mechanisms; Economic modelling; Software vulnerability; Vulnerability disclosure; Computer privacy"

Deleting invalid policies makes the policies created by attackers applicable in making access request decision so that policy decision point can resist such DoS attack. In XACML administrative policy, the delegation element process is different with elements in XACML. It is recognized as a bug in XACML administrative policy. An improved policy schema definition is presented to correct the bugs, which makes the processing of delegations be in conformance with the elements of subject, resources, etc in XACML core, and defines administrative policies more efficiently. Through these improvements, the performance of making decision is accelerated.

There are three kinds of governance concept which should be considered in corporate environments: enterprise governance, IT governance, and security governance. The success factors of the governance are summarized: Adequate participation by business management; Clearly defined governance processes; Clarify stakeholders' roles; Measure the effectiveness of governance; Facilitate the evolution of governance; Clearly articulated goals; Resolution of cultural issues. The approaches of security management, which manage an organization's security policy by monitoring and controlling security services and mechanisms, distribute security information, and report security events, are related with the purpose of security governance. However, studies on enterprise governance or IT governance, and security management lack in the provision of detailed framework and functionalities when considering the success factors of the governance described above. For example, BS7799, which is one of the most famous standards of security management in the world, provides general guidance on the wide variety of information security. Nevertheless, it takes the broad-brush approach. Accordingly, BS7799 does not provide definitive or specific materials on any topic of the security management and certainly could be useful as a high-level overview of information security topics that could help senior management to understand the basic issues involved in each of the topic areas. This chapter provides a structured approach of security governance to corporate executives. Previous studies on the governance and security management are summarized to explain the components and requirements of a governance framework for corporate security. Finally, a governance framework for corporate security, which consists of four domains and two relationship categories, is provided. The domains have several objects respectively. The objects consist of components that should be resolved or provided to govern the issues of corporate security. The domains include a community (shareholder and management; media and customer; employee and supplier; government), security (control; enterprise strategy), performance (resource; competitive value), and information (owner; value; risk). The relationship among the objects of the security governance framework has two categories of harmonization and flywheel. The harmonization category governs the relationship among a community, performance, and security domain. The harmonization category deals with the problems of social, organizational, and human factors of corporate security. The flywheel category governs the relationship between a performance domain and security domain. The flywheel category deals with the virtuous cycle of corporate security. With this framework, corporate executives could create greater productivity gains, cost efficiencies, and a safer business community internally, for their customers and others interconnected throughout the critical infrastructure. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","",""

We describe a possible method for securing holographic information by digital encoding of the Fresnel field.

The analogy between the decryption process and the numerical reconstruction of the hologram leads to a single-step reconstruction of the complex object field from the encrypted Fresnel field, thus saving computational power. The use of a single off-axis hologram is helpful in zero-order and twin-image free reconstruction. The algorithm is explained with experimental results to support the proof of the concept. © 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","Digital encryption; Digital holography; Digital optics; Fourier transform; Optical encryption; Three-dimensional (3-D) image processing","Computer simulation; Encoding (symbols); Fourier optics; Fourier transforms; Holograms; Information retrieval; Security of data; Digital encoding; Digital Fresnel field; Fourier plane encoding; Noise-like distribution; Cryptography"

It has numerous commercial and law-enforcement applications including video surveillance, information security and entertainment [1]. One of the main advantages of face recognition, when compared to other identification techniques, is its non-intrusivness. This means that users are not asked for any kind of cooperation while the system identifies them and may even fail to notice that the identification process is running. In this paper we present an algorithm for registration and normalization of digital face images. Using this algorithm we can either improve the recognition rate or make recognition possible in cases where this was not possible before. In the first phase we have to detect faces on the image. This is achieved by using a face detector that implements a set of Harr-like features and AdaBoost learning algorithm [5], [6]. In the next phase we have to detect selected characteristic points of the detected face, such as eyes. The proposed algorithm improves eye detection by transforming images from the RGB color space to YCbCr. In that space it can be seen that the eye area consists of pixels that have high Cb component value and pixels that have low Cr component value. By thresholding each channel using different thresholds and logically combining them, a mask which presents potential eyes objects is obtained. These objects are then accepted or rejected using contour analysis. Potential eye objects are accepted by minimizing objective function, which takes the contour size and position for input parameters. When the eye coordinates are known, the face image can be trasformed into a coordinate space, created using these coordinates, by using methods such as shift and scale and rotation transformation. To further increase the face recognition rate, the images are photometrically normalized using histogram equalization. Once the image is processed using the proposed method, we can use it in the recognition process. In order to test the efficiency of the proposed method, we use the face recognition algorithm based on PCA [2], [3], [4] and test it on registered and non-registered face images from two different databases. The results show that by using image registration and normalization it is possible to significantly increase the recognition rate. From 68.9%, when using unregistered images from AR database without color normalization, to 88.5% when using registered images from the same database with color normalization. The highest recognition rate of 96.2% was achieved using registered and normalized face images from Frontal Face image database.","Eyes detection; Face detection; Face recognition; Image registration","Algorithms; Electronic document identification systems; Image quality; Image registration; Law enforcement; Color normalization; Eyes detection; Face recognition rate; Identification processes; Face recognition"

In this paper, we extend the existing RBAC model and propose the SC-RBAC model that utilizes spatial and location-based information in security policy definitions. The concept of spatial role is presented, and the role is assigned a logical location domain to specify the spatial boundary. Roles are activated based on the current physical position of the user which obtained from a specific mobile terminal. We then extend SC-RBAC to deal with hierarchies, modeling permission, user and activation inheritance, and prove that the hierarchical spatial roles are capable of constructing a lattice which is a means for articulate multi-level security policy and more suitable to control the information flow security for safety-critical location-aware information systems. Next, constrained SC-RBAC allows express various spatial separations of duty constraints, location-based cardinality and temporal constraints for specify fine-grained spatial semantics that are typical in location-aware systems. Finally, we introduce 9 invariants for the constrained SC-RBAC and its basic security theorem is proven. The constrained SC-RBAC provides the foundation for applications in need of the constrained spatial context aware access control. © Science in China Press 2007.","Constraints; Formal model; Information security; Lattice; MLS; RBAC; Spatial context",""

Examples of such applications abound in the domains of medicine, entertainment, manufacturing, e-commerce, as well as military and critical national infrastructures. Development of DMIS for such applications need a broad range of technological solutions for organizing, storing, and delivering multimedia information in an integrated, secure and timely manner with guaranteed end-to-end (E2E) quality of presentation (QoP). DMIS are viewed as catalysts for new research in many areas, ranging from basic research to applied technology. This view is a result of the fact that no single monolithic end-to-end architecture for DMIS can meet the wide spectrum of characteristics and requirements of various Web-based multimedia applications. One size does not fit all in this medium of communication. Management of integrated end-to-end QoP and ensuring information security in DMIS, when viewed in conjunction with real world constraints and system-wide performance requirements, present formidable research and implementation challenges. These challenges encompass all the sub-system components of a DMIS. The ultimate objective of achieving a comprehensive end-to-end QoP management relies on the performance and allocation of resources of each of the DMIS sub-system components including networks, databases, and end-systems.

The analysis indicates that coercive, normative, and mimetic isomorphic processes were evident, although it was difficult to distinguish normative from mimetic influences. Two internal forces related to work practices were identified representing resistance to initiatives to improve security: the institutionalization of work mobility and the institutionalization of efficiency outcomes expected with the adoption of company initiatives, especially those involving information technology. The interweaving of top-down and bottom-up influences resulted in an effort to reinforce, and perhaps reinstitutionalize the systems component of information security. The success of this effort appeared to hinge on top management championing information system security initiatives and propagating an awareness of the importance of information security among employees at all levels of the company.

In this paper, we model two important managerial decisions involved in the intrusion prevention process: the configuration of the detection component, and the response by the reaction component. The configuration decision affects the number of alarms the firm has to investigate. It is well known that the traditional intrusion detection system generates too many false alarms. The response decision determines whether alarms are going to be investigated or rejected outright. By jointly optimizing these two decision variables, a firm may apply different strategies in protecting its informational assets: slow but accurate, rapid but inaccurate, or a mixture of the two strategies. We use the optimal control approach to study the problem. Unlike previous literature, which studied the problem with a static model, in our model, the decision on balancing the desire to detect all malicious events with the opportunity costs required to do so is time dependent. Furthermore, we show how the choice of an optimal mixture of reactive and proactive responses depends on the values of cost parameters and investigation rate parameters. We find that in our model, a high damage cost does not immediately translate to a preference of proactive response, or a high false rejection cost does not translate to a preference of reactive response. The dynamics of the problem, such as how fast alarms accumulate and how fast they can be cleared, also affect the decisions. © 2007 M.E.

In addition, according to this strategy, a monitor system is also designed based on the Intel IXP2400 chip. Experimental results show that, by virtue of the powerful processing ability of IXP2400, the monitor system could efficiently process high-speed data stream in Gb/s-net.","Information leakage; Intel IXP2400; Monitor system; Security strategy","Access control; Communication; Intranets; Security of data; Data stream; Host computer; Information leakage; Information security; Intel IXP2400 chip; Monitor system; Physical connection; Resource utility; Security strategy; Network security"

Justin describes certification as a ""flawed process"" but admits it can be useful in applying for jobs. He believes technical certifications are difficult to create so they have practical application. He calls for an IT security review board equivalent to the law exam for lawyers. On laptop security he believes easy to use encryption is best for end-users. He recommends PGP as it is user friendly and transparent. He says one of the most basic laptop security controls is a cable lock, which he uses everywhere. Justin says wireless networking is still part of the ""golden age of hacking."" He says ""fantastic"" security controls are available for securing wireless access points and wireless clients. He has encountered organizations with no awareness of rogue access points or any means of detecting rogue devices. He says old attacks are still mostly used today where common tools such as airsnort and kismet are used against Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). He describes client side exploits as the newest wave of attacks saying they leave him ""scared about security controls."" He admits the attacks are difficult to prevent and says deep pack inspection is the only measure that works somewhat. He is also fearful of:. TOR - Packets travelling across the TOR are impossible to trace back. Anti-forensics (AF) - AF makes hiding an attack easier. Steganography - Combining steg with anti-forensics makes finding an attacker impossible. SSL- SSL is a popular attack vector. This year, every other month, War & Peace in Cyberspace will feature ""Profiles in Cyber Courage."" In this ongoing series, we will focus on colleagues who have made significant contributions to the field of cybersecurity, and conduct in-depth interviews on timely and vital issues. Our second ""Profile in Cyber Courage"" highlights Tom and Justin Peltier (http://www.peltierassociates.com), who along with many individual accomplishments share the distinction of being the first father and son to win the CISSP and CISM certifications.

Anti-forensic behaviour is by no means something new on the information security scene: all attackers attempt to erase or disguise the traces of their intrusion and try to make the investigator's work as difficult as possible. Techniques used to elude computer forensics operations range from the simple deletion of log files to the installation of advanced and nearly invisible rootkits at the system level. The nature and degree of the difficulties faced by an investigator depend on the specific case, but there is no question that the task is becoming generally more difficult as time goes on. According to many experts, anti-forensic actions accompany two out of three attacks. This is a worrisome percentage, especially considering the exponential increase in attacks seen in recent years directed both towards public/governmental targets, and towards the business sector, where most of the resources are. The main objective of anti-forensic actions is to eliminate digital evidence or at least render such evidence unusable for legal purposes. Another objective is to throw investigators off track by modifying the evidence so that it leads to the wrong conclusions. An investigator always has to consider and examine every aspect of the situation in order to avoid falling into traps. This is the first in a series of three articles where we take a look at the traits, potentials and limitations of an often underestimated or merely rumoured category of malicious software. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study evaluated the time and number of attempts needed to generate unique passwords satisfying different restrictions for multiple accounts, as well as the login time and accuracy for recalling those passwords. Imposing password restrictions alone did not necessarily lead to more secure passwords.

Too many software developers rarely think about licensing issues when downloading a ""good piece of free code"" or a ""free application"".

In this work we focus on non-linearity related criteria and explore a multiobjective evolutionary approach aiming to find several balanced functions of similar characteristics satisfying multiple criteria.

As defense resources are limited, we propose effective resource allocation strategies that maximize an attacker's costs and minimize the probability that the ""core node"" of a network will be compromised, thereby improving its protection. The two problems are analyzed as a mixed, nonlinear, integer programming optimization problem. The solution approach is based on the Lagrangean Relaxation method, which solves this complicated problem effectively.

Based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions, a swift trust model is proposed in which the mechanism of swift trust is realized by way of layered reasoning, which is superior to the typical trust reasoning. The model puts forward a trust-transfer mechanism and clustering mechanism to achieve a whole swift trust value. The reliability of swift trust in developing and maintaining temporary systems is discussed, together with the reliability of the swift trust values derived from the proposed approach.

However, benefits of interconnectivity are not gained without risk, as IT has removed protective barriers around assets and processes. Thus, supply chains are better able to satisfy customer needs yet are potentially more vulnerable to disruption due to an array of IT-specific threats. Highly interconnected supply chains would appear to be especially prone to these hazards. Although supply chain risk and information technology risk have been studied in isolation, little has been done to define the impact of information security on supply chain management. This exploratory investigation addresses this deficiency in the literature by defining information security risk in the context of supply chain management. It identifies, categorizes, and validates information technology threats as sources of risk in the supply chain. It then establishes a conceptual framework for further study into supply chain information security risk. Finally, it discusses the implications of information security risk in the supply chain. It is suggested that supply chain risk is affected by IT threats and therefore the benefits of collaboration facilitated by IT integration must exceed the increase in risk due to IT security threats.","Information security; Risk; Supply chain management","Information technology; Integration; Risk analysis; Security of data; Information security risk; IT-specific threats; Protective barriers; Supply chain management"

They are in fact vulnerable. As such, there is now a growing interest in ensuring that systems are secured. One useful guide is the ISA's Technical Report ISA-TR99.00.02-2004 Integrating Electronic Security into the Manufacturing and Control Systems Environment. There are also mitigation measures that can be followed. For instance, an inventory of networked control devices must be developed and the creation of an outline of the key devices on the network through network diagrams of the control network system. There are also tools, such as vulnerability assessment (VA) scanning tools determine if devices attached to the network are correctly configured and patched. An assessment report will then be made from the surveying of the various concerns and gaps, if found then compared with current best practices. On the other hand, protective measures are also a helpful tool. In order to ensure security implementations crossing IT/process boundaries, there will be a need to improve the communication and execution of security solutions between the IT group and the control engineers in the process area. Although looked at as unnecessary, unnecessary services and applications from process control computer must be removed including which may only increase the opportunities for a hacker or virus to exploit the system.","","Electric power plants; Electric power system protection; Electric power transmission networks; Interconnection networks; Process control; SCADA systems; Security systems; Cybersecurity; Networked control devices; Vulnerability assessment (VA) scanning tools; Electric power systems"

This paper outlines what these changes mean for acquiring degrees in information security and how various universities have tried to respond to these demands. What is unclear at this stage is how the offering of continuous master degrees at Polytechnic and Applied Science Universities will affect the content and curriculum being taught in computer science and information security in particular. This question must be addressed since polytechnics are more industry focused and less research oriented than their university-counterparts. What seems to be clear at this stage is that continuous type master programs in computer science demand a greater level of mathematical knowledge than specialized masters. Moreover, due to the amount of credits that must be acquired, graduates of these types of programs will bring a deeper knowledge about the specialization such as, information security or malware, they acquired at university. This movement toward greater convergence in post secondary education may not have made things easier for recruiters, who are trying to hire graduates in information security or anti-virus experts. In fact, as this paper shows while the Bologna process may have eliminated the obvious differences, countless intricate and not so obvious differences have been added making it sometimes obscure for a bystander. © Springer-Verlag France 2007.","","Computer viruses; Education; Network security; Bystander; Master degrees; Post secondary education; Information dissemination"

The need for more modern data sets has led researchers to consider ways to generate test data for evaluating their own IDS design. The MIT Lincoln Lab evaluators have created Lariat, the Lincoln Adaptable Real-time Information Assurance Testbed for IDS evaluation. This system can generate realistic background traffic and real-time attacks and offers a graphical interface for configuration and monitoring.

Therefore, the success of a VE relies on full information transparency and appropriate resource sharing, making security and trust among subjects significant issues. Trust evaluation to ensure information security is most complicated in a VE involving cross-organization collaboration. This study presents a virtual enterprise access control (VEAC) model to enable resource sharing for collaborative operations in the VE. A scenario for authentication and authorization in the life cycle of a VE is then described to identify the main activities for controlling access. Also developed herein is a trust evaluation method based on the VEAC model to improve its security while safeguarding sensitive resources to support collaborative activities. The trust evaluation method involves two trust evaluation sub-models, one to evaluate the level of trust between two virtual enterprise roles, and another to measure the level of trust between two projects. The two sub-models support each other to make resource-sharing decisions, and are developed based on the concepts of direct, indirect, and negative trust factors. Finally, an example of measuring the trust between two subjects is demonstrated after introducing the two sub-models.

The risks in cybersecurity are increasing rapidly in our country. Because the cybersecurity defenses and computer crime investigation systems of our government and businesses have been threatened, the damage of cybercrime for national security and public security will become more critical, even more than violent crime and economic crime. The national cyber forensics mechanism and laboratory will play a crucial role in dealing with cybercrime. In 2003, our government conducted a research of digital evidence, the standard procedure of the operations and cyber forensic laboratory. It included the organization, training, technical capability, legislation, and operation procedures. In 2004, our government made a policy to build the first nationwide cyber security and forensic laboratory. It will be one of the major cybersecurity defense mechanisms in Taiwan. Our bureau (MJIB) made a plan and got the additional budget to build a cyber forensic lab this year [1]. This study has four aspects: 1) The study of reliable cyber forensic software and hardware; 2) The standard of the operating procedures of cyber forensics; 3) Training courses for the examiner, including an internationally well-known certification system in cyber forensics; and 4) The study of certification for the cyber forensic laboratory. Cyber forensics is still in its early stages in Taiwan. More professional cyber forensic manpower is needed, as well as a certified cyber forensic mechanism. It is expected that cyber forensics will become increasingly important for cybersecurity policy [1] and management in the future. Hence, building a certificated laboratory and establishing the SOP of cyber forensics from this study can be the basis to cultivate cyber forensic capabilities in our country. In this way, law enforcement will get more help from our laboratory. The laboratory, through its operation, also enhances the ability of Taiwan's cyber forensic professionals and provides more convincing digital evidence in court. Furthermore, it can consolidate cybersecurity systems and the e-Taiwan environment. © 2007 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Information management; Law enforcement; Risk assessment; Cyber forensic laboratory; Cybersecurity; Digital evidence; Security of data"

SMC is also called secure function evaluation, which is extensively studied in classical cryptography. SMC protocol allows n participants p1...pn to compute an n-input data through trusted third party (TTP) without revealing the information of the parties. AU the parties may perform secure communication with TTP for computation. During the computation, TTP may undesirably extract data of all the parties for misuse. It may be risky if the data is sent out. To achieve security in SMC, numbers of solutions are available, but they use cryptography as secure communication between the parties and not for the computation. Basically cryptography is used for the secure communication but in our protocol, we use it for the secure communication as well as for computation. TTP computes entire encrypted data received by all the parties without being aware that the data is encrypted so that if data is disclosed by TTP to others even than no one can reveal the actual data of the party. In this protocol, we have tried to remove the concept of hiding the data using anonymizer. Our earlier protocol uses the anonymizer between parties and TTP to hide the identity of parties. Even after enforcing all these securities, the anonymizer can become malicious, causing leakage of data. To prevent this, we require some additional measures. Thus we propose a new cryptographic protocol that causes a secure communication between the parties and the TTP as well as perform secure computation using encryption. The protocol uses a polynomial to encrypt data by party itself before sending to TTP for computation. It also embeds some dummy data at random places. The purpose of dummy data is to check the honesty of TTP because result of dummy data is known to the party. All the data send to TTP is in the form of numbers as it is assumedthat TTP performs only arithmetic computation to produce the result. After computation, TTP sends result to respective parties and each party will removes all dummies to get the actual result as well as check the honesty of TTP by dummies. If any other party wants to reveal the actual data then the probability of breaking the data will be of the order l/mn, which is quite high and cannot be done in a polynomial time. The security is the most important factor in SMC that is why this protocol meets our requirements. Only limitation of protocol is encryption time. By choosing proper polynomials and their constants, we can reduce the encryption time. © 2007 IEEE.","Cryptography; Data mining; Information security; Privacy-preserving; Trusted third party","Computation theory; Data mining; Digital arithmetic; Feature extraction; Information management; Public key cryptography; Privacy preserving; Trusted third party; Network protocols"

This development is accompanied by an increasing relevance of security issues. For instance, the potential loss of privacy and other assets is a major concern for, both merchants and customers, in Internet-based commerce and, without being properly addressed, such very legitimate concerns hamper the growth of e-commerce. This article uses a comparison-shopping scenario to introduce a general methodology for formally verifying the security of multi-agent systems. Following the approach of possibilistic information flow security, the flow of information between and within agents is restricted in order to ensure that secrets will not be disclosed to unauthorized meddlers. The security requirements for the overall system are then decomposed into requirements for the individual agents that can be verified independently from each other. Exploiting the modular structure of a multi-agent system considerably reduces the complexity of the overall security analysis. The techniques for decomposing security requirements, for verifying individual agents, and for deriving global security guarantees for the entire system from locally verified properties are all generic in the sense that they apply also to many other systems and security requirements than the ones that appear in the example scenario. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is a powerful tool for the analysis of nonstationary signals, especially, chirp-like signal. Thus, it has become an active area in the signal processing community, with many applications of radar, communication, electronic warfare, and information security. Therefore, it is necessary for us to generalize the theorem for Fourier domain analysis of decimation and interpolation. Firstly, this paper defines the digital frequency in the fractional Fourier domain (FRFD) through the sampling theorems with FRFT. Secondly, FRFD analysis of decimation and interpolation is proposed in this paper with digital frequency in FRFD followed by the studies of interpolation filter and decimation filter in FRFD. Using these results, FRFD analysis of the sampling rate conversion by a rational factor is illustrated. The noble identities of decimation and interpolation in FRFD are then deduced using previous results and the fractional convolution theorem. The proposed theorems in this study are the bases for the generalizations of the multirate signal processing in FRFD, which can advance the filter banks theorems in FRFD. Finally, the theorems introduced in this paper are validated by simulations. © 2007 Science in China Press.","Decimation; Fractional Fourier transform; Interpolation; Sampling rate conversion; The digital frequency in the fractional Fourier domain",""

Results from studies of IM use in enterprise work settings make us believe that IM based services may prove useful also within the healthcare sector. However, today's public instant messaging services do not have the level of information security required for adoption of IM in healthcare. We proposed MedIMob, our own architecture for a secure enterprise IM service for use in healthcare. MedIMob supports IM clients on mobile devices in addition to desktop based clients. Methods: Security threats were identified in a risk analysis of the MedIMob architecture. The risk analysis process consists of context identification, threat identification, analysis of consequences and likelihood, risk evaluation, and proposals for risk treatment. Results: The risk analysis revealed a number of potential threats to the information security of a service like this. Many of the identified threats are general when dealing with mobile devices and sensitive data; others are threats which are more specific to our service and architecture. Individual threats identified in the risks analysis are discussed and possible counter measures presented. Discussion: The risk analysis showed that most of the proposed risk treatment measures must be implemented to obtain an acceptable risk level; among others blocking much of the additional functionality of the smartphone. To conclude on the usefulness of this IM service, it will be evaluated in a trial study of the human-computer interaction. Further work also includes an improved design of the proposed MedIMob architecture. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the economic implications of these defects for software vendors are not well understood. Lack of legal liability and the presence of switching costs and network externalities may protect software vendors from incurring significant costs in the event of a vulnerability announcement, unlike such industries as auto and pharmaceuticals, which have been known to suffer significant loss in market value in the event of a defect announcement. Although research in software economics has studied firms' incentives to improve overall quality, there have not been any studies which show that software vendors have an incentive to invest in building more secure software. The objectives of this paper are twofold. 1) We examine how a software vendor's market value changes when a vulnerability is announced. 2) We examine how firm and vulnerability characteristics mediate the change in the market value of a vendor. We collect data from leading national newspapers and industry sources, such as the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), by searching for reports on published software vulnerabilities. We show that vulnerability announcements lead to a negative and significant change in a software vendor's market value. In our sample, on average, a vendor loses around 0.6 percent value in stock price when a vulnerability is reported. We find that a software vendor loses more market share if the market is competitive or if the vendor is small. To provide further insight, we use the information content of the disclosure announcement to classify vulnerabilities into various types. We find that the change in stock price is more negative if the vendor fails to provide a patch at the time of disclosure. Also, more severe flaws have a significantly greater impact. Our analysis provides many interesting implications for software vendors as well as policy makers. In particular, our study provides some evidence of the value of secure software. © 2007 IEEE.","Event-study; Information security; Patching; Quality; Software vendors; Software vulnerability","Commerce; Costs; Quality of service; Security of data; Software design; Software engineering; Empirical analysis; Software vendors; Software vulnerability; Computer software selection and evaluation"

Such a language needs to be able to represent causal relations between, and definitions of, various concepts as well as uncertainty with respect to both concepts and relations. To support decision making properly, the language must also allow the representation of goals and decision alternatives.

The nation is a hierarchical system as it consists multiple classes of decisionmakers and stakeholders ranging from national policymakers to operators of specific critical infrastructure subsystems. Critical infrastructures (e.g., transportation, telecommunications, power, banking, etc.) are highly complex and interconnected. These interconnections take the form of flows of information, shared security, and physical flows of commodities, among others. In recent years, economic and infrastructure sectors have become increasingly dependent on networked information systems for efficient operations and timely delivery of products and services. In order to ensure the stability, sustainability, and operability of our critical economic and infrastructure sectors, it is imperative to understand their inherent physical and economic linkages, in addition to their cyber interdependencies. An interdependency model based on a transformation of the Leontief input-output (I-O) model can be used for modeling: (1) the steady-state economic effects triggered by a consumption shift in a given sector (or set of sectors); and (2) the resulting ripple effects to other sectors. The inoperability metric is calculated for each sector; this is achieved by converting the economic impact (typically in monetary units) into a percentage value relative to the size of the sector. Disruptive events such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and large-scale accidents have historically shown cascading effects on both consumption and production. Hence, a dynamic model extension is necessary to demonstrate the interplay between combined demand and supply effects. The result is a foundational framework for modeling cybersecurity scenarios for the oil and gas sector. A hypothetical case study examines a cyber attack that causes a 5-week shortfall in the crude oil supply in the Gulf Coast area. © 2007 Society for Risk Analysis.","Cybersecurity; Disaster analysis; Dynamic modeling; Input-output analysis; Interdependencies; Metrics; Risk management","Gulf Coast [United States]; North America; United States; Decision making; Economic analysis; Hierarchical systems; Risk management; Disaster analysis; Metrics; decision making; disaster management; economic impact; gas industry; hierarchical system; information system; infrastructure planning; input-output analysis; Internet; macroeconomics; modeling; natural disaster; oil industry; risk assessment; security threat; stakeholder; terrorism; cost benefit analysis; decision making; disaster; economic development; information system; review; risk benefit analysis; social dominance; social security; Risk analysis"

Achieving a secure web application involves several different issues like encrypting traffic and certain database information, strictly restricting the access control, etc. In this work we focus on detecting attempts of either gaining unauthorised access or misusing a web application. We introduce an intrusion detection software component based on text-mining techniques. By using text categorisation, it is capable of learning the characteristics of both normal and malicious user behaviour from the log entries generated by the web application server. Therefore, the detection of misuse in the web application is achieved without the need of any explicit programming or code writing, hence improving the system maintainability. Because telemedicine systems are usually critical in terms of the confidential information handled and the responsibilities consequently derived, we apply and evaluate our methods on a real web-based telemedicine system called Arnasa. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing approaches tend to address some aspects of information release, exposing the other aspects for possible attacks. It is striking that these approaches fall into two mostly separate categories: revelation-based (as in information purchase, aggregate computation, moves in a game, etc.) and encryption-based declassification (as in sending encrypted secrets over an untrusted network, storing passwords, etc.). This paper introduces gradual release, a policy that unifies declassification, encryption, and key release policies. We model an attacker's knowledge by the sets of possible secret inputs as functions of publicly observable outputs. The essence of gradual release is that this knowledge must remain constant between releases. Gradual release turns out to be a powerful foundation for release policies, which we demonstrate by formally connecting revelation-based and encryption-based declassification. Furthermore, we show that gradual release can be provably enforced by security types and effects. © 2007 IEEE.","","Data transfer; Information retrieval; Knowledge based systems; Security of data; Aggregate computation; Declassification; Public key cryptography"

The European Network of Excellence INTEROP classifies information security as a nonfunctional aspect of interoperability and as such it is an integral part of the design process for interoperable systems. In the last decade, academics and practitioners have shown their interest in information security, for example by developing security models for evaluating products and setting up security specifications in order to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, availability and accountability of data. Earlier research has shown that measures to achieve information security in the administrative or organisational level are missing or inadequate. Therefore, there is a need to improve information security models by including vital elements of information security. In this paper, we introduce a holistic view of information security based on a Swedish model combined with a literature survey. Furthermore we suggest extending this model using concepts based on semiotic theory and adopting the view of an information system as constituted of the technical, formal and informal (TFI) parts. The aim is to increase the understanding of the information security domain in order to develop a well-founded theoretical framework, which can be used both in the analysis and the design phase of interoperable systems. Finally, we describe and apply the Information Security (InfoSec) model to the results of three different case studies in the healthcare domain. Limits of the model will be highlighted and an extension will be proposed. © 2007 International Federation for Information Processing.","","Complex networks; Information systems; Interoperability; European networks; Healthcare domains; Information security models; Interoperable systems; Non-functional aspects; Organisational level; Systems and information; Theoretical framework; Security of data"

The model used is based on various levels of education and a randomly selected sample space. The model is also based on two assessments: the first focuses on information security in general, while the second assessment covers the following topics: Data classification Security job role Awareness programs Spam and virus knowledge Social engineering The sample space was randomly selected from a population of about 49,640 in Franklin County [5] and the results were then generalized for larger populations. The results show that there is a real need for information security awareness programs for the general public. However, the research also shows a large number of instructors needed per 1000 of population to start the information security awareness public program. These primary results have been looked at in two different aspects - the first as ""in-class delivery"" and the second as ""out-class delivery"".

One of the key reasons for this is users' declining trust in the internet. Over the past two decades, the internet has transformed many aspects of modern life. With an estimated four million users worldwide at the end of 2006, the use of the internet continues to grow. Building trust and confidence is one of the main enablers for the future growth and use of the internet. The paper aims to review some of the reasons behind the declining trust, the changing nature of cyber-threats, and aims to look at cybersecurity in the context of developing countries and the specific problems these countries are facing when dealing with growing number of cyber-threats. Design/methodology/approach - This contribution gives an overview of some of the evolving cyber-threats and their potential impact in order to determine whether the growth of the information society is really at risk. It further considers what the different stakeholders can do to build a safer and more secure information society. The paper poses questions, outlines possible options for a way forward and based on this gives the readers a better understanding of the issues and challenges involved in building confidence and security in the use of ICTs. The paper proposes a framework with increased co-operation, collaboration, and information sharing, to connect the individual cybersecurity communities and single initiatives, in order to allow stakeholders to build together a roadmap for cybersecurity. Findings - During the discussions leading up to and during the two phases of the World Summit on the information society, country representative participants re-affirmed their commitment to deal effectively with the significant and growing problems posed by spam and other cyber-threats. As no single country or entity can alone create trust, confidence and security in the use of ICTs, it is clear that increased international action is needed to address the issues involved. Practical implications - This paper tries to provide readers with a simple overview of the state of cybersecurity, and with a framework for further considering how new technologies and the growing use of the internet will impact upon stakeholders' trust in the use of ICTs. Originality/value - Along with increasing dependency on ICTs, new threats to network and information security have emerged. These include growing misuse of electronic networks for criminal purposes or for objectives that can furthermore adversely affect the integrity of critical infrastructures within states. This paper puts forward some concrete suggestions on how countries could look at the issues related to cybersecurity. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer crime; Data security; Developing countries; Information society; Internet","Computer crime; Cybernetics; Developing countries; Information science; Internet; User interfaces; Cybersecurity communities; Information society; Stakeholders; World Summit on the information society; Security of data"

'With this improved technology and infrastructure, ongoing and pro-active computer investigations are now a mandatory component of the IS enterprise' [16]. Corporate governance reports require that organizations should not only apply good corporate governance principles, but also practice good IT governance and specially IS governance. Organizations develop their security architectures based on current best practices for example [21] and [12]. These best practices do not consider the importance of putting controls or procedures in place that will ensure successful investigations. There is a definite need to adapt current Information Security (IS) best practices to include for example certain aspects of Digital Forensics (DF) readiness to the current best practices to address the shortcomings. Whilst IS and DF are considered as two different disciplines, there is a definite overlap between the two [29]. The aim of this paper is to examine the overlap between DF and IS, to determine the relevance of DF readiness to IS and propose the inclusion of certain aspects of DF readiness as a component for best practice for IS. © 2007 International Federation for Information Processing.","","Electronic crime countermeasures; Industrial management; Ubiquitous computing; Best practices; Corporate governance; Cyber-crimes; Digital forensic; IT governance; Mandatory components; Security Architecture; Security Best Practices; Security of data"

Enterprise architecture (EA) is proposed as a means for comprehensive and coordinated planning and management of corporate ICT and the security infrastructure. The EA approach is proposed as a pre-requisite for transparent and secure inter-organizational information exchange and business process support crossing corporate boundaries. This study provides an example of security architecture planning based on EA, which aligns the development of technological solutions with the business goals. The EA approach combines the planning of business and ICT developments. The alignment provides arguments for cohesive identity and access management (IAM) in a business network.

Many theorists now advocate that effective security policies should be created at senior management level. This is because executives are able to evaluate the organisation using a holistic approach as well as having the power to ensure that new systems and procedures are implemented in a timely manner. There is, however, a continuing lack of understanding regarding the strategic importance of managing information security. In addition, there is a gap in the literature on the relationship between directors and information security strategy. This paper attempts to close this gap by exploring how directors perceive their organisation's security and what factors influence their decisions on the development and implementation of information security strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on constructivist grounded theory. Forty-three interviews were conducted at executive level in 29 organisations. These interviews were then coded and analysed in order to develop new theory on directors' perception of risk and its effect on the development and implementation of information security strategy. Findings - The analysis shows that senior managers' engagement with information security is dependent on two key variables: the strategic importance of information systems to their organisation and their perception of risk. Additionally, this research found that these two variables are affected by both organisational contextual factors and the strategic and operational actions undertaken within the business. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the two board variables also have an impact on the organisation's environment as well as its strategic and operational actions. This paper uses the data gathered from the interviews to develop a model of these factors. In addition, a perception grid is constructed which illustrates the potential concerns that can drive board engagement. Practical implications - The paper illustrates the advantages of using the perception grid to understand and develop current and future information security issues. Originality/value - The paper investigates how organisational directors perceive information security and how this perception influences the development of their information security strategy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Boards; Data security; Governance; Information control; Perception","Data acquisition; Information management; Information technology; Risk analysis; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Information control; Perception grids; Security policies; Senior management levels; Security of data"

Our claim is that teaching offensive methods yields better security professionals than teaching defensive techniques alone.

DMPTC differentiates static system software and dynamic application software and takes different ways and policies to control the loading and running of various executable codes. The goal of DMPTC is to build a trusted computing platform by making computing platform only load and run trustworthy executables. DMPTC can be used to: 1) resist malicious codes (including known and unknown virus) which are the most serious threats to information systems, so as to improve system continuity of operation; and 2) help to manage and control what applications can be executed in business systems, improve their cost-effectiveness and productivity efficiency. DMPTC mainly uses the hash value of executables to verify their authenticity and integrity which is always a time-exhausted process; However, DMPTC gives great consideration to the impact it causes to system performance. Based on the attributes of various executables and by taking advantage of Windows interior security mechanisms, DMPTC reduces the time cost of the executables verification process greatly. The testing of DMPTC implemented on Windows platform shows that the performance loss caused by DMPTC is lower than 1%, and it is this optimization result that ultimately assures the flexibility and utility of DMPTC.","Information security; Malicious code resistance; Security performance; Transitive trust; Trusted computing","Cost effectiveness; Electric resistance; Productivity; Security of data; Verification; Information security; Malicious code resistance; Security performance; Transitive trust; Trusted computing; Information systems"

Social pressures that can affect low- and high-priority incident-reporting rates are also examined. Design/methodology/approach - The authors reviewed the incident-reporting system literature. As there are few studies of information security reporting systems, they also considered safety-reporting systems. These have been in use for many years and much is known about them. Safety is used to ""fill in the gaps"". The authors then constructed a system dynamics computer simulation model. The model is used to test how an incident-reporting system reacts under different conditions. Findings - Incident reporters face incentives anddisincentives based on effects on through-put but have limited knowledge of what is important to the organization's security. Even if a successful incident-reporting policy is developed, the organization may become the victim of its own success, as a growing volume of reports put higher pressure on incident-handling resources. Continuously hiring personnel is unsustainable. Continuously improving automated tools for incident response promises more leverage. Research limitations/implications - The challenges in safety may not be the same as those in information security.

The research also investigates the success of two memory augmentation strategies in increasing memorability of graphical passwords. The results demonstrate that multiple graphical passwords are substantially more effective than multiple PIN numbers.

Issues arise however when agreement protocols are realized in Information Assurance (IA) settings where extreme failure behaviors such as send-omission of processes and message timeliness violations are likely. The issues are compounded by security weaknesses in the communication software that make it easier for intruders to stage attacks. These issues impact the design of agreement protocols, which have hitherto assumed only benign failures such as process crash and network message loss/delay. In this paper, we revisit the distributed agreement problem, taking into account the IA dimension as well. Our study reveals the need for a secure centralized entity to realize the group decision-making and state coordination functions. Two functions are studied: dynamic group membership management to exclude non-cooperating members from the group and security-reinforced communications to enforce mutual anonymity of members. Our paper walks through a state-machine based realization of distributed agreements using secure atomic multicast protocol as an underlying communication substrate. The use of our approach in IA applications is also described. © 2007 IEEE.","Authenticated message flows; Distributed coordination; Faulty process behaviors; Group membership management; Mutual process anonymity","Distributed computer systems; Information analysis; Problem solving; Security of data; Atomic multicast message delivery; Communication software; Group membership management; Information Assurance (IA); Network protocols"

The GIG is expected to facilitate DoD's transformation by allowing warfighters, policy makers and support personnel to engage in rapid decision making. The roadmap is designed to take advantage of converged services of voice, data, video, and imagery over common data links. The vision is to have commanders identify threats more effectively, make informed decisions, and respond with greater precision and lethality. The information advantage gained through the GIG and network-centric warfare (NCW) allows a warfighting force to achieve dramatically improved information positions, in the form of common operational pictures that provide the basis for shared situational awareness and knowledge, and a resulting increase in combat power. The GIG Precedence and Preemption (P&P) requirements stem from the need to utilize scarce resources at critical times in the most effective way in support of national security, the intelligence community and the war-fighter. Information Assurance (IA) enables all information and data to be available end-to-end to support any mission without delay in accordance to the sensitivity of the task. Together, P&P and IA ensure data availability integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. This study addresses and analyzes the QoS and P&P requirements and architecture for the GIG. Threat scenarios are presented and used to evaluate the reference architectures. The goal of the study is to assess the Information Assurance concerns associated with implementing Precedence and Preemption within the GIG and to guarantee an acceptable minimum level of security and protection for DoD networks.","Assured services; DoD communications; End-to-end transport; GIG; Information assurance; Interoperability; Net-centric; Networking; Precedence and preemption; QoS","Channel capacity; Information analysis; Interoperability; Quality of service; Assured services; DoD communications; End-to-end transport; Net centric; Precedence and preemption; Internet"

Botnets, remotely controlled and operated by botmasters or botherders, can launch massive denial of service attacks, multiple penetration attacks, or any other malicious network activity on a massive scale. While bot army activity has, in the past, been limited to fraud, blackmail, and other forms of criminal activity, their potential for causing large-scale damage to the entire internet; for launching large-scale, coordinated attacks on government computers and networks; and for large-scale, coordinated data gathering from thousands of users and computers on any network has been underestimated.

Not only will the patient's satisfaction with the medical treatment depend on the cooperation and communication between the nurse and the doctor, but also on the nurse and her way of dealing with and usage of IT technology.

How many of the nurses will have probably ever thought about the importance and sensitivity of the data they daily use? Without doubt, computer-literacy among members of all professional groups within society has increased enormously in the last years. Nevertheless, especially the area of health care service demands some more specific knowledge and awareness by the concerned staff related to topics of possibilities, benefits, possible mistakes and theirs consequences, especially from the security point of view, including the sensitivity of the working area, as well as ethical issues.

Initial implementation of this integrative framework occurred at Marymount University in an introductory graduate-level computer security course, which is the first in a series of courses based on this model.

First, not all students at this level have adequate mathematical backgrounds to be able to profit fully from the program even though they may meet all formal prerequisites. Second, there may exist areas where the depth and rigor of the mathematical foundations currently in place in the curriculum is not be strictly necessary.

We show that it is possible to visualize the complex graphs, including all possible network attack paths while still keeping complexity manageable.

The authors combine field study estimates with a Leontief-based input-output model to estimate the macro-economic costs of a targeted internet outage that disrupts the supply chain. The authors find that supply chain vulnerability or resiliency to cyber disruptions is not necessarily dependent on the types of technology employed, but rather how the technology is used to enable supply chain processes and the type of attack experienced. The authors find that some supply chains like oil and gas could be significantly impacted by certain cyber disruptions. However, similar to other causes of supply chain disruptions such as labor disputes or natural disasters, the authors find that firms can be very resilient to cyber disruptions. The validity of the approach is limited by the accuracy of parameters gathered through field studies and the resolution of government economic data. Managers should examine how information technology is used to enable their supply chain processes and develop capabilities that provide resilience to failures. Lean supply chains that focus on minimizing inventory may be more vulnerable to major information system failures unless they take special steps to build resilience.

The second aim is to describe some pilot study research that the authors have conducted in an attempt to ascertain whether the embedding of symbols and graphics within information security messages achieves a shift in the risk perceptions of computer end-users. Design/methodology/approach - Two pilot studies were undertaken. The objective of each study was to establish whether the embedding of a relevant graphic relating to some known aspect of information security, when placed inside an information security message, would have any influence on the information security risk perceptions of any individual to whom the message was being communicated. In both studies, the method of eliciting a response from each participant involved the use of a type of semantic differential (SD) grid. Findings - On completing an analysis of the responses to the SD grid survey for both studies, no statistically significant differences were detected between the groups with respect to any of the six relevant scales. Nevertheless, it seems that the differences were large enough for the present authors to be convinced that the SD measures used are an appropriate survey technique for future studies in a workplace environment. Research limitations/implications - The research subjects (i.e. survey participants) for both pilot studies were students of the University of South Australia. There are many ways in which information risk communication could be made more effective and this paper only attempts to show how graphics and symbols could be used to convey risk messages more effectively. This paper does not in any way attempt to provide any ""silver-bullet"" solutions for management in terms of what they can do towards managing information risk. Practical implications - The ultimate objective of this research is to subsequently advise management on how they can communicate information risk simply and more effectively to achieve the final outcome, i.e. the mitigation of actual risks. Originality/value - It is believed that, ifthe effectiveness of the various forms of risk communication within an organisation can be increased, then the general perception of the risks to the information systems will be more realistic.","Australia; Data security; Information; Risk analysis","Codes (symbols); Information management; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risk perception; Semantics; Computer end-users; Information risks; Risk communication; Semantic differential (SD); Security of data"

A definition of an ideal functionality for deniable authentication is formulated. A new deniable authentication protocol is proposed based on two primitives of the verifiably smooth projective Hashing (VSPH) and non-committing encryptions (NCE). This new approach is practically relevant to VSPH based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption and NCE based on the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption. Compared with a timing constraint and public directory model, simulation of the concurrent protocols is not needed to restrict an adversary capability in a common reference string (CRS) model. The protocols are forward deniable and UC security against adaptive adversaries. Unlike previous proposals with the CCA2 public-key cryptosystem or multi-trapdoor commitments paradigm, the new paradigm leads to more efficient protocols.","Concurrent deniable authentication; Information security; Universally composable security; Verifiably smooth projective Hashing; Witness-indistinguishable","Authentication; Cryptography; Network protocols; Concurrent deniable authentication; Information security; Universally composable security; Verifiably smooth projective Hashing; Witness-indistinguishable; Security of data"

These may include the application of cryptography, the hierarchical modeling of organizations in order to assure confidentiality, or the distribution of accountability and responsibility by law, among interested parties. The history of Information Security reaches back to ancient times and starts with the emergence of bureaucracy in administration and warfare. Some aspects, such as the interception of encrypted messages during World War II, have attracted huge attention, whereas other aspects have remained largely uncovered. There has never been any effort to write a comprehensive history. This is most unfortunate, because Information Security should be perceived as a set of communicating vessels, where technical innovations can make existing legal or organisational frame-works obsolete and a breakdown of political authority may cause an exclusive reliance on technical means. This book is intended as a first field-survey. It consists of twenty-eight contributions, written by experts in such diverse fields as computer science, law, or history and political science, dealing with episodes, organisations and technical developments that may considered to be exemplary or have played a key role in the development of this field. These include: the emergence of cryptology as a discipline during the Renaissance, the Black Chambers in 18th century Europe, the breaking of German military codes during World War II, the histories of the NSA and its Soviet counterparts and contemporary cryptology.

In this regard, quantum communication and cryptography offer new opportunities to tackle ICT security. Quantum Information Processing and Communication (QIPC) is a scientific field where new conceptual foundations and techniques are being developed. They promise to play an important role in the future of information Security. It is therefore essential to have a cross-fertilizing development between quantum technology and cryptology in order to address the security challenges of the emerging quantum era. In this article, we discuss the impact of quantum technology on the current as well as future crypto-techniques. We then analyse the assumptions on which quantum computers may operate. Then we present our vision for the distribution of security attributes using a novel form of trust based on Heisenberg's uncertainty; and, building highly secure quantum networks based on the clear transmission of single photons and/or bundles of photons able to withstand unauthorized reading as a result of secure protocols based on the observations of quantum mechanics. We argue how quantum cryptographic systems need to be developed that can take advantage of the laws of physics to provide long-term security based on solid assumptions. This requires a structured integration effort to deploy quantum technologies within the existing security infrastructure. Finally, we conclude that classical cryptographic techniques need to be redesigned and upgraded in view of the growing threat of cryptanalytic attacks posed by quantum information processing devices leading to the development of post-quantum cryptography.","Information security; QKD; Quantum cryptography; Quantum protocols; SECOQC project whitepaper","Computer simulation; Cryptography; Information analysis; Photons; Quantum theory; Security of data; Crypto-techniques; Heisenberg's uncertainty; Quantum era; Quantum Information Processing and Communication (QIPC); Quantum information processing devices; Quantum technology; Quantum computers"

To ensure that employees comply with organizations' information security procedures, a number of information security policy compliance measures have been proposed in the past. Prior research has criticized these measures as lacking theoretically and empirically grounded principles to ensure that employees comply with information security policies. To fill this gap in research, this paper advances a new model that explains employees' adherence to information security policies. In this model, we extend the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) by integrating the General Deterrence Theory (GDT) and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) with PMT. To test this model, we collected data (N = 917) from four different companies. The results show that threat appraisal, self-efficacy and response efficacy have a significant impact on intention to comply with information security policies. Sanctions have a significant impact on actual compliance with information security policies.

Design/methodology/approach - The intended users were studied in order to understand their needs. An iterative design process was used where the designs were first made on paper, then as a prototype interface and later as a final interface design. All was tested by subjects within the target user group. Findings - The interface was perceived as being successful by the test subjects and the sponsoring organization, Siguru. The major conclusion of the study is that managers use knowledge of information security mainly for financial and strategic matters which focus more on risk issues than security issues. To facilitate the need of managers the study presents three heuristics for the design of management information security system interfaces. Research limitations/implications - This interface was tested on a limited set of users and further tests could be done, especially of users with other cultural/professional backgrounds. Practical implications - This paper presents a useful set of heuristics that can be used in development of management information systems as well as other practical tips for similar projects. Originality/value - This paper gives an example of a successful user-centred security development process.

So far, these two technologies have been studied separately. This is because any data can be compressed if necessary, and then encrypted. The problem is that, with the rapid progress in computing technology, the encrypted data will not be secure any more after a few years. Once the data are decrypted, all secret will be leaked. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a new way to increase the information security through integration of data compression and cryptography. Specifically, the data to be considered here are images, and the compression technique is the k-PCA, which was proposed by us recently for image compression. The main advantage of using k-PCA is that this technique is data-dependent. Unlike other existing universal compression techniques, such as DCT, DWT, and so on, the non-linear transformation function used in k-PCA are found using the data to be compressed. Thus, even if the encrypted data are deciphered by some malicious persons, it is hard for them to reconstruct the images without the transformation function, which is encrypted and kept by the user as a secret key. To encrypt the compressed data and the transformation function, we can use any existing techniques, as long as they are relatively secure. © 2007 IEEE.","","Data communication systems; Principal component analysis; Problem solving; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Memory spaces; Transformation functions; Data compression"

However, unbalanced data sets often appear in many applications. As a simple, effective categorization method, kNN is widely used, but it suffers from biased data sets, too. In developing the Prototype of Internet Information Security for Shanghai Council of Information and Security, we detect that when training data set is biased, almost all test documents of some rare categories are classified into common ones. To alleviate such a misfortune, we propose a novel concept, critical point (CP), and adapt traditional kNN by integrating CP's approximate value, LB or UB, training number with decision rules. Exhaustive experiments illustrate that the adapted kNN achieves significant classification performance improvement on biased corpora. © 2007 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Approximation theory; Critical path analysis; Data acquisition; Security of data; Software prototyping; Data sets; KNN text classifier; Standard classification; Test documents; Classification (of information)"

The position in South Africa is no exception and malware presents a very real danger to corporate South Africa's information assets, resources and systems, as it has the capacity to undermine firewalls, hijack Virtual Private Networks (VPN's) and defeat digital signatures. The threats associated with malware have several salient legal issues embedded in it and these are elaborated in the paper. Unfortunately, corporate South Africa is still largely ignorant of the range of tools available to the ""Darkside"" and the potential legal consequences which may ensue if this cyber risk materialises. The article helps in the understanding of the problem. Design/methodology/approach - This paper examines malware, and more specifically legal liability for malware from a South African perspective. The account contained in this contribution deals with the question whether or not a company who falls victim to a malware attack or unwillingly facilitates such an attack, may be held legally liable. This is done by giving a brief overview of the nature of the cyber risk malware, before moving on to observe the consequences which may ensue if a malware attack occurs. Corporations who fall victim to malware attacks or unwittingly facilitates such an attack may suffer: direct damage; indirect damage; and physiological damage. Findings - It will be pointed out that malware attacks may result in legal liability in civil law for the ""victim"" company because of its failure to take reasonable steps to secure the information assets, resources and systems of the company. Research limitations/implications - It will furthermore be observed that companies who unwillingly facilitate malware attacks, where for instance the company's own employee uses company resources to launch a virus attack, may be faced with legal liability in the form of vicarious liability. Practical implications - Suggestions are made on how to avoid legal liability for failed information security. Originality/value - No such a study has yet been undertaken in South Africa as most view the law and technology as strange and perhaps dangerous bedfellows. The study will also be of use, value and interest to the library and information community outside South Africa since it raises an issue of real significance.","Data security; Due diligence; Information control; Legal process","Computer system firewalls; Cybernetics; Electronic document identification systems; Information management; Risk management; Security of data; Cyber risk; Information control; Malware attack; Internet"

The chapter explains how pervasive issues of identity really are. Philosophy, science, and religion may be viewed as attempts for coming to terms with identity. The chapter presents an encompassing framework. An enneadic model of semiosis is sketched, which is then applied to design a pragmatic or behavioral orientation at identity management. Communication and identity management are largely synonymous; identity management is essentially dialogical. The chapter presents illustrations from natural history that serve to emphasize the generally valid behavioral orientation. The chapter illustrates how the semiotic framework helps to gain overview. Selected developments in identity management at the cultural level, that is, as practiced by human communities and societies are discussed in the chapter. The chapter proposes the partly electronic future of identity management as a program for open security in an open society. Security, then, only becomes more specific in an informational sense with virtual access. It is with virtual access that identity management actually meets information security because virtual access is, by definition, connected to information resources. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of the intensive in-residence summer program is to help build Information Assurance education and research capacity at minority-serving universities. Since 2002, in the first 5 editions, over 45 faculty have participated in the month-long intensive program, which has resulted in the development of a number of new offerings at partner schools, including updates to existing courses, new courses, certificate programs and degree programs. Carnegie Mellon has also supported regional information assurance symposiums and mini-boot camps, additional information assurance grants, and a number of research projects and publications involving faculty and students at partner schools, as well as multi-institution collaborative centers. Throughout the planning and implementation the Carnegie Mellon IACBP goal has been on choosing faculty and university programs that are committed to information assurance curriculum development, teaching and research.

One example of this success is California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona), which became a designated Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Information Assurance in 2005. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the success of the IACBP and the experience of Cal Poly Pomona and subsequent designation as a CAE. A symposium recently brought back graduates of the IACBP to share outcomes. A recent survey was also conducted of IACBP attendees to document IA education, training and outreach activities. The results provide strong evidence of Carnegie Mellon IACBP successes. © 2007 EDSIG.","Capacity building; Curriculum design; Curriculum development; Faculty; Information Assurance; Information systems curriculum; Information systems security","Curricula; Information systems; Research; Societies and institutions; Capacity building; Curriculum designs; Curriculum development; Faculty; Information assurance; Information systems security; Teaching"

When this involves participants from diverse professional communities, several barriers to effective communication can arise. As in all human communities, shorthand representations, such as specialized jargon, that aid in efficient and precise communications have developed. These shorthands rely on the common background of the participants, including common knowledge, perceptions, and assumptions about the field and its concepts, capabilities, and limitations. These shorthands can become a source of miscommunication when participants are from different communities. The development of concurrent coding theory has brought members of the network, information assurance, and communications communities together in ways unfamiliar to most. This is due to the manner in which the theory is applied to omnidirectional communications to mitigate hostile jamming without the use of shared secrets. Being novel and unconventional, several conflicting assumptions have been exposed. Here we discuss our experiences in recognizing, analyzing, and overcoming many of these misconceptions, including our own, despite how surprisingly resilient some of them have proven to be. However, by adopting a systems-thinking approach and drawing upon most peoples' innate ability to think analogically, we have significantly improved our ability to convey our key concepts.","Interdisciplinary communication; Jam-resistant communications; Systems thinking","Communication; Computer programming; Cybernetics; System theory; Common knowledge; Common languages; Effective communication; Human communities; Information assurance; Interdisciplinary communications; Professional community; Systems thinking; Information technology"

Communication and identity management are largely synonymous; identity management is essentially dialogical. The chapter presents illustrations from natural history that serve to emphasize the generally valid behavioral orientation. The chapter illustrates how the semiotic framework helps to gain overview. Selected developments in identity management at the cultural level, that is, as practiced by human communities and societies are discussed in the chapter. The chapter proposes the partly electronic future of identity management as a program for open security in an open society.

Often their findings and their methodologies are subject to criticism from the information security community, professional bodies and others in the profession. This paper looks at the viewpoints of both the producers and the critics of the surveys. The criticisms cover such issues as the methodologies, the response rates, the experience of the respondents, the design of the questions and the interpretation of the results. This paper looks at these issues and discusses the validity of these criticisms, the impact of the surveys and their value to business and government. It compares the methodologies of some of the largest local and international players in the area. It discusses the issues arising from flawed methodologies, inaccurate information and poor processes, including the perceived lack of integrity and the accuracy of the measurements and methodologies. Despite the strong criticism a middle ground emerged. Data input by the participants, whether accurate or not, may be highly subjective and influenced by their environment and business profile. Furthermore, security at a business level may be extremely complex, the governance principles dictating that the organisation profile, management ideologies and core business values must be accounted for and balanced even for IT. The paper also considers the interpretation of the results and how they may be influenced by current and future products and the vendors of those products. Finally the paper takes a closer look at the use of the surveys in a business context and attempts to show that if constructively used, these surveys can be powerful metric tools used in driving information security strategies in spite of their perceived deficiencies. © Alexis Guillot & Sue Kennedy 2007.","Business context; Critics; Information security surveys; Interpretation of results; Methodology","Industrial management; Security of data; Business community; Business profile; Core business; Critics; Data input; Inaccurate information; Interpretation of results; Methodology; Metric tools; Response rate; Surveys"

As we learnt from practical experiences, it is especially difficult to manually define and manage security policies, for example for access control, with a sufficient level of assurance. The human security administrator is not able to cope with the high complexity of the interactions of the application and the low level, platform specific security policy. Therefore, a new approach is needed to improve the correctness of the security policies, and to make security policies manageable. This is particularly eminent in two areas: serviceoriented architecture (SOA) style environments where agility support and reuse (also of policies!) are critical; and in environments where collaborative decision making (CDM) has to be implemented, which typically requires agile secure information sharing (especially sensitive cross-organisation between coalition partners). This paper shows how security engineering can be integrated into a model-driven software development process. In our approach, UML models of the application's functional properties are flexibly augmented with security relevant information. Together with a high level security policy defined by the security administrator, this augmented functional model is then used in an automatic model transformation to generate the platform specific security policy with high assurance. With this approach, which also supports the separation of concerns in model based software engineering, we can automatically generate security-critical applications for different middleware platforms like our SecureMiddleware, which is an extended implementation of the CORBA Components Model with improved support for properties like security. The concepts, platforms and tools presented in the paper are currently used for the development of several large-scale and secure applications, for example for building a Virtual Air-Space Management System with strong security requirements, and within the U.S. Naval Research Lab SINS project.","Collaborative decision making; Cross-organisation security policy; Information assurance; Model driven architecture; Model driven security; Policy management; Secure information sharing; Security policy","Access control; Common object request broker architecture (CORBA); Decision making; Distributed computer systems; Middleware; Security systems; Software engineering; Space platforms; Unified Modeling Language; Collaborative decision making; Information assurance; Information sharing; Model driven architectures; Model driven security; Policy management; Security policy; Information management"

In this paper, we adopt the system dynamics approach to security analysis, with the help of an information security life cycle model. By identifying the causal loop among such variables as the attractiveness of information target and the total number of attacks, we develop a system dynamics model for analyzing the effect of organizational security investments in the attack stage of the information security life cycle. Using this model, we simulate a number of security management scenarios and demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the system dynamics approach. The model presented in this paper is adaptive, and its parameters and relationships can be calibrated with empirical data for further refinement and customization for specific situations in real world organizations.","Information security; Security investment; Security management; Security modelling; Simulation; System dynamics","Industrial management; Information systems; Internet; Investments; Life cycle; Security of data; System theory; Analytical tool; Complex nature; Decision makers; Empirical data; Information security investment; Information security managements; Internet technology; Life cycle model; Security analysis; Security investments; Security management; Simulation; System Dynamics; System dynamics approach; System dynamics model; Value of information; Information management"

In recent years, in the concepts of dynamic capability and operational capability in the Management of Technology (MOT) or Management Strategy, there has been one tacit understanding. In these discussions, it is to be assumed that the firms' infrastructure already exists. In other words, the firms, as the subject of this research, have been limited to the activity of the technical system infrastructure (e.g., manufacturing, energy, and distribution) which has already been constructed. However, a new doubt arises. How can the firms' capability within such an infrastructure be explained? That is, how is the infrastructure caused? And how does organizational change occur? We think that, from this aspect, our research is useful in organizational studies. As the recent organizational research illustrates, especially Actor-Network Theory (Callon and Law, 1997; Latour, 1999) and Practice Based Approach (Nicolini, et al., 2003), any organization is embedded in a socially constructed network, and the network cannot be separated from the organization (Latour, 1987; Ueno, 1999). It is important to research how the technical system is used by understanding organizational operations and organizational change. Therefore, in this thesis, a HRO concept is presented as one means to understand an organization's technical system. Such an organization is highly safe and reliable, though this organization's environment is dangerous, meaning that a defect or mistake, and the ensuing trouble, is significant (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2001). That is, the situation is perceived to be sensitive, and the organization that installs the safety mechanism beforehand does so under circumstances in which the problem is very easily caused. The starting point of the HRO research is, ""Why does the accident's seriousness and frequency, and the type of accident occur differently among organizations?"" The research also considers the point, ""Awareness of the issues that allow the discovery of various influential factor groups, based on prior experience research"" (Nishimoto, 2004). This is different from the existing research of on organization that considers a technical system that has already been constructed. Furthermore, since the technical system and the organization are closely related, an organization should be concerned because of this relationship, and decide whether a problem occurs within an operation. The thesis develops from this as follows. First of all, it explains from what aspect the error study of an existing organization has advanced research. Next, it takes a general view of HRO and studies it from a point differing from existing research. Finally, the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry, especially Internet Service Provider (xSP), is presented as a HRO case. Because ICT is a complex Socio-Technical system, there is a high possibility of connecting with the crisis with big and small mistakes, and the ensuring trouble. Therefore, the concept of HRO is easily suited. Moreover, these firms operate with the most advanced technology, as well as with various networks (e.g., government, firms, and consumers). In addition, the attitude of ICT operations is becoming more and more tough, bordering on the belief that, ""Mistakes are not permitted."" This is due to the enforcement of the Act for Protection of Computer Processed Personal Data Held by Administrative Organs, the introduction of Information Security Management System (ISMS), and the setting of Service Level Agreement (SLA). Therefore, showing the effectiveness of HRO in actual firms becomes possible by analyzing the ICT industry.","Complex Socio-Technical systems; High Reliability Organization (HRO); Information and Communication Technology (ICT); Social Constructed network; Three Error Researches","Accidents; Communication; Industrial management; Industrial research; Industry; Information management; Internet service providers; Reliability; Security of data; Social sciences computing; Actor network theory; Advanced researches; Advanced technology; Constructed networks; Dynamic capabilities; High reliability; High reliability organizations; ICT industries; Influential factors; Information and Communication Technologies; Information security management systems; Management of technology; Management strategies; Operational capabilities; Organization studies; Organizational change; Organizational research; Organizational studies; Prior experience; Safety mechanisms; Service Level Agreements; Sociotechnical systems; Technical systems; Information technology"

Despite the prevalence of technical security measures, individual employees remain the last line - and frequently the weakest link - in corporate defenses. When individuals choose to disregard security policies and procedures, the organization is at risk. How, then, can organizations motivate their employees to follow security guidelines? Using an organizational control lens, we build a model to explain individual information security precaution-taking behavior. Specific hypotheses are developed and tested using a field survey. We examine elements of control and introduce the concept of ""mandatoriness"" which we define as the degree to which individuals perceive that compliance with existing security policies and procedures is compulsory or expected by organizational management. We find that the acts of specifying policies and evaluating behaviors are effective in convincing individuals that security policies are mandatory. The perception of mandatoriness is effective in motivating individuals to take security precautions.","Control; Information security; Mandatoriness","Control; Information systems; Motivation; Security of data; Field surveys; Mandatoriness; Organizational management; Security policy; Technical security; Security systems"

So this paper adopts an information supply chain perspective on information security that involves a firm's business network. Understanding the nature of risk in the information supply chain is fundamental to managing it effectively. This in turn requires an understanding of the structure of an information supply chain and the behavior of risk within it. A framework for risk propagation in an information supply chain is proposed in the paper to address the behavior of risk. A business-oriented structure of an information supply chain is also presented. The two are combined in an illustration of the propagation of threats through an information supply chain. A system dynamics approach is used to investigate this situation using an epidemic model. Simulation results are briefly discussed and future directions for research are indicated.","Information security; Risk management; Supply chain","Industry; Information systems; Risk management; Supply chains; Business networks; Business problems; Epidemic models; Information supply chain; System dynamics approach; Security of data"

In conceptual model, we draw upon switching costs where transaction costs, learning costs, and artificial costs were examined as main costs for software switching decision. Our findings shown only two out of three types of switching costs have influence over corporate antivirus software switching decisions. Despite the existence of switching costs, businesses continue to repeat software switching because the perceived risks of security threats are much greater than the switching cost itself. Furthermore, we examine various approaches to the cost of switching and then propose an index map to evaluate switching decision.

In fact, it has strong practical implications for the management of IS and, at the same time, it gives very interesting insights into understanding the process of social phenomena when communication information technologies are deployed in organizations. Current standards and best practices for the design and management of information systems security, recommend structured and mechanistic approaches, such as risk management methods and techniques, in order to address security issues. However, risk analysis and risk evaluation processes have their limitations, when security incidents occur, they emerge in a context, and their rarity and even their uniqueness give rise to unpredictable threats. The analysis of these phenomena which are characterized by breakdowns, surprises and sideeffects, requires a theoretical approach which is able to examine and interpret subjectively the detail of each incident.

To achieve such a superior information position enterprises and nations, alike, must not only collect and record correct, accurate, timely and useful information but also ensure that information recorded is not lost to competitors due to lack of comprehensive security and leaks. Further, enterprises that aim to attain information superiority must also ensure mechanisms of validating and verifying information to reduce the chances of mis-information. Although, research has been carried out into ways to increase the security of information and detect leaks, not enough focus has been given to the key elements of information, namely data and context. This paper outlines the importance of data in contributing to information superiority and highlights the lack of data centric approach in attaining information superiority.

It is thus important to investigate the factors that will influence a user to practice computer security in the context of an organization. With such motivation in mind, this study uses the Health Belief Model, a well-established model from preventive healthcare, to study users' computer security behavior. An instrument was developed based on health and security literature and conceptually validated.

Countries face the challenge of applying new approaches to the Internet in the prevention, detection and investigation of crime and terrorism and the prosecution of the perpetrator. Commission of crimes and terrorism as well as securing the Internet against terrorism and other crimes result in a conflict between security, a technical issue and privacy, a legal aspect. A perplexing question is whether an Internet user can expect online privacy and whether globalisation in respect of the use of the Internet and the approaches in combating crime and especially terrorism have not resulted in an online environment that is incompatible with privacy rights.","","Security of data; Terrorism; World Wide Web; Information security professionals; Internet security; Legal conflicts; New approaches; Online environments; Online privacy; Right to privacies; Security and privacy; Computer crime"

In order to avoid information laundering, it is important to combine defense along the different dimensions.

According to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 6212.01D (CJCSI 6212.01D), Information Technology (IT) and National Security Systems (NSS) are not considered net-centric unless they satisfy the following Net-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPP): 1) comply with the Net-Centric Operations and Warfare (NCOW) Reference Model (RM), 2) support integrated Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) products, 3) comply with Global Information Grid (GIG) Key Interface Profiles (KIP) in the DOD Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR), and 4) comply with DOD 8500 series Information Assurance (IA) requirements. [1] A primary security document in the DOD 8500 series is DOD Instruction 8500.2, which mandates Information Assurance (IA) requirements in the form of specific IA controls. This paper will demonstrate that DIS, HLA and TENA are not net-centric by highlighting non-compliance with selected DODI 8500.2 IA controls. Whenever unclassified or classified DOD-owned computing resources are used, all DOD simulation community computing efforts involving networked DOD resources must comply with the DODI 8500.2 IA controls or risk noncompliance with the DOD Information Assurance Certification & Accreditation Process (DIACAP) interim guidance. 1 All United States federal agencies, including the DOD, are bound by the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Public Law 107-347, to annually perform reviews and report the effectiveness of their information security programs. Compliance with FISMA is compulsory for all federal agencies. Agency reports are sent to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) which then integrates them to be forwarded to Congress. [2] The DOD uses the DIACAP to certify, accredit and authorize the operation of DOD information systems consistent with the reporting requirements under FISMA. The Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) of 1996, also known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA), Public Law 104-106, was enacted to reform Information Technology (IT) management across the Federal Government. One of the primary requirements under the CCA was the creation of Chief Information Officer (CIO) positions with expanded powers and responsibilities within all US government agencies. Additionally, the CCA defines IT 2 and National Security Systems (NSS) 3, key to determining categories of system information assurance requirements. Department of Defense Directive 4630.05 (DODD 4630.05) ""Interoperability and Supportability of Information Technology and National Security Systems"" mandates the requirement for IT and NSS to comply with the NR-KPPs. [4] Either 1) DOD CIOs will be required to produce exception waivers involving most distributed M&S resources that will be reported to Congress, 2) some significant IA policy changes will have to be enacted and implemented, or 3) a new open standards-based architectural security substrate must be developed for DIS, TENA and HLA. This paper delves into this third scenario. Such a standard would have to achieve the following: 1) satisfy the four NR-KPPs, 2) use the Information Systems Security Engineering (ISSE) process defined by the Information Assurance Technical Framework (IATF), and 3) have at least one physical implementation that is ultimately DIACAP certified. Ideally, there should be two or more genetically independent implementations that are interoperable at the wire level.","DIS; FISMA; HLA; IA; SOA; TENA","Accreditation; Architecture; Industrial management; Information systems; Personnel; Security of data; Security systems; DIS; FISMA; HLA; IA; SOA; TENA; Interoperability"

It is clear that protection of sensitive patient information is imperative yet the overarching conceptual business processes required to ensure this protection are not well suited to this context. The issue of sensitivity of information, together with the expectation that security can be effectively implemented by non-security trained professionals creates an insecure environment. The general security processes used by business, including those for risk assessment, are difficult to operationally put into practice in the medical environment and this one-sizefits- all approach is shown to be ineffective.

Threats are classified as either human or natural. Threat assessments are evaluations of human actions or natural events that can adversely affect business operations and specific assets. Threat assessments are used to evaluate the likelihood of adverse events, such as terrorism and crime, against a given asset as well as other hazards such as natural disasters that may affect business operations. As such, the focal points of threat assessments are assets (targets) and the threats that seek to compromise those targets. The process of threat assessment includes-threat identification, asset classification, and consequence/critical analysis. General threat assessments estimate the likelihood of adversarial attacks, including the type of adversary, their tactics, and their capabilities. Facility specific threat assessments also define the number of adversaries and their method of operation or attack.

One of the aims of the project is to develop an architectural framework and a process model, with supporting methodology that could enable integration of information security management with enterprise life cycle processes. Over the years, the focus of information security evolved from physical security of computer centers to securing information technology systems and networks, to securing business information systems. With the Internet, computers can communicate and share information with other computers outside organization's networks. This meant that the existing security model was inadequate to meet the threats and challenges inherent in this new technology infrastructure. A new approach to information security management is needed to meet these security challenges. A meta model for the information security management viewpoint, developed in this research, includes various meta primitives, namely; business strategy and mission, security management goals and objectives, security management system, security management program, information security framework, security process improvement model with supporting methodology, and enterprise business systems. The elements of the architecture framework in this research are stakeholder, principles, purpose, level of abstraction, organization layer, context, representation scheme, modeling scheme, standards, and the required technology. An information security management process model in this research consists of four major phases, namely; planning, analysis and design, implementation, and operations and a process improvement sub-phase. Dissertation research results so far indicate a conceptual model that includes other security management models that are beyond the scope of this paper. © 2007 EDSIG.","Architecture framework; Enterprise security; Information security management; Process improvement; Security process model; Security viewpoint","Industrial management; Information systems; Management information systems; Network architecture; Research; Security of data; Architecture frameworks; Enterprise security; Information security managements; Process Improvement; Process model; Security viewpoint; Information management"

The practitioners in this field have been motivated to use multiple sources for increased information assurance due to the fact that a single sensor cannot detect all types of attacks. Information from multiple sources can collaborate with or complement each other to provide increased assurance of information. However, managing information from multiple sources is not trivial and requires special consideration. In this paper we address the problem of fusing information from multiple sources for overall situation assessment in an intrusion detection environment that employs anomaly sensors. In this respect, we use a possibilistic approach in intelligent fusion of sensor alerts in order to accommodate the impreciseness and vagueness in knowledge-based reasoning. Experiments show that fusing data with sensor corroboration provides further more insight into the overall situation assessment.","Anomaly detection; Network security; Possibilistic fusion; Sensor corroboration","Computer applications; Intrusion detection; Network security; Anomaly detection; Information assurance; Intrusion Detection Systems; Knowledge-based reasoning; Network defense systems; Possibilistic; Possibilistic approach; Situation assessment; Sensors"

Currently major implementations of RFID in logistics and NFC-based ticketing and payment solutions are under preparation. Especially above mentioned prominent projects have been confronted with significant public criticism. Influencial parts of the society and the authorities had and still have the perception that contactless chip technology and RFID may not be secure and mature. This leads to the following situation: 1. Uncertainties concerning public response and customer acceptance are hampering the introduction of RFID systems 2. The data protection authorities are proposing dedicated legal rules for RFID usage. By launching the project Technical Guidelines RFID"" the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) suggests an approach that considers and fulfills the legitimate interest of all involved parties: Citizens resp. customers, service providers and suppliers of RFID systems. This year BSI will issue 4 Technical Guidelines for usage of contactless chip technology and RFID in major application areas: Event Ticketing, Ticketing in Public Transport, NFC-based Ticketing and Logistics. These Technical Guidelines will contain technical advice on how to implement a system in a functional, secure and economically viable way. Potential threats for the system owner and the users are depicted, discussed and countered by appropreate security measures. Remaining risks will be described. All proposed solutions are based on standards or open specifications. Gaining the acceptance from all parties is the most important project goal. An open discussion and integration of all potential contributors is a corner stone of BSI's concept. Therefore the Technical Guidelines are currently being drafted in close cooperations with leading companies from the respective application domains. These drafts have been discussed in dedicated expert workshops where all relevant groups -incl. the critics- were present. The final versions will include the comments gathered in these sessions. In future BSI and probably also accredited evaluation facilities will offer a certification service / quality seal for implementations that follow the guidelines. The Technical Guidelines will serve as comprehensive and neutral information source for German citizens, service providers and industry. This will build transparency and trust. NXP Semiconductors is working the project on behalf of BSI.","","Certification services; Contactless chip technology; Customer acceptance; Economically viable; Electronic passports; Information sources; Smart-card technology; Technical guidelines; Security of data"

High power radio frequency generators possess the ability to disrupt, and deny service to information systems and processes by adversely affecting sensitive electronic hardware. The manifestation of such an attack form is ambiguous and open to misinterpretation and as such the attack or crime may go undetected, or be incorrectly diagnosed. Further, incorrect diagnosis of an EM disruption incident may lead to an incorrect or inappropriate response which could lead to magnification of the impact with potential cost penalties. An Electromagnetic Disruption Detection System (EMDDS) prototype has been developed similar in function to conventional cyber Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The EMDDS raises an alarm when hostile activity, EM disruption, is taking, or has taken place. This paper discusses; EM disruptive threat types; the impact on INFOSEC; the potential types of criminal activity; the merits of detection; and the application of the EMDDS to a forensic investigation and for incident response.","Electromagnetic pulse weapons; Forensics","Crime; Electromagnetism; Security of data; Cost penalty; Criminal activities; Cyber intrusion; Detection system; Electronic hardwares; Forensic investigation; Forensics; Incident response; Radio frequency generators; Electromagnetic pulse"

This paper shows how information security can be successfully realised in automotive systems. In particular the following three starting points for information security are addressed:. Product, i.e., assuring information security for systems, Process, i.e., implementing information security concepts during development, Field, i.e., ensuring information security concepts are applied during after sales activities. Our experiences underline that Information security can be achieved straight forward using a modest amount of effort based on an established quality management as is nowadays typical in many automotive development processes.","","Automotive industry; Marketing; Quality management; Automotive development processes; Automotive information security; Sales activities; Security of data"

The bureaucracy arises largely as a result of misinterpretation of the standard and results from poor information security management process design and the use of inappropriate language in the risk assessment phase. ISO 27001 mandates the implementation of the following information security management processes: risk assessment, risk treatment, management review, internal audit, training and awareness, and incident management. However, in a SME these processes can be combined in a number of different ways to reduce the bureaucratic overhead and yet still construct an ISO 27001 compliant management system. The bureaucratic burden can be further reduced by tight implementation within the existing business processes. In particular, the bureaucracy of risk assessment can be reduced in two ways: by using linguistic metaphors appropriate for SMEs instead of the specialist language that is traditionally employed for information security risk assessment, and by combining risk assessment with a reflexive management review process. This paper presents a number of models for combining information security management processes and provides a number of case studies to show how these combined information security management processes can be implemented within standard business processes. The paper also offers a taxonomy of linguistic metaphors designed to be used in information security risk assessment in the SME.","Information security management system; Isms, small-to-medium size enterprise, SME","Industrial economics; Industrial management; Linguistics; Risk assessment; Security of data; Assessment phase; Business Process; Combined informations; Incident Management; Information security management systems; Information security managements; Information security risk assessment; Internal audit; Isms, small-to-medium size enterprise, SME; Management review; Management systems; Poor information; Risk treatment; Information management"

In this article, we focus on the management aspect of information security governance. Different organizational arrangements (i.e., governance arrangements) are possible to manage and implement the security strategy. One arrangement involves the creation of an information security department with a chief information security officer (CISO), or equivalent, to highlight the importance of security. Unfortunately, this may also create the impression that security is the responsibility of a special group and has little to do with the average employee. At the other extreme, no special security department is created. Instead, all employees have a significant role in maintaining information security in the organization. Such an arrangement may be more suited to implement guidelines, which suggest that security features are better built into business processes and software, rather than incorporated as an add-on layer. This arrangement diffuses the responsibility for security, and has the potential for diluting top management attention to security. In this research-in-progress paper, we propose a study to examine the effects of different governance arrangements.","Chief information security officer; Information security governance","Information systems; Business Process; Chief information security officers; Information security governance; Security departments; Security features; Security strategies; Top management; Security of data"

At the same time, security attacks against these applications have also grown being more sophisticated and are quite difficult to detect and withstand, especially distributed attacks. In this paper, we argue that one way to identify and mitigate such attacks is through the trust-based collaboration of application components. However, to achieve collaborative defense in distributed environments, a common vocabulary is needed for the components to collaborate with each other in identifying security incidents. Thus, we employ an ontological approach to define security ontologies as a common vocabulary that is understandable for both humans and software agents. Further, we introduce basic security concepts and trust implications, explain our security ontologies (specified in OWL) that include the security asset-vulnerability ontology (SAVO), the security algorithm-standard ontology (SASO), the security function ontology (SFO), and the security attack and defence ontologies (SAO and SDO respectively). Trust is also examined while its dimensions are employed to create trust-based communications used to distribute security ontologies. We use a case study involving Mitnick attacks to demonstrate our approach. © 2007 Artem Vorobiev and Nargiza Bekmamedova.","Information security; Security attacks; Security defenses; Security ontology; Trust","Information systems; Security of data; Software agents; Application components; Distributed attack; Distributed environments; Ontological approach; Security attacks; Security defense; Security functions; Security incident; Software applications; Trust; Ontology"

The need for a common international standard drove the development of the Common Criteria, which has now been the predominant standard for 10 years. CC has never penetrated the non-Defence marketplace and, with the growing interest in Information Security in relation to corporate governance, there is an increasing need for independent commercial assurance. In the UK this gap has been filled by the CSIA Claims Tested (CCT) Mark. In the future it is expected that the trend will be towards holistic, through-life assurance, rather than a specific concentration on product evaluation, possibly in line with the evolving UK Assurance model.","","Security systems; Common criteria; Corporate governance; International standards; IT security; Product evaluation; Security evaluation; Specific concentration; Security of data"

Member companies in such an extended enterprise or ""business network"" are either forced or volunteer to meet certain security objectives as a whole. As a consequence, the business network needs to agree on a common strategy, joint processes and technical interfaces to meet regulatory or voluntary requirements from industry standards. Reality shows that - even if standards exist - they are not harmonized and access and reconciliation between partners is sometimes legally, if not technically impossible, or simply too expensive. The serious and economic assessment of risks, already tough on the internal scale, becomes almost an insurmountable obstacle when considering the entire business network. This paper's objective is to emphasize the importance of security in business networks for research and practice. Since there is little research available, it raises major questions to be answered by a future research agenda. A basic research framework is derived based on related research, an observation of the interdependencies of firms and a series of cases from different industry sectors.

The collection of information for the sake of knowing is hard to justify to a company that carefully monitors its expenditures. Depending on the type and size of the business, there may be many business partners struggling with how exactly they may scope the risk. A physical security detachment may be concerned about the safety, health, and welfare of the company employees. Information security teams worry about threats, both external and internal, to a company that may cause a loss of availability, reliability, or confidentiality of their information resources. Each partner may have at its disposal many sources of information particular to its needs. A truly effective plan would cut across the silos of information to develop a more detailed understanding of threats, and how those threats would manifest themselves to the risk partners and company. To be effective in developing a program for a company, the facilitator leading the charge should have buy-in from executive management, spend time understanding the needs of all the potential customers and stakeholders of intelligence products, clearly identify the requirements needed to be successful for the customer, do an inventory of the information sources already available within the organization, learn what sources are needed to complete the program, develop clear collection plans and sensible analysis techniques, and deliver clear reporting that is timely and meets the expectations of the clients. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Universities teach the technology and tactics for detecting and preventing attacks on our systems. Hardware and software engineers are moving deliberately to increase capabilities in secure systems. Ultimately, however, these groups implement design specifications that began as an analysis of a business need or opportunity. Separate surveys of IS faculty and students reveal a recognition by both groups that IA design is critical and will be important to future employers. This paper discusses the dichotomy between existing systems analysis and design (SA&D) principles as depicted in many popular textbooks with the emerging need for secure information systems design. A review of 16 SA&D textbooks illustrates that although they provide a good foundation for the design process, they rarely include more than a page or two on IA considerations. Incorporating IA in systems analysis and design is no longer an option for our students. IS faculty must provide the formal curriculum for proper application of IA technologies in final systems implementation. We propose embedding IA in all sections of SA&D curricula, and provide a description of our approach to testing a methodology we are developing for secure SA&D courses.","","Curricula; Design; Information systems; Management information systems; Teaching; Textbooks; Business needs; Design process; Design specification; Existing systems; Hardware and software; Information assurance; Secure system; Systems analysis and design; Systems implementation; Systems analysis"

The need for CBIS emerged as most armed forces have to deal with several different network environments with different security classifications. This becomes a problem both with respect to cost efficiency and usability. Deploying CBIS, however, would make it possible to rely on only one physical network while maintaining several logical environments on top. As the information is encrypted at its source according to its classification level and ""need to know"" criteria, then access control is about managing who is able to decrypt the information and under what circumstances. This means that the information, in its encrypted form, can be freely distributed over the physical network. Furthermore, the granularity of information access can be controlled in such a way that e.g. a document may contain parts with various security classifications; the user is able to see only the parts to which his classification level allows. This paper defines CBIS as part of a functional security architecture and investigates how information (a document and its metadata) consisting of multiple parts, each having their specific requirements to access control, integrity and non-repudiability, can be cryptographically constructed. The cryptographical construction is necessary, since the document is distributed freely without an active system enforcing security properties. A large part of the document security management procedures is related to key management. The paper outlines, how identity based PKI can efficiently be used to implement document life cycle management for confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiability.","Access control; Content based information security; Identity based PKI; Key management; XML","Access control; Classification (of information); Cryptography; Information retrieval; Metadata; XML; Active systems; Armed forces; Content-based information; Cost efficiency; Document life-cycle; Document security; Identity-based; Information access; Key management; Large parts; Multiple parts; Network environments; Non-repudiability; Physical network; Roadmap; Security Architecture; Security classification; Security properties; Information retrieval systems"

Every level of management, starting with the board of directors, must play a vital role in this effort.","","Risk management; Security of data; Security systems; Business objectives; Educational resource; Executive management; Information security governance; Performance measurements; Resource management; Security strategies; Strategic alignment; Information management"

In order to ensure that employees comply with the organization's information security procedures, a number of information security policy compliance measures have been proposed in the past. Prior research has, however, criticized these measures as lacking theoretically and empirically grounded principles. To fill this gap in research, the present study advances a novel model that explains employees' adherence to information security policies. This model modifies and combines the Protection Motivation Theory, the General Deterrence Theory, the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Innovation Diffusion Theory and Rewards. In order to empirically validate this model, we collected data (N=917) from four different companies. The findings show that direct paths from threat appraisal, self-efficacy, normative beliefs, and visibility to the intention to comply with IS security policies were significant. Response efficacy, on the other hand, did not have a significant effect on the intention to comply with IS security policies. Sanctions have a significant effect on actual compliance with IS security policies, whereas rewards did not have a significant effect on actual compliance with the IS security policies. Finally, the intention to comply with IS security policies has a significant effect on actual compliance with the IS security policies.","General deterrence theory; Information security compliance; Protection motivation theory","Information systems; Motivation; Security systems; Direct paths; Empirical studies; General deterrence theory; Information security compliance; Information security policies; Innovation diffusion theory; Protection motivation theory; Security policy; Self efficacy; Theory of reasoned action; Security of data"

These are aspects of what we teach that pervade and tie together the IT discipline, aspects whose understanding identifies the IT professional. Pervasive themes can be characterized (Meyer,Land[14]) as transformative (change how students think), irreversible (once understood, are never forgotten), integrative (provide a framework for understanding previous concepts), bounding (serve as discipline boundaries in that understanding them identifies someone as a member of the discipline), troublesome (are difficult to teach and learn). This paper illustrates each of these characteristics using the IT pervasive themes and then proposes that an essential aspect of a pervasive theme is that it has an affective component. That is, in addition to cognitive elements (knowledge and intellectual skills), a pervasive theme includes educational objectives that treat values and attitudes. Just as cognitive objectives have a well-known hierarchy of cognitive difficulty, so also affective objectives have a (less well-known) hierarchy of increasing value commitment in which affective objectives can be placed and classified.

Earlier work in the area has been mostly based on the system level detection. The results aim at bringing out the limitations in the current honeypot technology. This paper also describes the results concerning the robustness and generalization capabilities of kernel methods in detecting honeypots using system and network finger printing data. We use traditional support vector machines (SVM), biased support vector machine (BSVM) and leave-one-out model selection for support vector machines (looms) for model selection. We also evaluate the impact of kernel type and parameter values on the accuracy of a support vector machine (SVM) performing honeypot classification. Through a variety of comparative experiments, it is found that SVM performs the best for data sent on the same network; BSVM performs the best for data sent from a remote network. ©2007 IEEE.","","Flow interactions; Gears; Image retrieval; Ketones; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Printing; Vectors; Virtual reality; Comparative experiments; Feature sets; Finger printing; Generalization capabilities; Honeypot; Honeypots; Information assurance (IA); Kernel methods; Leave-one-out (LOO); Low-interaction honeypots; Model selections; Network level; Parameter values; Support Vector Machine (SVM); Support vector machines ((SVM)); System levels; Vector machines; Virtual environments (VE); Support vector machines"

Unlike other spread spectrum based data-hiding algorithms, the proposed algorithm does not introduce a low-pass filtering effect in the histogram of the stego image. The distance between the center of gravity (CoG) as defined by [14] of the unmarked host and the stego images was reduced by 74% in the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm is also resilient against the Chi-Square attack and does not compromise on robustness or capacity to achieve this goal. When compared to the generic block based DCT data-hiding scheme, the proposed algorithm provides a 41% reduction in the relative entropy between the host and stego images. In other words, the proposed algorithm is 41% more secure than generic DCT based data-hiding algorithms when measured in terms of relative entropy. The proposed algorithm also provides statistical resilience against a steganalysis attack specifically designed for block DCT datahiding algorithms [29]. The proposed algorithm is robust against a variety of image manipulating attacks such as noise addition, filtering, blurring, sharpening, JPEG compression etc. In the cases of dislocating attacks such as blurring and despeckling, the bit error ratio (BER) was 0.1045 and 0.0435 respectively, thereby yielding retrieval rates of over 89% and 95% respectively. In the case of low quality JPEG attack (Q-30) the retrieval rate was 92%. In the case of noise addition attacks, the retrieval rates were more than 92%.","Data-hiding; Information security; Multimedia security; Steganography","Discrete cosine transforms; Entropy; Image compression; Security of data; Spectroscopy; Steganography; Bit error ratio (BER); Block based; Block DCT; Center of gravity; Data-hiding; Dct-based; De-speckling; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); JPEG compression; Low qualities; Low-pass filtering; Multimedia security; Noise addition; Relative entropy; Retrieval rate; Spread spectra; Statistical attacks; Steganalysis attacks; Stego image; Algorithms"

The rootkit can be placed on a computer by a hacker that gains unauthorized access to a computer, or by an unsuspecting authorized user that allows a virus or other malicious software to insert the rootkit into their computer. Cyberspace is full of threats and risks. Each danger must be carefully considered and protected against only to the extent that is reasonable and affordable in accordance with a prudent risk management program. When considering rootkits a risk manager will ask: How common are they? How severe are the consequences? How can they be prevented? How can they be removed? These general questions have been explored in a number of research projects and publications. At a finer level of detail and on a recurring basis, information assurance managers will also ask 'as of right now': How hard are they to create? How available is rootkit source code? How hard are they to install and operate? This paper describes a research project at Murray State University in which faculty and senior undergraduate students explored this second set of more time-sensitive questions. It describes both the pedagogical and technical issues of having students find rootkit source code on the web; getting the source code to run and operate in an academic laboratory without threatening the university's IT environment; and exploring what tools and techniques are currently available for detecting and removing rootkits.

This promise, however, is offset by important security concerns. The resource constraints that typify wireless sensor devices make traditional security solutions impractical. One threat to secure sensor networks is the replay attack, in which packets are captured and replayed into the network. This type of attack can be perpetrated to confuse observers or to mount a denial-of-service or denial-of-sleep attack. Traditional techniques for anti-replay protection are too resource intensive for large-scale WSN deployments. While techniques for reducing data transmission overhead of WSN-specific anti-replay mechanisms have been explored, the important problem of minimizing per-node reply table storage requirements has not been addressed. This paper introduces Clustered Anti-Replay Protection or CARP, which leverages sensor network clustering to place a limit on the amount of memory required to store anti-replay information. We show that clustering keeps the memory required for anti-replay tables manageable, reducing the size from 30% of a Mica2's memory to 4.4% for a 200-node network. While the advantages of this technique are clear, the difficulty lies in securely updating network-wide anti-replay tables when the network reclusters, an event that must happen routinely to distribute energy consumption across the nodes in the network. Our mechanism distributes necessary anti-replay information in a secure, low-overhead, and completely distributed manner. We further show the energy-consumption overhead of adding anti-replay counters to network traffic across several WSN medium access control (MAC) protocols and two representative WSN platforms. On the Mica2 platform, overheads range from a 0% to 1.32% decrease in network lifetime, depending on the MAC protocol. On the Tmote Sky, overheads range from 0% to 4.64%. Providing anti-replay support in a secure, scalable, and distributed way is necessary to the overall security of future WSN deployments if they are to meet current expectations. ©2007 IEEE.","Anti-replay; Security; Sensor networks","Access control; Cluster analysis; Data storage equipment; Detectors; Electric breakdown; Energy policy; Flow of solids; Hybrid sensors; Internet; Mechanisms; Medium access control; Military applications; Network protocols; Routing protocols; Security systems; Sensor networks; Sensors; Telecommunication networks; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cluster-based; Data transmissions; Denial of service (Dos); Distributed way; Energy consumption; Homeland security (HLS); Information assurance (IA); Mac protocols; Medium access control (MAC) protocols; Network clustering; Network life-time; Network traffics; Replay attacks; Resource constraints; Resource intensive; Secure sensor networks; Security Solution (TSS); Storage requirements; Traditional techniques; Wireless sensor devices; Wireless sensor network (WNS); Wireless sensors; Wireless sensor networks"

One is the techniques about discerning two classes with different features, another is the construction/selection of the observed sample of normally occurring patterns for system normality characterization. In this paper, instead of focusing on the design of specific anomaly detection models, we restrict our attention to the analysis of the anomaly detector's operating environments, which facilitates us to insight into anomaly detectors' operational capabilities, including their detection coverage and blind spots, and thus to evaluate them in convincing manners. Taking the similarity with the induction problem as the starting point, we cast anomaly detection in a statistical framework, which gives a formal analysis of anomaly detector's anticipated behavior from a high level. Some existing problems and possible solutions about the normality characterization for the observable subjects that from hosts and networks are addressed respectively. As case studies, several typical anomaly detectors are analyzed and compared from the prospective of their operating environments, especially those factors causing their special detection coverage or blind spots. Moreover, the evaluation of anomaly detectors are also roughly discussed based on some existing benchmarks. Careful analysis shows that the fundamental understanding of the operating environments (i.e., properties of observable subjects) is the elementary but essential stage in the process of establishing an effective anomaly detection model, which therefore worth insightful exploration, especially when we face the dilemma between anomaly detection performance and the computational cost.","Anomaly detection; Computer security; Information security; Intrusion detection; Misuse detection","Detectors; Security of data; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection models; Anomaly detector; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Blind spots; Computational costs; Detection coverage; Existing problems; Formal analysis; Keypoints; Misuse detection; Observation-centric analysis; Observed samples; Operating environment; Operational capabilities; Statistical framework; Intrusion detection"

In this paper, we describe the weakness of Lee-Lee's scheme and also propose an improved scheme with better security strength. © 2007 IEEE.","","Access control; Authentication; Information services; Security of data; Authenticated key agreement; Improved scheme; Information security systems; International conferences; Key agreement; Key agreement scheme; Mutual authentication; Network environments; Off-line password guessing attacks; Pervasive Computing; Security requirements; Security strengths; Laws and legislation"

They have been gaining popularity due to their high potential in widespread applications and becoming more realizable due to the rapid advancements in wireless communication and data transfer technologies. This paper addresses the issue of D-NCS information security as well its real-time performance with respect to network security protocols and encryption schemes. We use a wireless network based, robot navigation path tracking system called Intelligent Space (iSpace) as a D-NCS test bed in this paper. The paper classifies the data from every NCS module (sensors, actuators and controllers) according to bandwidth requirement, time and information sensitivity. We define performance parameters for this NCS test bed. Various system factors affecting these performance parameters are recognized. Network security algorithms DES and 3DES are integrated with the application to encrypt the sensitive information flow. These wireless security features are considered as an added factor to the NCS. Standard statistical approach (2k factorial experiment design) is used to study and estimate the effect of each factor on the system performance especially security additions. Thorough experimental results, tables of detailed characterization and effect estimate analysis is presented followed by the discussion on the performance comparison of NCS with and without wireless security. ©2007 IEEE.","Data security; Data-sensitive wireless network; Distributed networked-control-system; iSpace","Actuators; Control systems; Cryptography; Data transfer; Electronics industry; Equipment testing; Industrial electronics; Information services; Internet; Nanostructured materials; Navigation; Network security; Object recognition; Parameter estimation; Real time systems; Security of data; Sensor networks; Sensors; Standards; Technology; Technology transfer; Telecommunication; Testing; Annual conference; Bandwidth requirements; Con trol algorithms; Data security; Data-sensitive wireless network; Distributed networked-control-system; Distributed networks; Encryption schemes; High potential; Information security; Information sensitivity; Integrating sensors; Intelligent space; iSpace; Network based; Network structures; Network-security protocols; Paper addresses; Path tracking; Performance Assessment; Performance parameters; Real-time applications; Real-time operations; Real-time performance; Robot navigation; Security algorithms; Sensitive informations; Statistical approaches; Test beds; Widespread applications; Wireless communication; Wireless security; Wireless networks"

These models can be categorized by either their protection objective or by the process they follow. In recent years there has been a wider acceptance that information systems need a more holistic approach. However, these holistic models lack the ability to be straightforwardly transferable into specific context in enough detail to be easily adopted into the medical environment. Subsequently, models for medical security have been developed but these models suffer from being too technically based for adoption into a non-technical environment. Whilst security models for information exchange require this level of technicality, it makes them unsuitable for use in an overall information systems context. Thus, risk assessment has been used extensively in research solutions for medical information security. These models are discussed to highlight that no one model is at a sufficiently low level of sophistication to be integrated into general medical practice workflow. Consequently, a new holistic perspective of information security is required to be relevant in the general medical practice environment.","Computer security; Data security; Information systems; Medical services; Modeling","Bioinformatics; Information systems; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security systems; Computer security; Data security; Holistic approaches; Holistic models; Information exchanges; Information securities; Low levels; Medical informations; Medical practices; Medical securities; Medical services; Modeling; Security models; Technical environments; Security of data"

In a recent work, Huang and Wang proposed a new nominative signature scheme which, in addition to the above properties, only allows the nominee to convert a nominative signature to a publicly verifiable one. In ACISP 2005, Susilo and Mu presented several algorithms and claimed that these algorithms can be used by the nominator to verify the validity of a published nominative signature, show to a third party that the signature is valid, and also convert the signature to a publicly verifiable one, all without any help from the nominee. In this paper, we point out that Sušilo and Mu's attacks are actually incomplete and inaccurate. In particular, we show that there exists no efficient algorithm for a nominator to check the validity of a signature if this signature is generated by the nominator and the nominee honestly and the Decisional Diffie-Hellman Problem is hard. On the other hand, we point out that the Huang-Wang scheme is indeed insecure, since there is an attack that allows the nominator to generate valid nominative signatures alone and prove the validity of such signatures to a third party.","Attack; Digital signature; Information security; Nominative signature; Privacy","Authentication; Attack; Digital signature; Information security; Nominative signature; Privacy; Electronic document identification systems"

Traditionally database security focused on user authentication and managing user privileges to database objects. This has proven to be inadequate given the growing number of successful database hacking incidents and the increase in the number of organizations reporting loss of sensitive data. It is becoming imperative for students in the computing disciplines to develop an understanding of the issues and challenges related to database security and their possible solutions. This paper describes a set of database security and integrity software animations currently being developed to enhance an Animated Database Courseware (ADbC) tool developed at Kennesaw State University and made freely available at http://coffee.kennesaw.edu. The ADbC, initially funded by the NSF, was built to complement introductory database texts or DBMS instructional materials and consists of three main modules: Database Design, SQL, and Transaction Processing. Currently the ADbC contains over 70 programs including tutorials, animations and other exercises. Animations related to database security include topics related to referential integrity, row level security, inference problems, SQL injections and security matrices. Incorporating the use of animations in the instructional process helps to enhance and enrich the standard presentation of important concepts. Further, complementary software animations can be effective at reinforcing topics introduced in the classroom as they provide a venue for practice and feedback. This paper describes a set of software animations related to database security and integrity constraints that can be used to extend student understanding of these important concepts.

The watermarking and encryption used together is more and more important in Digital Multimedia Security (DMS) application. So in this paper, a novel approximation zero-tree-wise wavelet watermarking with Difference Chaos Shift Key coding encryption method of DMS information security is present. Firstly the DMS information is got by proprietor or authority as initial watermarks. Then encrypt key is generated by DM's data. To encrypt initial watermarks' information is to apply chaos sequence as final watermarks' information. Then the final watermark is embedded into the approximation zero-tree-wise wavelet coefficients of the image by Digital Chaos Shift Key (DCSK) coding method that makes watermarks' information more secure and secret. The Chaos key is generated automatically by image decomposed with LUT mapped. As a result, approximation zero-tree-wise wavelet with DCSK coding watermarking is more secure and secret characteristic in protecting DMS information. Furthermore blind-detection watermarking can be achieved, encrypt key can be regain by DM data.

Many measures have been designed and developed to guard against threats from outsider attacks. Technologies are commonly implemented to actively prohibit unauthorized connection and/or limit access to corporate internal resources; however, threats from insiders are even more subtle and complex. Personnel whom are inherently trusted have valuable internal corporate knowledge that could impact profits or organizational integrity. They are often a source of potential threat within the corporation, through leaking or damaging confidential and sensitive information-whether intentionally or unintentionally. Identifying and detecting anomalous personnel behavior and potential threats are concomitantly important. It can be done by observation and evaluation of communicated intentions and behavioral outcomes of the employee over time. While human observations are subject to fallibility and systems statistics are subject to false positives, personnel anomaly detection correlates observations on the change of personnel trustworthiness to provide for both corporate security and individual privacy. In this paper, insider threats are identified as one of the significant problems to corporate security. Some insightful discussions of personnel anomaly detection are provided, from both a social and a systems perspective. © 2008, IGI Global.","",""

Because of this perception, a growing body of research and commercial activity is focused on automated approaches to security. With these approaches, security decisions are removed from the hands of the users, and are placed instead in systems themselves, or in remote services or organizations that establish policies that are automatically enforced. We contend that although security automation is potentially beneficial in theory, in practice it is not a panacea for end-user information security. A number of technical and social factors mitigate against the acceptance and efficacy of automated end-user security solutions in many cases. In this paper, we present a discussion of the inherent limitations of automating security for end-users. We then discuss a set of design guidelines for choosing whether to automate end-user security systems. We conclude with a set of research directions focused on increasing the acceptance and efficacy of security solutions for end-users.

One essential security weakness in our modern systems having huge number of units such as mobile and e-commerce systems is the difficulty of managing secured and provable-identities for all participating entities in the system. In other words a biological DNA-like identification mechanism is still missing. This paper is proposing a set of security requirements and proposes a technology resulting with DNA-like electronic identity called ""e-Mutation"" and correspondingly e-DNA. The e-DNA identity is a self-created identity which should be autonomously generated by any security-relevant entity in a system, such that it is even infeasible for the unit manufacturer to create the same identity. Cryptographic mechanisms are proposed showing possible real-world realization possibilities. Once DNA-like identity is made available in a system, a very solid traceable security system could be realized. Many legal and criminal issues in connection with mass public-commerce and mobile systems could probably be more easily resolved by using such information security means. The proposed e-Mutation system is initiated originally for e-commerce applications; however it appears to be of general interest for a wide range of modern security systems. ©2007 IEEE.","","Applications; Commerce; Computer networks; Electronic commerce; Information services; Mechanisms; Nucleic acids; Organic acids; Security systems; Signal processing; International symposium; Security requirements; Genes"

There are no known methods for achieving jam resistance without that shared key. Unfortunately, wireless communication is now reaching a scale and a level of importance where such secret-key systems are becoming impractical. For example, the civilian side of the Global Positioning System (GPS) cannot use a shared secret, since that secret would have to be given to all 6.5 billion potential users, and so would no longer be secret. So civilian GPS cannot currently be protected from jamming. But the FAA has stated that the civilian airline industry will transition to using GPS for all navigational aids, even during landings. A terrorist with a simple jamming system could wreak havoc at a major airport. No existing system can solve this problem, and the problem itself has not even been widely discussed. The problem of keyless jam resistance is important. There is a great need for a system that can broadcast messages without any prior secret shared between the sender and receiver. We propose the first system for keyless jam resistance: the BBC algorithm. We describe the encoding, decoding, and broadcast algorithms. We then analyze it for expected resistance to jamming and error rates. We show that BBC can achieve the same level of jam resistance as traditional spread spectrum systems, at just under half the bit rate, and with no shared secret. Furthermore, a hybrid system can achieve the same average bit rate as traditional systems. ©2007 IEEE.","","Decoding; Electric grounding; Electronic warfare; Error analysis; Global positioning system; Jamming; Military operations; Navigation; Radio broadcasting; Radio communication; Satellite navigation aids; Telecommunication; Tracking (position); Airline industry; Billion (CO); Bit rate (bpp); Broadcast algorithms; Broadcast messages; Error Rate (ER); Existing systems; Hybrid system (HS); Information assurance (IA); Key systems; Navigational aids; Positioning systems; Potential users; Radio frequency (RF) communications; Secret keys; Spread spectrum (SS) system; Traditional systems; Transition (Jel Classifications:E52 ,E41 ,E31); Wireless (WiFi) communication; Health"

Access control is part of this last process that checks if a user can access those resources. This is particularly important in the healthcare environment where there is the need to control access to Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Although EMR can be an important support tool for the healthcare professional there are some barriers that prevent its successful integration. These barriers include the fact that healthcare professionals do not participate in the development of access control to access the EMR imposing them extra effort in its use. New access control policies to be implemented should focus on human processes and needs. The main objective of this project is to reduce EMR barriers by including healthcare professionals and patients in the definition and improvement of access control policies and models.

Customers asking for safety and quality become interested in where products or produce come from. Therefore, goods should be rightly transported and delivered to customers. However, goods sometimes go missing in transportation or are delivered to wrong destination in existing physical distribution. Goods are usually packaged individually and then these packages are put together in a cardboard box. Several of the boxes are put together on a pallet and wound with plastic tape. Several of the pallets are put in a container etc. Thus, nested wrapping makes traceability unreliable in physical distribution. And what is worse, most of ports and markets are scarcely equipped with network infrastructure. The proposed method makes it possible to authenticate these nested items by checking only once. An electronic signature attached on a box certifies all items inside the box without opening it, and the items are traceable even after they are parted. Moreover, the signature in the method certifies products without any connection to the ID database. The proposed method doesn't exclude existing standard labelling in physical distribution. It will help and contribute to physical distribution in the future.","2D code; Authentication; Cellular technology; Information security","ABS resins; Authentication; Communication; Communication systems; Network protocols; Pallets; Plastic tapes; Sensor networks; 2D code; Authentication methods; Cardboard boxes; Cellular technology; Electronic signatures; Information security; Network infrastructures; Access control"

The proposed architecture utilizes DNP3 to produce a disjoint protocol between strictly-regulated utility devices and devices accessible by the utility and consumers. The disjoint protocol limits the effectiveness of attacks originated from the consumer TCP/IP access to a device into the utility network. Since DNP3 does not provide sufficient security, security enhancements to DNP3 are proposed using data object security and a security layer. The data object security provides data access rules to a device, preventing unauthorized manipulation of device operations and data. The security layer provides confidentiality through encryption between devices for consumer personal privacy and to prevent cyber-attackers from identifying potential utility targets. © 2007 IEEE.","Computer network management; Computer network security; Computer networks; Power system communication; Power system security; Protocols; Security","Cryptography; Electric power distribution; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Laws and legislation; Network architecture; Weight control; Communication security; Computer network management; Computer network security; Computer networks; Cyber-security; Data access; Device operations; Distributed networks; Distribution systems; Electrical power; Personal privacy; Power system communication; Power system security; Proposed architectures; Protocols; Security; Security enhancements; Utility networks; Utility targeting; Security of data"

Comprehensive solutions to data security are quite complicated and require the integration of different tools and techniques as well as specific organizational processes. In such a context, a fundamental role is played by the access control system (ACS) that establishes which subjects are authorized to perform which operations on which objects. Subjects are individuals or programs or other entities requiring access to the protected resources. When dealing with protection of information, the resources of interest are typically objects that record information, such as files in an operating system, tuples in a relational database, or a complex object in an object database. Because of its relevance in the context of solutions for information security, access control has been extensively investigated for database management systems (DBMSs) [6], digital libraries [3, 14], and multimedia applications [24]. Yet, the importance of the spatial dimension in access control has been highlighted only recently. We say that access control has a spatial dimension when the authorization to access a resource depends on position information.We broadly categorize spatially aware access control as object-driven, subject-driven, and hybrid based on whether the position information concerns objects, subjects, or both, respectively. In the former case, the spatial dimension is introduced because of the spatial nature of resources. For example, if the resources are georeferenced Earth images, then we can envisage an individual be allowed to only display images covering a certain region. The spatial dimension may also be required because of the spatial nature of subjects. This is the case of mobile individuals allowed to access a resource when located in a given area. For example, an individual may be authorized to view secret information only within a military base. Finally, position information may concern both objects and subjects like in the case of an individual authorized to display images of a region only within a military office. There is a wide range of applications which motivate spatially aware access control. The two challenging and contrasting applications we propose as examples 190 Maria Luisa Damiani and Elisa Bertino are the spatial data infrastructures (SDI) and location-based services (LBS). An SDI consists of the technological and organizational infrastructure which enables the sharing and coordinated maintenance of spatial data among multiple heterogeneous organizations, primarily public administrations, and government agencies. On the other side, LBS enable mobile users equipped with location-aware terminals to access information based on the position of terminals. These applications have different requirements on access control. In an SDI, typically, there is the need to account for various complex structured spatial data that may have multiple representations across different organizations. In an SDI, the access control is thus object-driven. Conversely, in LBS, there is the need to account for a dynamic and mobile user population which may request diversified services based on position. Access control is thus subject-driven or hybrid. However, despite the variety of requirements and the importance of spatial data protection in these and other applications, very few efforts have been devoted to the investigation of spatially aware access control models and systems. In this chapter, we pursue two main goals: the first is to present an overview of this emerging research area and in particular of requirements and research directions; the second is to analyze in more detail some research issues, focusing in particular on access control in LBS. We can expect LBS to be widely deployed in the near future when advanced wireless networks, such as mobile geosensor networks, and new positioning technologies, such as the Galileo satellite system will come into operation. In this perspective, access control will become increasingly important, especially for enabling selective access to services such as Enterprise LBS, which provide information services to mobile organizations, such as health care and fleet management enterprises. An access control model targeting mobile organizations is GEO-RBAC [4]. Such a model is based on the RBAC (role-based access control) standard and is compliant with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards with respect to the representation of the spatial dimension of the model. The main contributions of the chapter can be summarized as follows: • We provide an overview of the ongoing research in the field of spatially aware access control. • We show how the spatial dimension is interconnected with the security aspects in a specific access control model, that is, GEO-RBAC. • We outline relevant architectural issues related to the implementation of an ACS based on the GEO-RBAC model. In particular, we present possible strategies for security enforcement and the architecture of a decentralized ACS for large-scale LBS applications. The chapter is organized as follows. The next section provides some background knowledge on data security and in particular access control models. The subsequent section presents requirements for geospatial data security and then the state of the art. Afterward the GEO-RBAC model is introduced. In particular, we present the main concepts of the model defined in the basic layer of the model, the Core GEO-RBAC. Hence, architectural approaches supporting GEO-RBAC are presented. Open issues are finally reported in the concluding section along with directions for future work. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. All rights are reserved.","",""

Nevertheless, there are some different views on risk and risk mitigation in the two fields. The uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity and ripple effects of IT-risks are higher than for safety-related risks. As information technology converges with industrial safety systems, safety-related risk becomes more uncertain, complex and ambiguous as well. Information security management has traditionally utilized technological and passive administrative measures for risk mitigation, and lack the mature socio-technological perspectives of industrial safety. Due to integration of IT in industrial systems, information security becomes important for IT-based safety systems. This calls for a merged approach of industrial safety management and information security management with possibilities of experience-transfer between the domains. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group.","","Industrial management; Loss prevention; Management; Reliability; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security systems; Administrative measures; Basic ideas; Do-mains; Industrial safeties; Industrial systems; Information securities; Information Security managements; Related risks; Ripple effects; Risk characteristics; Risk mitigations; Safety systems; Technological perspectives; Decision making"

Through semi-structured interviews, the results of the study suggest that clients' needs and competitive advantage are the major reasons for implementing the standard. Furthermore, the implementation of the standard has increased the understanding of information security in all personnel groups and the understanding of security has broadened from the technical aspects to corporate security. As downsides of implementing the ISO/IEC 17799 standard, the costs and increased amount of work were mentioned as the worst. In addition, the difficulties in deploying the standard, and the readability of the standard were criticised.

With the ability to securely store data and execute functions on-card, smartcards can play an important role in providing secure solutions that are both highly usable and trusted, while preserving user privacy. However technological constraints currently prohibit computationally intensive applications on-card, making implementation a challenging problem: to date, current 'match-on-card' applications work by releasing a portion of the template into the off-card environment, thereby reintroducing significant security vulnerabilities. With the aim of developing a secure implementation of a biometric matching algorithm within a resource constrained environment, this paper establishes a disturbance rejection methodology capable of differentiating between equivalent and extraneous data. Initial studies demonstrate this novel concept is capable of yielding significant reductions in the magnitude of computation through the refinement of the feature search-space, opening up the prospect of truly secure 'match-on-card' systems.","Biometrics; Fingerprints; Information security; Match-on-card; Smartcards","Authentication; Disturbance rejection; Network security; Smart cards; Biometric matching; Efficient algorithms; Fingerprint authentications; Fingerprints; Information security; Match-on-card; Novel concepts; Resource-constrained; Secure implementations; Security vulnerabilities; Technological constraints; User privacies; Biometrics"

The trust in a typical web of trust is not transitive, however, making the construction of an application with strong assurance difficult or impossible. Instead, in this paper we examine a notion of weak assurance that can be provided by a web of trust, and might be ""good enough"" for many applications. As a motivating example, and to provide a more concrete basis for exposition, we present KeyChains, a peer-to-peer system that operates over a distributed web of trust to provide fully decentralized public key publishing and retrieval.

This paper studies a total yard operation inflow and outflow of containers and cargos where different stakeholders depend on the operation of off-dock terminal. The primary challenge is to efficiently operate the operations and acquire the real-time data to minimize the operation lag due to information passing delay. In particular, to automate the every process, an online activity base strategy is used. This strategy groups jointly co-operate with OLAP and data mining process to reduce the manual work. An approach has been introduced to automate the all operational activity of off-dock as well as container terminal in real time basis. The methodology is approaching a cost-effective and authenticated communication through different stake holders of container terminal i.e. Main Line Operator (MLO), Freight Forwarder, C&F Agents, Shipper, Consignee etc. The model is solved using message passing strategy. Due to required interaction and multiple hub access issues a standard structure is introduced with details specification. The communication architecture has implemented through the authenticated portable database tool, Extended Markup Language (XML). To establish the easy communication through the end point, email client is introduced. For ensuring the information security MD5 encryption method has also used. This approach helps to atomize the full industry segment to work in one umbrella. The standard message structure ensures data validity among the stakeholders. This approach also can be used to communicate within different application where this approach would be work as a communication agent. ©2007 IEEE.","Automation; Communication architecture; Container terminal; Data mining; Off-dock; OLAP","Agents; Computer networks; Containers; Cost effectiveness; Cryptography; Data mining; Database systems; Decision support systems; Docks; Hydraulic structures; Hypertext systems; Information management; Information services; Information technology; Markup languages; Message passing; Mining; Paper containers; Port terminals; Railroad yards and terminals; Security of data; Automation; Communication architecture; Container terminal; Off-dock; OLAP; Communication"

However, this requires that enterprises know in every moment their security maturity level and to what extend their information security system must evolve. In small and medium-sized enterprises, the application of security standards has an additional problem, which is the fact that they do not have enough resources to carry out an appropriate management. This security management system must have highly reduced costs for its implementation and maintenance in small and medium-sized enterprises (from here on refered to as SMEs) to be feasible.

This does not mean that the traditional forms of information security risk assessment should be replaced; on the contrary rigorous IT infrastructure risk assessment is fundamental to good security management.

However, previous research has largely overlooked the development of such a culture for SMEs, and the national context in which SMEs operate. The paper explores this topic and provides key findings from an interpretive Australian study based on a literature review, two focus groups and three case studies. A holistic framework is provided for fostering an information security culture in SMEs in a national setting. The paper discusses key managerial challenges for SMEs attempting to develop such a culture. The main findings suggest that Australian SME owners do not provide sufficient support for information security due to insufficient awareness of its importance and may also be affected by national attitudes to risk. The paper concludes that Australian SME owners may benefit from adopting a risk-based approach to information security and should be educated about the potential strategic role of information technology and information security. The paper also identifies the value and difficulty of promoting a behavioural and learning approach to information security to complement traditional technological and managerial approaches.

Single sign-on technology is emerging as a leading technology for password authentication management and promises to improve security while curbing system maintenance costs. While the technology seems to be a simple viable solution for authentication, when placed in context, many socio-technical complexities emerge. One of these complexities is that of the mismatch between the users' mental models and the system model. This study was a 15-month ethnographic field study that followed the implementation of a single sign-on system in a hospital environment. It resulted in the finding that the misaligned mental models caused difficulties not only for the user but for the system administrators. The findings also indicate that not only was the user's mental model of the technology inaccurate, but the presentation of the technology by the information technology group contributed to this misaligned understanding. The end result was dissatisfaction with the new technology for both end users and the system administrators. In order to address the critical issue of mental model misalignment in the implementation of SSO technology, practitioners must first gain an understanding of the preexisting mental models had by the target users regarding authentication and then use this information to guide implementation of the new technology.

In the near future these tags will be used for item level tracking of consumer products such as milk cartons, television sets, and clothing. While this technology brings many benefits to consumers, such as increased convenience and efficiency through automation, it has also caused a lot of concerns about its potentially adverse impact on consumers' personal privacy. Researchers have theorized various threats relating to clandestine tracking and clandestine inventorying of RFIDs. In this paper the authors research practical security threats to consumers in an RFID environment. The authors study various RFID standards and types of RFID tags that are proposed for consumer products. Initial analysis reveals that not all theoretical security threats translate into practical concerns for consumers' privacy. Based on this analysis the authors build a risk model with which consumers can quantify various threats that RFID poses to their information security and privacy. Such evaluation will assist in creating risk-appropriate threat mitigation strategies in consumer REID environments. ©2007 IEEE.","","Identification (control systems); Information services; Paper containers; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Radio navigation; Research; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Security of data; Security systems; Standards; Technology; Information security; Item-level tracking; Personal privacy; Radio-frequency-identification tags; RF-ID tags; RFID security; Risk modeling; Security technologies; Security threats; Threat mitigation; Wal-Mart; Consumer products"

On the three aspects, timestamp precision is the key to keep internal event sequence, time synchronization is the base of correcting event sequence among computers, and that network delay makes time-series analysis not true.

This paper discusses various data management strategies and the strengths and limitations of each approach in providing the user with SA. A new data management strategy, coined Smart Aggregation, is presented as a powerful approach to overcome the challenges of both massive data sets and maintaining SA. By combining automatic data aggregation with user-defined controls on what, how, and when data should be aggregated, we present a visualization system that can handle massive amounts of data while affording the user with the best possible SA. This approach ensures that a system is always usable in terms of both system resources and human perceptual resources.

The particular representation generates a different set of (virtual) bit-planes altogether, suitable for embedding purposes. They not only allow one to embed secret message in higher bit-planes but also do it without much distortion, with a much better stego-image quality, and in a reliable and secured manner, guaranteeing efficient retrieval of secret message. A comparative performance study between the classical Least Significant Bit (LSB) method, the Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique and our proposed schemes has been done. Analysis indicates that image quality of the stego-image hidden by the technique using Fibonacci decomposition improves against that using simple LSB substitution method, while the same using the prime decomposition method improves drastically against that using Fibonacci decomposition technique. Experimental results show that, the stego-image is visually indistinguishable from the original cover-image. © 2007 IEEE.","","Image quality; Bit-planes; cover image; Data-hiding; decomposition methods; Decomposition techniques; Distortion (deformation); Experimental results; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); Least significant bit (LSB); Performance study; Prime numbering; Retrieval (MIR); secret messages; Stego images; Optical devices"

Such a fine-grained authorisation scheme is attractive to service providers offering resources with varying levels of sensitivity and/or wishing to tailor their security protections based upon risk levels. Service providers may wish to restrict access to more sensitive resources only to those who have gone through a more stringent authentication process, or given the same remote entity, require the use of a stronger authentication token should the access request come from a more risky environment.

Nevertheless, pointer taintedness interferes with the specification of several industrial control protocols. As a consequence it is not directly usable in detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in implementations of those industrial control protocols. Furthermore, source-code analysis may have no visibility on certain low-level vulnerabilities since there may be a considerable difference between what programmers intend with the source code they write and what the CPU really executes. A set of memory corruption vulnerabilities specific to implementations of industrial control protocols may escape source code analysis as they are related to a dynamic organization of data in memory. In this paper we define a new concept referred to as memory access taintedness. We discuss the logical motivations behind our definition of memory access taintedness and demonstrate that memory access taintedness is fully employable in vulnerability analysis of the machine code of implementations of industrial control protocols. We analyze the main low-level characteristics of both traditional attacks and attacks specific to process control systems, and demonstrate the ability of memory access taintedness to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities. We represent memory access taintedness as a decision tree and use it as the fundamental component of a finite state machine model we devised for the purpose of dynamically detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in implementations of industrial control protocols. ©2007 IEEE.","Critical infrastructure defense; Industrial control protocols; SCADA systems; Vulnerability analysis","Access control; Arsenic compounds; Codes (standards); Codes (symbols); Control theory; Decision making; Decision theory; Decision trees; Industrial engineering; Military data processing; Production control; Code analysis; Dynamic organization; Finite state machine model; Fundamental components; Industrial controls; Information assurance (IA); Memory accesses; Memory corruption; Memory corruption attacks; Mitigation techniques; New concept; Process control systems; Run time; Source code analysis; Source coding; Vulnerability analysis; Control systems"

Consider the fraction of cyber-attacks due to insiders [1]. The U.S. Secret Service in 1996 estimated 60%, Network World in 2000 estimated 70% to 90% for ""corporate networks"" (and said only 1 in 50 attacks is detected), Deloitte and Touche gave it as 35% in 2004 in a study of the financial industry, a CERT briefing in 2005 gave it as 20%, a Carnegie-Mellon report in 2004 gave it as 39%, and the CSI/FBI annual survey for 2006 estimated that 26% of financial losses anyway came from insiders. Which should we believe? The figures are based on different data collection methods and some are more reliable than others. Most do not adequately identify their sources. To explore this, we have developed a Java data-mining program that collects statements of security-related statistics from the World Wide Web. Besides providing a single source for scattered data, our program permits comparing the sources and influences of statistics [2]. A Web spider first retrieves links (5000 in our experiments) from a Google search of conjunctions of computer-security words such as ""computer + virus + attack"" and ""firewall + intrusion"". Our program then applies filtering not possible with Google. We first delete duplicate pages on different sites and those where the keywords are not in the main body of text (as in links or image references). We search automatically within the page text for specific patterns involving statistical expressions. For instance, we look for numbers followed by ""%"", or ""$"" followed by a number, or phrases like ""one out of four"" or ""one fifth."" Sentences matching on such expressions are then examined for regular expressions such as ""〈integer〉%"", ""〈integer〉.〈integer〉"", and ""〈 integer〉 out of 〈integer〉"". Those sentences that pass all the tests are listed for the user. We use our previously developed software [3] to destem words (remove suffixes) to increase matches. We also ignore sentences containing some ""stop phrases"" representing false positives on uninteresting statistics, like ""the following review helpful"" as used on Amazon.com. About 5% of the initial pages found by Google had relevant sentences. Matched sentences are stored in a table with their address, date of last modification, and date of creation. (For pages without a ""date last modified"" field, we used the last date in the page text.) To trace the history of particular statistics, our program also searched for other occurrences of sentences found and similar sentences. Similarity was measured, following ideas from [2], by the vector inner product of the frequency distributions of words in the sentences (which usually amounts to the fraction of words in common) times an adjustment factor to reward longer sentences. A set of ""stop words"" like ""and"" and ""the"" were excluded from this calculation. The adjustment factor was the sum of the sentence lengths divided by one plus the sum. We found that requiring around 80% of the words be identical worked best in general. But even then there were false positives on a number of sentences involving the financial news unrelated to information security, such as ""One in five sustained financial losses due to an attack on mobile data platforms."" Inspection of our experimental results revealed some exact matches, indicating free use of quotation on the Web, but also there were paraphrases which we could only find by our similarity-matching methods. ©2007 IEEE.","","Computer software; Computer viruses; Estimation; Industrial economics; Information services; Internet; Java programming language; Losses; Mining laws and regulations; Statistical methods; Statistics; Telecommunication; World Wide Web; Corporate networks; Data collection methods; False positive (FP); Financial industry; Financial losses; Financial news; Frequency distributions; Fuzzy scalar (inner) product; Google search; Information assurance (IA); Information security; Keywords (CO); Matching methods; Mobile data; Regular expressions; Retrieval (MIR); Scattered data; Single sourcing; Security of data"

Despite a number of secure algorithms that have been proposed, the trade-offs made between security and performance demands further research toward improvement. In bulk data transfer, especially in large messages, the secured processing time takes much longer than non-secured processes. This is due to crypto operations, which include symmetric encryption operations and hashing functions. In the current bulk data transfer phase in Secure Socket Layer (SSL), the server or the client firstly calculates the Message Authentication Code (MAC) of the data using Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) operation, and then performs the symmetric encryption on the data together with the MAC. This paper proposes a new algorithm which provides a significant performance gain in bulk data transfer without compromising the security. The proposed algorithm performs the encryption of the data and the calculation of the MAC in parallel. The server calculates the MAC of the data at the same time as the encryption process of the data. Once the calculation of the MAC is completed, only then the MAC will be encrypted. The algorithm was simulated in two processors with one processor performing the MAC calculation and the other on encrypting the data, simultaneously. The communication between the two processors was done via Message Passing Interface (MPI). Based on the performance simulations, the new parallel algorithm gained speedup of 1.74 with 85% efficiency over the current (sequential) algorithm. ©2007 IEEE.","Bulk data transfer; Encryption; Hashing; Information security; Parallel crypto operations","Access control; Algorithms; Authentication; Codes (standards); Codes (symbols); Computer privacy; Cryptography; Data transfer; Information services; Message passing; Parallel algorithms; Phase interfaces; Reliability; Security of data; Sequential switching; Telecommunication systems; Video streaming; Bulk data transfer; Computer users; Encryption; Hashing; Hashing functions; Information security; International conferences; Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code; Malaysia; Message authentication code; Message-passing interface; New algorithm; Parallel crypto operations; Performance gains; Performance simulations; Processing Time; Secure-socket-layer; Symmetric encryption; Transfer phase; Two processors; Data processing"

In the role-based access control(RBAC) model, separation of duty constraints enforce conflict of interest policies. There are two main types of separation of duty policies in RBAC, Static SoD (SSoD) and Dynamic SoD (DSoD). In RBAC, Statically Mutually Exclusive Role (SMER) constraints are used to enforce Static Separation of Duty policies. Dynamic Separation of duty policies, like SSoD policies, are intended to limit the permissions that are available to a user. However, DSoD policies differ from SSoD policies by the context in which these limitations are imposed. A DSoD policy limits the availability of the permissions over a users permission space by placing constraints on the roles that can be activated within or across a users sessions. Like SMER, in RBAC Dynamically Mutually Exclusive Role (DMER) constraints are used to enforce DSoD policies. We investigated using of a fuzzy approach to address the issue in order to provide a more practical solution. In this paper, we propose a model to express the separation of duty policies in RBAC using the fuzzy set theory. The concept of trustworthiness, which is fuzzy in nature, is used to express this model. In comparison with non-fuzzy methods, our method is more pragmatic and more consistent with the real world. The expressiveness of our method is higher than the nonfuzzy ones. We show expression of some constraints in our method which cannot be expressed by non-fuzzy methods. Applicability of the method is shown through an example of the real world. © 2007 IEEE.","","Control systems; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Isomers; Ketones; Military data processing; Security of data; Security systems; Separation; Set theory; (R ,s ,S) policy; computer security; Conflict of interest; Dynamic Separation of Duty; Fuzzy approach; Fuzzy methods; Fuzzy relations; Fuzzy set theory (FST); In order; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); Practical solutions; Real world; Role-based access control (RBAC) models; Separation of duties; Statically mutually exclusive role (SMER) constraints; Access control"

We show that our approach scales efficiently, with the communication costs and the number of entries maintained at each node being bounded by the logarithm of the size of the name space. ©2007 IEEE.","","Algebra; Information analysis; Internet; Cache sharing; Communication costs; Cooperative caching; Domain name system (DNS); Information assurance (IA); Misconfigurations; Name resolution; Name spaces; Worst case; Internet protocols"

This investigation is aimed at understanding different design and implementation flaws of models, including, but not limited to, the following: technical, economic, and human aspects. Collectively, these findings will not only highlight the problems in the models, but also lead to a better understanding of the models as a whole. This information can then be used to create a framework for a model that will overcome the flaws of existing models by being practical and robust.

Avionic systems employing an Integrated Modular Architecture (IMA) are currently being deployed on new aircraft such as the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 787. This paper lays out the applicability of the IMA approach to military aircraft such as tankers, bombers, surveillance aircraft and cargo aircraft. The IMA principles can be applied to both new aircraft designs and to existing aircraft that are going through an Aircraft Extension Program (AEP). The modular design of an IMA provides a number of advantages such as cost savings, shorter development time, and higher growth potential. It is scalable to meet the processing needs of the aircraft and is more flexible to implement. An IMA system can offer significant savings in weight, space, power, and cooling required over a comparable federated system. These advantages are particularly important as the Military Services begin to implement civil Communication Navigation and Surveillance for Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Network Centric Warfare concepts such as Real-Time Information in the Cockpit (RTIC) using military data links. The use of open standards in the architecture of the IMA allows third parties to implement both hardware and software modules in the IMA architecture. The General Processing Modules (GPMs) may host multiple software applications using an ARINC 653 standard application partitioning to make best use of the high speed commercial processors available. The use of standard Application Processor Interface (API) software creates an open software architecture that allows third parties to independently provide software applications also referred to as hosted functions which run within the partitioned operating environment on the GPMs. The intra module communication architecture, (between modules in the IMA) is also based on open standards like Ethernet, Personal Computer Interface (PCI) or VERSA Module Europe (VME), which are also freely available, allowing thirdparty, independent development of the IMA cabinet hardware modules. The Remote Interface Units (RIUs) allow systems with other data networking interfaces to communicate with the IMA. RIUs can interface with ARINC 429, CANBUS, analog and discrete inputs and can be configured to meet specific aircraft requirements. RIUs can be extended to support military specific technologies such as MIL STD 1553 devices which are needed to support the special radios and data link equipment used by the military. Major applications that are typically implemented in the IMA architecture are Communication, Navigation and Surveillance for Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Network Centric Warfare. CNS/ATM applications suitable for hosting in an IMA platform include the Flight Management, Communication Management and Terrain and Traffic Advisories applications. In federated systems these applications are implemented as standalone systems in separate Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). Significant cost savings and flexibility can be achieved by using an IMA approach. Network Centric Warfare applications can also benefit from an IMA approach. Military voice and data link radios can be managed using a function hosted in an IMA platform and controlled using Multipurpose Control Display Units (MCDUs), reducing the number of control panels necessary in the cockpit. Processing of the secure datalink messages can also be performed in the IMA, reducing the cost and LRU count on the aircraft. Information Assurance issues such as data security remain an active topic in the industry, but can be addressed using separate data networks for secure and nonsecure data and data encryption for transmission and storage of secure data to deny unauthorized access. ©2007 IEEE.","","Aerospace industry; Air navigation; Air traffic control; Aircraft; Aircraft instruments; Application programming interfaces (API); Architecture; Avionics; Cargo aircraft; Cockpits (aircraft); Computer architecture; Computer hardware; Cryptography; Data storage equipment; Digital arithmetic; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Information management; Interfaces (computer); Military aircraft; Military applications; Military aviation; Military operations; Network architecture; Personal computers; Software architecture; Standardization; Standards; Tankers (ships); Trajectories; Transport aircraft; Air traffic management (ATM); Airbus A380; Aircraft designs; Aircraft requirements; Application partitioning; Application processors; ARINC 653; Avionic systems; Boeing 787; Civil transport aircraft; CNS/ATM; Communication , navigation and surveillance (CNS); Communication architectures; Computing platforms; Control display units; Control panels; Cost savings; Data encryption; Data linking; Data networking; Data networks; Data security; Data-links; Development time; Digital avionics; Federated systems; Flight management; Growth potential; Hardware and software; Hardware modules; High speeds; Information assurance (IA); Integrated modular architecture (IMA); Interface units; Intra-module; Line replaceable units (LRU); MIL-STD-1553; Military services; Military transport aircraft; Modular designs; Network Centric Warfare (NCW); Open Software; Open Standards; Operating environment; Processing capabilities; Processing modules; Processing needs; Real time informations; Secure data; Software applications; Stand-alone systems; Surveillance aircraft; Third parties; Traffic Advisory (TA); Voice and data; Security of data"

Secure platforms have been proposed that protect the secrecy of application algorithms and enforce copy protection assurances. Unfortunately, these capabilities incur a sizeable performance overhead. Partitioning an application into secure and insecure regions can help diminish these overheads but invalidates guarantees of code secrecy and copy protection. This work examines one of the problems of partitioning an application into public and private regions, the ability of an adversary to recreate those private regions. To our knowledge, it is the first to analyze this problem when considering application operation as a whole. Looking at the fundamentals of the issue, we analyze one of the simplest attacks possible, a ""Memoization Attack."" We implement an efficient Memoization Attack and discuss necessary techniques that limit storage and computation consumption. Experimentation reveals that certain classes of real-world applications are vulnerable to Memoization Attacks.

They have been very popular and widely applied for many years now due to the rapid advancements in data and communication wireless technologies. There are many challenges to be overcome in order to put such a heterogeneous system together. Key issues to be considered are network delay, data sensitivity and information security. This paper characterizes a wireless distributed NCS, a testbed called iSpace based on these key factors. We integrated static network security algorithms DES and 3DES with the NCS testbed iSpace - a multidisciplinary network based robot navigation system - and characterized it on the basis of bandwidth requirement, data classification and data sensitivity, network delay effect on the system performance. The paper demonstrates through results that a dynamic optimization is required between network security for reliability and time-sensitivity of the NCS. Future work in dynamic optimization in security is suggested. ©2007 IEEE.","Data security; Data-sensitive wireless network; Distributed networked-control-system; iSpace","Asymptotic analysis; Control systems; Electronics industry; Information services; Internet; Mechatronics; Nanostructured materials; Navigation systems; Network security; Optimization; Real time systems; Sensor networks; Technology; Wireless networks; Bandwidth requirements; Con trol algorithms; Data classification; Data security; Data-sensitive wireless network; Distributed networked-control-system; Dynamic optimization; Future work; Heterogeneous systems; Information security; Integrating sensors; Intelligent mechatronics; International conferences; iSpace; Key factors; Network based; Network delays; Network structures; Real-time applications; Robot navigation systems; Security algorithms; Static networks; System performances; Test beds; Time-sensitivity; Wireless technologies; Security of data"

The frequency of terms in each description relates to the behaviour of the offender and this can be used to link crimes to a common offender. Language Modelling uses Bayes' theorem and thus require a prior probability. Such a prior can be based on each offender's past propensity to offend, derived from historic data. Language Modelling yields a probability of a document being relevant, which in this case is interpreted as the probability of a suspect being the culprit. Although the absolute value of the probability does not carry any direct applied implications, the study does show that the general likelihood of identification of the actual suspect does correspond to the relative values. Thus these probabilities can be used for more than just ranking suspects. © 2007 IEEE.","","Computational linguistics; Diffractive optical elements; Law enforcement; Linguistics; Random processes; Risk assessment; Absolute values; Applied (CO); Bayes' theorem; General (CO); Historic data; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); language modelling; Language models (LM); Probability"

A masquerade attack is a form of attack wherein the attacker uses someone else's identity or one system assumes the identity of another system. One extremely simple and dangerous form of a masquerade attack occurs when an attacker begins using an unattended and unlocked computer. In this paper, we present a new method for detecting this type of masquerade attack, based on the notion of how the current user interacts with the graphical user interface. This method does not use mouse movements or keystroke dynamics, rather profiles how the user manipulates the windows, icons, menus, and pointers that comprise a graphical user interface. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some empirical studies in a real operational environment. While our results show some variations in performance, our method was able to detect up to 95% of simulated masquerade attacks with no false alarms. Furthermore, our method shows potential for use in real-time systems, requiring less data than other GUI interaction-based masquerade detection techniques while using a much simpler classification engine. ©2007 IEEE.","GUI usage; Intrusion detection; Masquerade detection; Profiling","Alarm systems; Computer systems; Graphical user interfaces; Real time systems; Classification engine; Empirical studies; False alarms (FA); Information assurance (IA); Keystroke dynamics; Masquerade attacks; Masquerade detection; Mouse movements; Operational environments; Real-time systems; Usage analysis; Computer crime"

Reverse-engineers search for security holes in the program to exploit or try to steal competitors' vital algorithms. To discourage reverse-engineering, developers use a variety of static software protections to obfuscate their programs. Metamorphic software protections add another layer of protection to traditional static obfuscation techniques, forcing reverse-engineers to adjust their attacks as the protection changes. Program fragmentation combines two obfuscation techniques, outlining and obfuscated jump tables, into a new, metamorphic protection. Sections of code are removed from the main program flow and placed throughout memory, reducing the program's locality. These fragments move and are called using obfuscated jump tables, making program execution difficult to follow. This research assesses the performance overhead of a program fragmentation engine and provides analysis of its effectiveness against reverse-engineering techniques. Results show that program fragmentation has low overhead and is an effective technique to complicate disassembly of programs using two common disassembler/debugger tools.","","Competition; Engineering; Engineering research; Engineering techniques; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); Low overhead; program executions; program flow; security holes; Software industry; Software protection; Electric breakdown"

There are many defensive options available to these policies, but current mechanically-enforced security policies are limited to traditional admission-based access control. There are defensive capabilities available that include logging, firewalls, honeypots, rollback/recovery, and intrusion detection systems, but policy enforcement is essentially limited to allow/deny semantics. Furthermore, access-control mechanisms operate independently on each service, which often leads to inconsistent or incorrect application of the intended system-wide policy. To begin to solve these problems, we propose a new system for defense-in-depth using global security policies. Under a global security policy, every policy decision is made with near-global knowledge, and re-evaluated as global knowledge changes, given an initial configuration provided by the administrator. Using a variety of actuators, we make the full array of defensive capabilities available to the global policy.

How do we ensure that identity theft occurrences are reduced, and people can enjoy the benefits of managing multiple accounts online? There are numerous schemes and systems that exist today, but many are difficult to implement, especially for the end users. When analyzing a system from a technical standpoint, one might be able to set the security policies and password encryption strength to the appropriate level in order to protect the information it contains, however, when multiple users utilize this system, and they in turn use other systems with identical passwords, the initial system can become less secure. In addition, phishing attacks are becoming more popular, where users may enter the password they reuse on a hostile site, which could result in compromising multiple systems. This paper examines various authentication methods and mechanisms available today, and determines which is appropriate for various uses. In general, users and administrators are responsible for security, and they should treat their systems with regard to the sensitivity of what they want to protect. Users should always consider the importance of each system they use and choose an authentication method or password scheme to match the system they intend to operate.

We also present some of performance envelopes of both architectures. ©2007 IEEE.","","Data analysis; Data sourcing; Honeynet; Honeywall (CO); Information assurance (IA); Modular architectures; Packet processing; Wide-range; Statistical methods"

To demonstrate the feasibility of operating system-level support for temporal access controls, the Time Interval File Protection System (TIFPS), a prototype of the Time Interval Access Control (TIAC) model, has been implemented by modifying Linux extended attributes to include temporal metadata associated both with files and users. The Linux Security Module was used to provide hooks for temporal access control logic. In addition, a set of utilities was modified to be TIFPS-aware. These tools permit users to view and manage the temporal attributes associated with their files and directories. Functional, performance, and concurrency testing were conducted. The ability of TIFPS to grant or revoke access in the future, as well to limit access to specific time intervals enhances traditional information control and sharing. ©2007 IEEE.","","Computer operating systems; Metadata; Security systems; Temporal logic; Access control logic; Access to information; Information assurance (IA); Information control; Operating systems; Protection systems; Security modules; Specific time; Temporal attributes; Time intervals; Access control"

The long-standing technical barrier to the acceptance of this system call monitoring approach is how to derive accurate sandboxing policies for Windows applications whose source code is unavailable. In fact, many commercial computer security companies take advantage of this fact and fashion a business model in which their users have to pay a subscription fee to receive periodic updates on the application sandboxing policies, much like anti-virus signatures. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a sandboxing system called BASS1 that can automatically extract a highly accurate application-specific sandboxing policy from a Win32/X86 binary, and enforce the extracted policy at run time with low performance overhead. BASS is built on a binary interpretation and analysis infrastructure called BIRD, which can handle application binaries with dynamically linked libraries, exception handlers and multi-threading, and has been shown to work correctly for a large number of commercially distributed Windows-based network applications, including IIS and Apache. The throughput and latency penalty of BASS for all the applications we have tested except one is under 8%. © 2007 IEEE.","","Concurrency control; Industry; Security of data; Security systems; (R ,s ,S) policy; Anti-virus (AV); Application-Specific; Buffer overflows; Business model (BM); computer security; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); Network applications; Software vulnerabilities; Source coding; System call monitoring; System calls; Computer viruses"

We also compared different approaches to combining clues to spam such as Bayesian reasoning, case-based reasoning, and neural networks; Bayesian reasoning performed the best. Our conclusion is that Bayesian reasoning on word clues is sufficient for antispam software and that blacklists and whitelists are unnecessary. ©2007 IEEE.","Clues; Phishing; Spam; Testing; Words","Artificial intelligence; Case based reasoning; Electronic mail; Internet; Neural networks; Spamming; Anti spam; Automated detection; Bayesian reasoning; Case Based Reasoning (CBR); Information assurance (IA); Phishing; Time of day; Bayesian networks"

Based on these, we first propose a novel data mining scheme for network anomaly detection in this paper. Moreover, we adopt data reduction mechanisms (including genetic algorithm (GA) based instance selection and filter based feature selection methods) to boost the detection performance, meanwhile reduce the computational cost of TCM-KNN.

These location based services (LBS) all require a location declaration by the user (or his electronic device). A typical example is a web query for services within an area in which the user is interested. Since the user cannot control the use of the data included in his query once it leaves the device or the response, he must assume that information is available to an unknown observer, thereby creating the potential for the user's location privacy to be compromised. This paper introduces the concept of a location privacy threshold which has two components: distance from the true location and probability that an observer would select the user's true location from a set of bogus locations. To preserve the user's location privacy, his location can be cloaked by adding additional web queries for the same information in areas near his designated location. A minimum spanning tree algorithm is used to identify clusters of potential user locations and determine whether the queries and replies provide enough uncertainty in the user's location to meet his predetermined privacy threshold. ©2007 IEEE.","Location privacy; Privacy threshold; Wireless devices","Canning; Helium; Internet; Mobile computing; Trees (mathematics); Web services; World Wide Web; Content based; Electronic devices; Information assurance (IA); Location Based Services (LBS); Location privacy; Minimum spanning tree (MST); Observer (OBS); On-line services; User location; Web querying; Location"

One of the lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan was the need for a more robust Beyond-Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communication capability between the lower Army echelon Land Warriors, Squad Leaders, Platoon Leaders, Company Commanders and the Battalion Commanders. These lower echelon units currently rely on radios that are propagation range constrained to the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) distance between the radios. The tactical communications radios that currently service the lower echelon Army units currently are dominated by Combat Network Radios (CNRs) that are dominated by the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) and the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS). The BLOS communications capability of the SNE combined with its ability to communicate OTM will help to close the communication gap existing between the various tactical legacy radio networks. This shortfall was identified by a TRADOC study, and need for a low cost Single Integrated Transport System (SITS) was suggested. The basic requirements for providing this lower echelon communications solution include: Interface compatibility requirements with future networking systems Potential for interoperability with higher echelons Baseband compatibility requirements with existing digitized lower echelon units Information Assurance (IA)/Encryption Requirements At-The-Halt (ATH)/On-The-Move (OTM) Capabilities These requirements formed that basis of the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) Soldier Network Extension (SNE) program. ©2007 IEEE.","","BASIC (programming language); Communication; Cryptography; Health; Information services; Military communications; Network architecture; Radio communication; Satellite communication systems; Tanks (military); Telecommunication systems; Afghanistan; Airborne radio system; Army units; Baseband (BB); Communication architectures; Communication capabilities; Communication gaps; Communications capability; Enhanced position location reporting system (EPLRS); Information assurance (IA); Integrated transport; Interface compatibility; Lessons learned (LL); Line-of sight (LOS); Low costs; Network extensions; Networked services; Networking systems; Radio networks; Satellite communications (SATCOM); Single channel (SC); Tactical Communications; War fighter; Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN T); Military operations"

SOA provides patterns for the architecture, design, implementation, deployment, and management of loosely coupled software services that support the requirements of business processes and software users regardless of the underlying platform or implementation. The focus of this paper will be to examine providing a SOA via Web services. More specifically, this paper will discuss an architecture for developing Web services that perform closed-loop diagnostics in military NCSEs. The military information technology infrastructure is comprised of many diverse systems that together provide to key personnel the processed information necessary to support our war-fighters. When new or upgraded systems are deployed, it is far too costly to rewrite all legacy applications. A more cost effective method is to take a System-of-Systems approach to provide a non-intrusive solution that blends well with existing support processes and leverages existing applications and their data stores. A SOA readily supports implementing a System-of-Systems solution to provide closed-loop diagnostics in NCSEs in which various components reside at multiple levels and within multiple domains. When utilizing a SOA to implement closed-loop diagnostics in NCSEs, there are several key ingredients in developing a suitable architecture. These ingredients include leveraging the architecture defined in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) STD 1232 - Artificial Intelligence Exchange and Service Tie to All Test Environments (AI-ESTATE) specification, leveraging standard data format specifications such as the IEEE STD P1636.1 Draft Trial-Use Standard for Software Interface for Maintenance Information Collection and Analysis (SIMICA): Exchanging Test Results and Session Information via the Extensible Markup Language (XML) specification, leveraging the XML transaction communication framework, ensuring information assurance compliance, and ensuring 24/7 system availability.","","Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Computer software maintenance; Cost effectiveness; Hypertext systems; Information management; Information services; Legacy systems; Maintainability; Maintenance; Markup languages; Query languages; Regulatory compliance; Software design; Specifications; Standards; Testing; Web services; World Wide Web; XML; Business processes; Closed loops; Communication framework; Data formatting; Extensible markup language; Information assurance; Information technology infrastructure; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; Integrated diagnostics; Latest technology; Legacy applications; Maintenance information; Multiple domains; Multiple levels; Network-centric; Non-intrusive; Processed information; Service-Oriented Architecture; Software interfacing; Software services; System availability; System-of-systems; Test results; Upgraded systems; Technology"

In addition, the need to prepare countermeasures against the possibility of quality deterioration due to the application of security measures has frequently been pointed out. However, it is difficult to use the existing methodologies to perform a threat and vulnerability analysis that enables the application of the security technology without sacrificing quality (when applied at the planning stage for a new IT service), as these methodologies are only suitable for the information assets of an organization that has already been established. This paper proposes an information security framework capable of identifying security threats at the new IT service planning stage, and of easily identifying the relevance between the security technologies and QoS, so that the security technology can be applied while maintaining the quality of the service. © 2007 IEEE.","","Information services; Information technology; Internet telephony; Knowledge based systems; Stages; Technology; Telephone systems; Government IS; Information assets; Information security; International conferences; IT services; Quality deterioration; Security measures; Security technologies; Security threats; Service information; Service planning; Service provider; Vulnerability analysis; Quality of service"

Currently, most installations process their own common-user information technology services. As part of a move towards net-centric operations, the Army is looking to consolidate servers and applications at a few data centers known as Area Processing Centers (APCs). The benefits will include improved Warfighters' operational efficiency, reduced Total Cost of Ownership, and enhanced information security posture of the Army enterprise. To move forward, the Army must determine the optimal number and locations of its APCs as well as optimal dualhoming arrangements for all installations. Due to lack of reliable prediction of the impact to the backbone capacity and application latency, we try to solve a surrogate problem based on notions of equity in demand load and distance traveled between clients and servers. The suggested location and homing solutions may not be optimal in terms of future capacity usage and user experience, but the approach provides a quick and practical method to make location recommendations. An optimization model was developed to recommend APC locations and installation homing arrangements such that the total demand-weighted distance traveled is minimized and the load on any APC can be as small as possible. This paper presents an integer programming model for the problem and demonstrates how to use the model in a practical, iterative process to make facility location and demand homing decisions for any general setting. © 2007 IEEE.","","Arsenic compounds; Chemical plants; Data processing; Facilities; Information services; Installation; Integer programming; Location; Mathematical programming; Military communications; Optimization; Population statistics; Satellite communication systems; Backbone capacity; Continental (CO); Data center (DC); Diverse range; Facility locations; Information security; Integer programming models; Iterative processing; Net Centric Operations (NCO); Operational efficiencies; Optimal number; Optimization modeling; Practical methods; Problem based; Total cost of ownership (TCO); User experience; User information; Warfighters; Weighted distance; Military operations"

The increased deployment of secure networks has resulted in an evolution of secure network architectures and the Information Assurance methods and tools used to protect them. Specifically, new technological advances in the ability to monitor and protect fiber optic cables and connections possess huge potential for cost savings and enhanced protection of critical networks and C4ISR facilities. With the accelerated development and deployment of C4ISR applications on the Global Information Grid, warfighters are developing a strategic dependence upon the availability and integrity of secure networks. While encryption has been used for decades to protect the confidentiality and non-repudiation of national security information (NSI), encryption alone provides no coverage or protection against threats to network availability and integrity. Through recent developments in intrinsic fiber monitoring technology, critical connections can now be proactively monitored to detect any threats or physical attacks on the network WITHOUT degrading network performance or restricting network bandwidth. Using the principles of the Defense in Depth strategy, intrinsic fiber monitoring provides a very agile and scalable protection methodology that can be used by itself or in combination with cryptographic equipment to provide the required protection of classified networks and the ability to withstand the ever-increasing threats to the networks.","","Computer architecture; Cryptography; Electric breakdown; Fiber optic networks; Fiber optics; Fibers; Military communications; Military operations; Reliability; Systems engineering; Telecommunication; Telecommunication cables; Ubiquitous computing; Connections (structural); Cost savings; Critical connections; Defense in depth strategy; Department of Defense (DOD); Evolution (CO); Fiber-optic cables; Global information grid (GIG); Information assurance (IA); Monitor (CO); Monitoring technologies; National securities; Network availability; Network bandwidths; Network connectivity; Network performances; Non-repudiation; Physical attacks; Scalable protection; Secure networks; Technological advances; Warfighters; Network architecture"

As though Systems connected to network have become more complex and wide, unfortunately, the researches for the systems are focused on the 'performance' or 'efficiency'.

Detecting such events automatically is very difficult because web pages are highly dynamic and their degree of dynamism may vary widely across different pages. In this paper we propose a novel detection approach based on Genetic Programming (GP), an established evolutionary computation paradigm for automatic generation of algorithms. What makes GP particularly attractive in this context is that it does not rely on any domain-specific knowledge, whose description and synthesis is invariably a hard job. In a preliminary learning phase, GP builds an algorithm based on a sequence of readings of the remote page to be monitored and on a sample set of attacks. Then, we monitor the remote page at regular intervals and apply that algorithm, which raises an alert when a suspect modification is found. We developed a prototype based on a broader web detection framework we proposed earlier and we tested our approach over a dataset of 15 dynamic web pages, observed for about a month, and a collection of real web defacements. We compared the results to those of a solution we developed earlier, whose design embedded a substantial amount of domain specific knowledge, and the results clearly show that GP may be an effective approach for this job. © 2007 IEEE.","","Automatic programming; Boolean functions; Computer graphics; Computer programming; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Learning algorithms; World Wide Web; (e ,3e) process; automatic generation; Data sets; detection approach; detection framework; Domain-specific knowledge; Dynamic web pages; Evolutionary computation (EC); Genetic programming (GP); Information Assurance and Security (IAS); learning phase; Monitor (CO); Sample sets; Synthesis (of chiral ionic liquids); web pages; Web site; Websites"

Risk accumulates at components/nodes (hosts, servers, databases, etc.) due to risk shocks hitting them (virus, worm attacks, etc.) and is monitored by risk indicators. The risk manager dynamically chooses defenses by reconfiguring and allocating available protection resources to various infrastructure components/nodes. The issue is to dynamically control risk by (re)deploying defenses on the spot in response to changing risk indicators. The framework is designed to parallel queuing modeling ones, mapping backlog/congestion to risk level/stress. This exposes interesting connections between dynamic risk management and queueing systems. It also allows for leveraging some results of congestion management for risk mitigation, as well as developing new ones to capture risk management performance tradeoffs. © 2007 IEEE.","","Finance; Insurance; Ketones; Management; Pesticide effects; Risk analysis; Risk management; Traffic congestion; Computing infrastructures; congestion management; Connections (structural); Information Assurance and Security (IAS); Queueing systems; risk indicators; risk management performance; risk managers; risk mitigation; Security risks; Risks"

A more challenging problem is to hide data in a two - color binary image. Hiding is difficult for the binary image since each of its black or white pixels requires only one bit representation. So that, changing a pixel can be easily detected. In this paper, we propose a new data hiding scheme using the parity of blocks. The original image is partitioned into m x n blocks. The new scheme ensures that for any bit that is modified in the host image, the bit must be adjacent to another bit that has the same value as the former's new value. Thus, the existence of secret information in the host image is difficult to detect. The invisible effect will be achieved by sacrificing some data hiding space, but the new scheme still offers a good data hiding ratio. Specifically, for each mxn block of host image, we will hide one bit of secret data by changing either one bit or without changing any bits in the block. © 2007 IEEE.","","Binary images; Customer satisfaction; Problem solving; Quality assurance; Quality function deployment; Security of data; Total quality management; Challenging problem; Data-hiding; Good data; Host images; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); original images; Secret data; Secret informations; Two-color; Pixels"

A new set of published parameters will be chosen when a group of data to be encrypted each time. The linear time quick algorithms for deciding the solution structure and computing the solution of the quartic congruential equations are proposed for implementing the operations on the published parameters. This cryptosystem can actively protect against the chosen plaintext and the various chosen ciphertext attacks including IND-CCA2 attacks. It achieves the same security like One-Time-Pad. For the repeated encryption/decryption for a set of data the requirements for computation and memory size are deeply decreased because only a series of XOR operations are needed after first data item has been encrypted/decrypted.

Psyco-Virt architecture includes a cluster of virtual machines, the monitored VMs, which run the OS and applications of interest, and a further VM, the introspection one. Several agents distributed across the monitored VMs execute network and host IDS tools to discover attempted intrusions/attacks on the monitored VMs. The introspection VM makes the detection tools trustworthy by running an introspector and a director to discover any attempt to maliciously modify the kernel, the agents and the IDSes hosted on a monitored VM. On each monitored VM a collector gathers the alerts generated by the agents and forwards them to the director through a control network dedicated to data exchange among the agents and the introspection VM. The director on the introspection VM filters all the alerts and delegates the execution of a proper action to a notifier whenever an intrusion or an attempt to modify the IDSes is detected. In such cases, a monitored VM can either be stopped or frozen and its current state saved in a file for a later, deeper inspection.

The modification removes the constraints before the first substitution and after the last substitution. The advantage of the new method over the use of the unconstrained edit distance in the same procedure lies in the possibility of eliminating the need for finer exhaustive search in the fragments of the search space, in which the detected subsequence is too distorted.

To facilitate file sharing and key management, group is adopted. In our system, almost all computationally expensive cryptographic operations are through FPGA/ASIC hardware module.

More specifically, four filtering techniques available for a Naïve Bayesian filter are evaluated. We look at the effectiveness of the technique, and we evaluate different threshold values in order to find an optimal anti-spam filter configuration.

These recommendations are derived by virtue of collaborative filtering. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a method to perform Automated Recommendations based upon the assumption that users who had similar interests in past, will have similar interests in future too. Storing user personal information at such servers has given rise to a number of privacy concerns[13] which are effecting business of these services[15]. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for privacy preserving collaborative Filtering for these services. The proposed architecture attempts to restore user trust in these services by introducing the notion of 'Distributed Trust'. This essentially mean that instead of trusting a single server, a coalition of servers is trusted. Distributions of trust makes the proposed architecture fault resilient and robust against security attacks. Moreover, the architecture employs an efficient crossing minimization based biclustering algorithm for collaborative filtering. This algorithm is easily amenable to privacy preserving implementation. The privacy preserving implementation makes use of a threshold homomorphic cryptosystem. The proposed algorithm is fully implemented and evaluated with encouraging results. © 2007 IEEE.","Biclustering; Collaborative filtering; Crossing minimization; Privacy enhancing technologies; Threshold homomorphic cryptosystems","Architecture; Boolean functions; Canning; Cryptography; Data privacy; Electronic commerce; Filtration; Internet; Servers; biclustering algorithms; Collaborative Filtering (CF); crossing minimization; crypto systems; E-commerce; Fault resilient; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); Novel architecture; personal information; privacy concerns; Privacy preserving; Security attacks; Similar Interests; Single servers; web portals; Signal filtering and prediction"

The array of schemes proposed for detection of these attacks in real time is either targeted towards low rate attacks or high bandwidth attacks. Presence of low rate attacks leads to graceful degradation of QoS in the network thus making them further undetectable. In this paper, we propose a scheme that uses three lines of defense. The first line of defense is towards detecting the presence of low rate as well as high bandwidth attacks based on entropy variations in small time windows. The second line of defense identifies and tags attack flows in real time. The last line of defense is redirecting the attack flows to honeypot server that responds in contained manner to the attack flows, thus providing deterrence and maintaining QoS at ISP level.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologcies, various approaches have been successfully applied to the biometric identification, like the neural network, fuzzy logic, principal component analysis, independent component analysis and wavelet transform (ID and 2D). A typical fingerprint image usually appears as an arbitrary picture with a unique pattern whose reoccurring data are reflected within each individual print. The 2D discrete wavelet transform can be used to digitally compress fingerprints and reconstruct original images via components of the approximation, horizontal detail, vertical detail and diagonal detail from the input image transformation. At the same time, some quantitative measures are needed in order to evaluate the quality of the wavelet transform. In this research, several measures are proposed to evaluate information flow of the 2D discrete wavelet transform.

These schemes strongly bind to authorization entity set functions and authorization entity relation functions, so they can provide the system designers a clear view about which functions should be defined in an authorization constraint system. Based on these functions, different kinds of constraint schemes can be easily defined. The security administrators can use these functions to create constraint schemes for their day-to-day operations. The constraint system can be scalable through defining new functions.

Our approach is based on novel modifications and improvements of a few recent techniques in this area: (1) the scale adapted Harris detector, which is an extension to multi-scale domains of the Harris corner detector; (2) automatic scale selection by the characteristic scale of a local structure. (3) SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), one of the most widely investigated descriptors in recent years. Like most of other local feature representations, the proposed approach can also be divided into two stages: (i) a set of distinctive local features are selected by first detecting scale adaptive Harris corners where each of them is associated with a scale factor, and then selecting as the final result only those corners whose scale matches the scale of blob-like structures around them. Here, the scale of a blob-like structure is detected by the Laplace-based scale selection. (ii). for each feature detected, an enhanced SIFT descriptor is computed to represent this feature. Our improvements lead two novel methods which we call the Modified Harris-Laplace (MHL) detector, and the enhanced SIFT descriptor. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme to the shoeprint image retrieval problem using six sets of synthetic scene images, 50 images for each, and a database of 500 reference shoeprint images.

One of the key components of this effort is the Information Security, Services, and Systems Promoting Awareness, Communication, and Education (iS3PACE) information security collaborative. Several key operating units contribute to the collaborative to ensure the delivery of consistent, coordinated information security directives, guidelines, and practices. iS3PACE started with building awareness by engaging administrators, staff, and students through various print and formal media. Contests, on-campus symposiums, poster displays, distributing security tips, and an award-winning calendar served to raise security awareness. Formal training began with the delivery of ISO standard Information Security training to students, staff, and faculty.

Network performance is evaluated in terms of normalized throughput, routing overhead, normalized routing load, and average packet delay, when a percentage of nodes misbehave. Simulation results show that although the performance of all three routing protocols degrades, DSDV is the most robust routing protocol under security attacks.

The authentication codes consist of inter-block and intra-block codes in order to detect and localize tampering. The semi-fragile fingerprinting algorithm is intended to embed the signature via the use of block-mean quantization.

However, due to the large number of users in nowadays online services of organizations and enterprises, assigning users to roles is a tiresome task and maintaining user-role assignment up- to-date is costly and error-prone. Additionally, with the increasing number of users, RBAC may have problems in prohibiting cheat and changing roles of users. In order to categorize information and formulate security policies, human decision making is required which is naturally fuzzy in the real world. This leads using a fuzzy approach to address the issue in order to provide a more practical solution. In this paper, applicability of fuzzy set theory to RBAC has been investigated by identifying access control building blocks which are fuzzy in essence. An existing RBAC model is extended to allow imprecise access control policies, using the concept of trustworthiness which is fuzzy in nature. We call the extended model as Fuzzy RBAC.

In this paper, we propose a method that considers the traffic in a network as a time-series and smoothens it using exponential moving average and analyzes the smoothened wave using energy distribution based on wavelet analysis. The parameters we used to represent the traffic are number of bytes received per unit time and the proportion between incoming and outgoing bytes. By analyzing the energy distribution in the wavelet form of a smoothened time-series, growth in the traffic, which is the result of a DoS attack can be detected very early. As the parameters we considered represent different properties of the network, the accuracy of the detection will be very high and with less false positives. © 2007 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Digital signal processing; DOS; Electric power distribution; Ion beams; Ubiquitous computing; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; (PL) properties; Denial of service (DoS) attacks; DOS attacks; Energy distributions; False positive (FP); Information Assurance and Security (IAS); Moving-average (MA); Time Series; Time series analysis"

To send aggregated data, it is also helpful to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted and thereby conserve energy. Indeed current in-network aggregation schemes are helpful to conserve energy but they are designed without considering possible security issues related to data privacy. Often we find wireless sensor networks designed with neighbouring nodes sharing keys or with decryption at aggregator nodes. In either situation the potential for aggregator nodes to be physically compromised means data privacy is at high risk. Therefore secure data aggregation is desirable where data can be aggregated without the need for decryption at aggregator nodes. Aggregation becomes especially challenging if end-to-end privacy between a source and a destination (sink or group leader) is required.

To overcome this problem with a moderate communication overhead, this paper introduces a new approach for detecting misbehaving nodes that drop data packets in MANET. It consists of two stages the monitoring stage in which each node monitors its direct neighbours with respect to forwarding data packets of a traffic session in the network, and the decision stage, in which direct neighbouring nodes decide whether the monitored node misbehave or not. Our new approach is able to detect the misbehaviour in case of power control employment, with a low communication overhead compared to the existing approaches. © 2007 IEEE.","","Access control; Beamforming; Communication; Power control; Stages; Wireless telecommunication systems; Communication overheads; control techniques; Data packets; Drop data; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); Low costs; Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET); Neighbouring nodes; new approaches; Selfish nodes; Two stages; Ad hoc networks"

Considering fingerprint patterns, Gaussian distributions have been previously used for minutiae location and von-Mises distributions for minutiae orientation so as to determine the probability of random correspondence (PRC) between two fingerprints. Motivated by the fact that ridges have not been modeled in generative models, and using representative ridge points in fingerprint matching, ridge information is incorporated into the generative model by using a third distribution for ridge types. The joint probability of minutiae location, minutiae orientation and ridge type is modeled as a mixture distribution. The proposed model offers a more accurate fingerprint representation from which more reliable PRCs can be computed. Based on parameters estimated from fingerprint databases, PRCs using ridge types are seen to be much smaller than PRCs computed with only minutiae. © 2007 IEEE.","","Database systems; Gaussian distribution; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Parameter estimation; Probability; Random processes; (1 1 1) orientation; Fingerprint databases; Fingerprint individuality; fingerprint matching; fingerprint patterns; Fingerprint representation; gaussian; Generative modeling; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); joint probability; Learning parameters; mixture distributions; Quantitative features; Random patterns; Probability distributions"

In recent years, NERCs cybersecurity standard was initiated to require utilities compliance on cybersecurity in control systems - NERC CIP 1200. This standard identifies several cyber-related vulnerabilities that exist in control systems and recommends several remedial actions (e.g., best practices).

They have an important impact on our life. In recent years, due to the advent of high-performance consumer hardware and improved human computer interfaces, it has become relatively easy to create fake images. Typically, to create high quality and consistent forgeries, several types of tampering techniques are employed simultaneously. One of the most often used techniques is resampling (especially when two or more images are spliced together). Generally, resampling is based on an interpolation procedure. Typically, this procedure brings into the signal specific statistical changes. In this work we analyze and analytically describe specific periodic properties presence in interpolated signals and their derivatives. Furthermore, we propose an efficient and blind method to automatically detect the traces of geometric transformations in images and their portions.

Although much work has been done on detection and prevention of control-hijacking attacks, most of them did not address the problem of repairing the attacked network services so as to prevent the same attacks from recurring. Ideally, post-attack repair should consist of an attack signature generation component that creates a filtering rule for front-end firewall or intrusion prevention system to block the detected attack and its variants, and a patch generation component that creates a fix to permanently eliminate the vulnerabilities that the detected attack exploits. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a program transformation and execution trace analysis system called PASAN that can automatically instrument the source code of network service programs in such a way that it can detect control-hijacking attacks and automatically generate patches to seal the vulnerability being exploited by the detected attack. We have implemented the first PASAN prototype as a GNU C compiler extension that aims at stackbased buffer overflow attacks but could be easily generalized to accommodate other control-hijacking attacks. Testing this prototype with seven network daemon programs with known vulnerabilities show that the automatically generated patches can successfully fix the vulnerability. In addition, these patches are similar in their structure to those that are manually created. The run-time performance overhead of application programs instrumented by PASAN is between 10% and 23%, except two programs, whose CPU consumption is low. © 2007 IEEE.","","Buffer storage; Computer software; Control system analysis; Filtration; Maintenance; Military data processing; Repair; Security of data; Technical presentations; Trace analysis; Weight control; analysis system; Application programs; attack signature; Automatically generated; Buffer overflow attacks; execution traces; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); Intrusion Prevention System (IPS); Network services; Network Services (CO); Program transformations; Run time; Source coding; Concurrency control"

However, threat trend is not directly revealed from the time-series data because the trend is implicit in its nature. Besides, traditional time-series analysis, which predicts the future trend pattern by relying exclusively on the past trend pattern, is not appropriate for predicting a trend pattern in dynamic network environments (e.g., the Internet).

In forensics, it is a helpful tool in finding hidden or recently removed disk content. Known signatures in file headers and footers are especially useful in carving such files out, that is, from header until footer. However, this approach assumes that file clusters remain in order. In case of file fragmentation, file clusters can be disconnected and the order can even be disrupted such that straighforward carving will fail. In this paper, we focus on methods for classifying clusters into file types by using the statistics of the clusters. By not exploiting the possible embedded signatures, we generate evidence from a different source that can be integrated lateron. We propose a set of characteristic features and use statistical pattern recognition to learn a supervised classification model for a range of relevant file types. We exploit the statistics of a restricted number of neighboring clusters (context) to improve classification performance. In the experiments we show that the proposed features indeed enable the differentation of clusters into file types. Moreover, for some file types the incorporation of cluster context improves the recognition performance significantly. © 2007 IEEE.","","Classification (of information); Cold heading; Disks (structural components); Feature extraction; Pattern recognition; Statistical methods; (e ,3e) process; classification performance; Embedded signatures; File carving; file systems; In order; Information Assurance and Security (IAS); On methods; Recognition performance; Statistical pattern recognition; Supervised classification; Statistics"

Coupled with the ensuing Bali bombings in Indonesia a year latter and the bombings in the United Kingdom in 2005 a key message is that despite Australia's relative isolation from the rest of the world, it is vulnerable in terms of its critical infrastructure. Because all details about this critical infrastructure are stored in geospatial information systems found in both the public (Federal, State & Local) and the private sector, it is imperative that some form of information security is applied to protect these assets.

Most previous multi-secret sharing schemes have problems in efficiently detecting the cheating of either the dealer or shadowholders and in carrying out complex and large-amount computation for secret recovery. The authors have designed an efficient multi-secret sharing scheme with a generalized access structure on the basis of dealing with the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm modulo for a composite number and the factorization problem of a large integer. The proposed scheme has the following properties: (1) Cheating of the dealer or any participant can be detected efficiently; (2) A new secret can be added on the bulletin by the dealer at any time on condition that small-amount of data are made public; (3) The participants can reconstruct a secret with the parallel procedure in a secret recovery phase; (4) The shadows of the participants will not change when the system accepts a new participant or fires an old participant. This scheme will find wide applications in conferences distributed secretly, securely-distributed computation and electronic commerce.","Access structure; Discrete logarithm; Factorization problem; Secret sharing","Calculations; Computer networks; Cryptography; Electronic commerce; Factorization; Access structure; Communication keys; Computation; Discrete logarithm; Factorization problem; Information security; Secret sharing; Security of data"

There are many image scrambling algorithms. Image scrambling algorithm based on queue transformation is a good method. But it has many disadvantages. So a new image scrambling algorithm based on queue transformation is proposed in this paper. This algorithm only needs one step instead of two steps to complete the scrambling. Meanwhile, reference point can change in every stage. If the attackers want to decode the hiding image, the step, the reference point and the direction should all been known.

Role-based access control is a famous access control approach with good flexibility and expandability. The classical RBAC models are RBAC96 and ARBAC97. The ARBAC97 model is an administrative model with the idea of using RBAC to administrate RBAC. It facilitates decentralized administration of RBAC through three assignment models: URA97, PRA97 and RRA97. Though ARBAC97 works well in traditional RBAC applications, it has some shortcomings if employed in a large organization composed of many autonomous subsidiaries. The member of an administrative role can operate directly in the role range of a junior administrative role, which violates the autonomy of subsidiaries. The authorization relationship is rather complex, and the names of the roles have to be globally unique. A new administrative model named N-RBAC is proposed to overcome these weaknesses. In N-RBAC, all resources (including users and roles) are arranged into a hierarchical namespace structure. Thus the role hierarchy is constructed in a local space instead of in a global space. The administrative role hierarchy is obsolete, and a unique administrative role is assigned to each namespace instead. Experimental results show that the N-RBAC model is more suitable to autonomous distributed role administration than the ARBAC97 model.","ARBAC97; N-RBAC; Namespace; RBAC; RBAC96","Authentication; Network security; Security of data; Hierarchical namespace; Role based access control; Access control"

In 1965, D. David Bourland, Jr. proposed E-Prime as an addition to Korzybski's General Semantics. Bourland defined E-Prime as that proper subset of the English language that omits any forms of the verb ""to be."" E-Prime seems desirable because two forms of the verb ""to be"" have structural problems with security implications that the use of E-Prime would eliminate. I first examine the rationale for E-Prime (reviewing the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and the relevant parts of General Semantics), and then cover the basics of E-Prime. Next I examine the use of E-Prime with several ""before and after"" examples in the areas of user-centered security (Microsoft and ZoneAlarm software messages), organizational/enterprise security policy, and informal security policy modeling (including some examples from the U.S. Computer Security Act and the Clark-Wilson model); these examples show how EPrime can make great improvements in eliminating bad structure and how its use can lead to an overall improvement in security. I then present some of the discussion that occurred at the New Security Paradigms Workshop. I conclude with some thoughts for other areas of promising future research, including roles and responsibilities, program management, risk management, planning and the security life cycle, assurance, disaster planning, incident handling, user awareness and training, support and operations, spam detection, security engineering, and automated E-Prime tools.

A new model of network security analysis based on the increase in attack ability is proposed. It takes into account the network environment and simulates the attacker's behavior, and considers improving the attack ability as attacker's ultimate target to generate attack graph. The method used to represent attack graph make the attack target more clear, because it uses the attack ability's increment to describe a goal, which is more accurate than the attack ability itself. The minimum attack cost analysis considers the influence of similar attacks to compute the cost of each path for the first time, which conforms to the actual process of attack execution. The minimum environment change analysis can help people find out which attack path is most likely to be adopted by the attacker, which deals with IDS in a more reasonable way. These two analysis methods are helpful for improving the network configuration. The algorithm of attack graph generation and the method to analyze the attack graph proposed by the network security analysis model is more feasible than the existing ones.","Attack ability; Attack graph; Attack model; Network security; Network security analysis","Intrusion detection; Mathematical models; Security of data; Attack ability; Attack graph; Attack model; Network security analysis; Network security"

Since the timestamp is used in the keystream generator, the algorithm achieves the robustness against the adaptive-chosen-plaintext attack. The one-way hash function is the core of the algorithm, so the security analysis of the algorithm is shifted to that of the hash function. If the core one-way hash function is chosen properly, it can be asserted that there would be no period in the HSC keystream. Firstly the algorithm was introduced detailedly. Then its applying security and efficiency respectively discussed deeply. The experimental result shows that the algorithm has both a high security and good efficiency. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","Hash function; Information security; Stream cipher","Adaptive systems; Algorithms; Computational efficiency; Computer crime; Function evaluation; Random processes; Hash functions; Hashing Stream Cipher (HSC); Pseudorandom keystreams; Security of data"

Because all of the nodes communicate each other based on the routing protocol, and an attacker could manipulate a lower-level protocol to interrupt a security mechanism in a higher-level one, securing routing protocol is an important issue in MANETs. Recently, there exist several proposals that attempt to architect a secure routing protocol for MANETs. Ariadne is the flagship protocol for securing the dynamic source routing protocol, and it can defend against the alteration of route message and prevent various types of Denial of Service attacks. Unfortunately, in 2006 Acs et al. stated Ariadne will suffer from a new attack, and proposed a provably secure on-demand source routing protocol, called ENDAIRA, against such an attack. However, their method is not actually secure against the Sybil and wormhole attacks. Therefore, in this paper we design a secure routing scheme using the self-certified public key cryptosystem, elliptic curve cryptosystem, pre-hashing, and nonce techniques against such attacks in ENDAIRA. Finally, we analyze the security and discuss the superiority about our proposed scheme.

The purpose of information security is to protect valuable assets, such as information, hardware, software and people. The majority of information security specialists believe that promoting good end user behavior and constraining bad end user behavior is an important component of an effective Information Security Management System (ISMS). Implementing effective information security involves understanding security-related risk, then developing and implementing appropriate controls. In general the better employees are at applying the controls the more secure the organization will be, because even the best designed technical controls and procedures will be of limited value if the staff involved do not understand why they have been implemented and what they are accomplishing. Achieving the required level of understanding usually requires more than an annual awareness training initiative and represents a major challenge for most organizations. In fact, for many organizations it will involve a cultural change to ensure the integration of information security concepts into the organizational culture. © 2007 IEEE.","","Computer software; Information dissemination; Information management; Societies and institutions; Corporate culture; Information loss; Information Security Management System (ISMS); News media; Security of data"

While cryptography is a powerful tool to achieve information security, one of the main challenges in cryptosystems is to maintain the secrecy of the cryptographic keys. Though biometric authentication can be used to ensure that only the legitimate user has access to the secret keys, a biometric system itself is vulnerable to a number of threats. A critical issue in biometric systems is to protect the template of a user which is typically stored in a database or a smart card. The fuzzy vault construct is a biometric cryptosystem that secures both the secret key and the biometric template by binding them within a cryptographic framework. We present a fully automatic implementation of the fuzzy vault scheme based on fingerprint minutiae. Since the fuzzy vault stores only a transformed version of the template, aligning the query fingerprint with the template is a challenging task. We extract high curvature points derived from the fingerprint orientation field and use them as helper data to align the template and query minutiae. The helper data itself do not leak any information about the minutiae template, yet contain sufficient information to align the template and query fingerprints accurately. Further, we apply a minutiae matcher during decoding to account for nonlinear distortion and this leads to significant improvement in the genuine accept rate. We demonstrate the performance of the vault implementation on two different fingerprint databases. We also show that performance improvement can be achieved by using multiple fingerprint impressions during enrollment and verification. © 2007 IEEE.","Biometric cryptosystems; Fingerprint alignment; Fuzzy vault; Helper data; Minutiae; Minutiae mosaicing; Polynomial reconstruction","Biometrics; Cryptography; Information retrieval; Polynomials; Query languages; Security of data; Automatic implementations; Biometric cryptosystems; Fingerprint alignment; Fingerprint orientation; Fuzzy logic"

In connection to this problem, we study the random variable ωa(N) with values in G whose distribution coincides with the conditional distribution of the random variable ω(N) under condition that χ(N) = a, where a is such that P(χ(N) = a) > 0.

However, the benefits of interconnectivity are not gained without risk. Though essential to support collaboration, increased use of information technology has removed internal and external protective barriers around an organization's assets and processes. Thus, supply chains are better able to satisfy the needs of customers while more vulnerable to an array of IT-specific risks. This chapter identifies the sources of IT threats in the supply chain, categorizes those threats, and validates them by means of a survey of 188 companies representing a range of supply chain functions. Analysis suggests that supply chain risk is affected by IT threats, and therefore the benefits of collaboration facilitated by IT integration must exceed the increase in risk due to IT security threats. © 2007, Idea Group Inc.","",""
