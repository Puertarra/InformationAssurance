These earlier security courses were the exclusive domain of faculty expert in particular technical areas. Nowadays it is only a slight exaggeration to state that it is difficult to find a sub-discipline of CS that is not relevant to this growing field. While the extreme diversity of IAS poses certain difficulties, it also opens up considerable opportunities for a wider range of faculty to develop a first course in IAS. Paradoxically, the immense diversity of the field has rendered specialized expertise less relevant than a more generalist approach. Hence, many more faculty than previous are in a position to develop and teach at least a first course in IAS. This claim is supported here.","Curriculum; Information assurance; New course; Security","Curricula; Cybernetics; Information science; Network security; Information assurance; New course; Security; Teaching"

Indeed, lasers allow for concentration of energy within tightly focused beams and narrow spectral interval, thus offering high throughput, information security, weight and size of components and power requirements that cannot be matched by RF systems. A key challenge is that high data rates should be complemented by high-precision wide-bandwidth position control of a laser beam. In many applications the ability to maintain a link is affected by the complex maneuvers performed by mobile communication platforms, resident vibrations, and atmospheric effects. This paper is focused on the application of acousto-optic technology, as an alternative to electro-mechanical devices, which addresses the tracking problems encountered under such conditions. It presents the developed electro-optical laboratory prototype, shows synthesis of the control system, and features experimental results that demonstrate excellent tracking performance.","Bragg cell; Kalman filter; Quadrant detector; Tracking","Bandwidth; Bragg cells; Control system synthesis; Electromechanical devices; High energy lasers; Interplanetary flight; Kalman filters; Laser beams; Military applications; Navigation systems; Optical links; Position control; Security of data; Surface discharges; Atmospheric effects; Concentration of energy; Deep space missions; Enabling technologies; Free space laser communications; Mobile communication platforms; Quadrant detectors; Tracking performance; Laser applications"

Since all computers in an organization are the potential virus victims and all the networks, including social networks and technological networks, are the possible virus vectors, we therefore view an organization as a combination of both and examine its social network and technological network simultaneously. This paper empirically examines a large-scale organizational network consisting of both social network and technological network. By applying information retrieval techniques, we are able to map nodes in the social network to nodes in the technological network to construct the composite network of the organization. We apply social network analysis to study the topologies of social and technological networks in an organization. We further statistically test the impact of the interplay between social and technological network on computer virus propagation using a susceptible-infective-recovered epidemic process. We find that computer viruses propagate faster but reach lower level of infection through technological network than through social network, and viruses propagate the fastest and reach the highest level of infection through the composite network. Overlooking the interplay of social network and technological network underestimates the virus propagation speed and the scale of infection.","Computer viruses; Information security; Interplay between social and technological networks; Social network analysis","Information technology; Security of data; Social networking (online); Computer virus propagation; Computing environments; Epidemic process; Holistic view; Networked organizations; Organizational network; Technological networks; Virus propagation; Computer viruses"

More of the attention on IT Governance is captured by compliance, owing to the recent financial scandals and the severe rules regarding information systems audit and control. Companies need to comply with these rules, but it requires important investments, considered not strategic but only necessary (Remenyi et. Al. 2000). However, companies should analyse the compliance requirements and to implement an IT governance system, not only to comply with legal rules, but also to improve the strategic alignment between IT and business and to optimise value creation by IT compliance investments (Ventrakaman and Henderson 1996, Van Grembergen 2003). Therefore, IT governance should have a complex set of goals, such as: to standardize and unify processes; to align information delivery with business needs; to control IT initiatives cost; to comply with external requirements. These goals are often opposed and difficult to pursue, because: they regard cross functional enterprise systems; they are strictly linked; they concern large databases and applications, very difficult to control. To optimise IT compliance it is useful to define a roadmap to IT compliance, orienting these activity to value creation, by realising scale, scope and experience economies in IT compliance activities. The accomplishment of this roadmap is the automation of IT compliance processes, using Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) standard solutions or developing in house systems, such as Enterprise Information Management (EIM) systems, to automatically manage processes, data and information security, access control, system performance and to data usability. In this paper, IT compliance topic is introduced, to define how to orient IT compliance to value creation; GRC systems and EIM systems are described, with their different cost and benefits for companies. Aim of the paper is to define how to develop compliance automated systems, to save money and enhance information integration and value. Observations and conclusions derive from practical experience of the author, participating to a project of EIM implementation in a major Italian company.","IT compliance; IT governance; IT management; Knowledge management","Automation; Decision making; Economics; Industry; Information systems; Investments; Knowledge management; Management information systems; Regulatory compliance; Security of data; Enterprise information management; Governance activities; Information integration; IT compliance; IT governance; IT management; Operational expenditures; Role of Information Systems; Compliance control"

The operation in MANETs' groups performs a decentralized manner and accommodated membership dynamically. Moreover, due to lack of centralized control, MANETs' groups are inherently insecure and vulnerable to attacks from both within and outside the groups. Such features make access control more challenging in MANETs. Recently, several researchers have proposed group access control mechanisms in MANETs based on a variety of threshold signatures. However, these mechanisms cannot actually satisfy MANETs' dynamic environments. This is because the threshold-based mechanisms cannot be achieved when the number of members is not up to the threshold value. Hence, by combining the efficient elliptic curve cryptosystem, self-certified public key cryptosystem and secure filter technique, we construct dynamic key management schemes based on hierarchical clustering for securing group access control in MANETs. Specifically, the proposed schemes can constantly accomplish secure group access control only by renewing the secure filters of few cluster heads, when a cluster head joins or leaves a cross-cluster. In such a new way, we can find that the proposed group access control scheme can be very effective for securing practical applications in MANETs. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.","Access control; Group communication; Hierarchical clustering; Information security; Mobile ad hoc networks",""

We formulate the problem using an analytical model in which the level of system vulnerability at any point in time potentially affects a variety of risk factors that are balanced to provide a multi-dimensional approach to information security management. The approach not only considers conventional factors such as detection rate and false positive rate, but also includes factors that account for hacker attack behavior and learning that occurs in response to actions taken by the firm to manage system risk. System vulnerability can be lowered by increasing the system's discrimination ability (i.e., the ability to distinguish between attacks and normal usage). The discrimination ability deteriorates due to changes in the domain and through the dissemination of information about the system's vulnerabilities among hackers. The problem is solved to reveal the presence of a steady-state solution, one in which the level of system discrimination ability is held constant. We provide insights into managing various dimensions of risk in a consolidated risk management framework.","","Industrial management; Industry; Information technology; Personal computing; Risk management; Security of data; Detection rates; Discrimination ability; False positive rates; Information security managements; Multi-dimensional approach; Risk management framework; Steady state solution; System vulnerability; Information management"

The work presented focuses exclusively on the availability goal; in particular, maintaining the availability of the physical layer link in an omnidirectional wireless communications system. Hostile jamming is a direct attack on the availability of an information resource. As the United States develops the Global Information Grid (GIG), key management will be a challenging problem. While much progress has been made utilizing asymmetric cryptography and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to manage keys that encrypt, decrypt, and authenticate data, the keys used to protect the physical communication layer from hostile jamming are highly vulnerable. In particular, battlefield ad hoc wireless networks are at significant risk. Preferred jam resistant methods rely on highly-directional links (e.g., beam-forming antennas, lasers, or physical cable), but realistic operational environments will continue to rely heavily on omnidirectional radio frequency (RF) links as well. Presently, such links rely on spread spectrum techniques for jam-resistance, all which currently require symmetric (shared-secret) keys. While shared-secret schemes are workable in small networks, the scale and nature of theater-wide, mobile, ad-hoc wireless networks will quickly overwhelm any practical key management strategy. Not only will the initial distribution of keys be difficult, but preventing keys from being compromised and re-keying when the inevitable compromises occur will place extreme burdens on the system. In addition, commercial systems such as cellular phone networks face similar challenges as their need for jam resistance becomes more evident. Furthermore, public-access systems such as the civilian side of the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system preclude reliance on secret keys since, by definition, the pool of authorized users includes everyone. Yet while civilian GPS is recognized as having little jam-resistance, the present trend calls for increased reliance on it for civil aviation. The availability goal in such large-scale and/or public access omnidirectional systems can only be achieved if the physical layer link can remain available in the face of significant hostile jamming even without a shared secret in place. This paper describes the first algorithms that make unkeyed jam-resistant omnidirectional physical links possible: the BBC encoding and decoding algorithms. We describe these algorithms and how they can be implemented in suitable physical layers. Such physical layers, while not secure in and of themselves, can serve as the foundation upon which well-established asymmetric techniques can be used to construct secure communications channels.","Jam-resistance; Physical layer; Spread spectrum","Access control; Algorithms; Global positioning system; Jamming; Local area networks; Mobile ad hoc networks; Network layers; Public key cryptography; Spectroscopy; Tracking (position); Wireless networks; Global Information Grid(GIG); Global positioning satellites; Jam-resistance; Physical layers; Public-key infrastructure; Spread spectra; Spread spectrum techniques; Wireless communications system; Omnidirectional antennas"

A cornerstone of this success will be the ability of Information Assurance professionals to develop sound security requirements and determine the suitability of evaluated security products for mission-specific systems. Recognizing the pedagogical value of applying security evaluation criteria such as the Common Criteria (CC) to information security education, we recently introduced a graduate-level Computer Science course focusing on methodical security requirements engineering based on the CC. This course aims to provide students with an understanding of how security evaluation criteria can be used to specify system security objectives, derive security requirements from security objectives, establish life cycle and development processes, and provide an organizational framework for research and development. Although imperfect, the paradigmatic process of the CC provides a usable framework for in-depth study of various tasks relating to system requirements derivation and verification activities: system requirements elicitation, threat analysis, security objectives definition and security requirements expression. In-class discussions address fundamental security design principles and disciplines for information and software assurance (e.g., formal methods and life cycle management) as applied to security requirements derivation. Coverage of advanced CC topics includes high assurance evaluation, international and U.S. scheme interpretation processes, guidance for Protection Profile development, CC evaluation methodology, and composite evaluation. This paper describes the scope and design of a pilot course offering. Laboratory projects focus on the differences between security functional and assurance requirements, mock evaluation of a draft Protection Profile, examination of the interpretation process in the U.S. scheme, and development of a preliminary sketch of a Composed Assurance Package for a hypothetical composed target system that is suitable for use in operational environments requiring medium robustness.

Typically, the more employees use a network, the more valuable it becomes. The challenge is daunting: security must protect business information while allowing for open communication and commerce. Looking to nature for security approaches can yield insights into how we can better meet this challenge. In this regard, biological cells offer a security strategy that is interesting and worth emulating. After studying security mechanisms in cells, we found that security mechanisms are present in nearly every cell component. Cells follow a multilayered, defense-in-depth approach to security. In this chapter, we offer a framework that examines the similarities between cell security and network security. In today’s high-technology environment, in which security is increasingly important, this framework can help us by stimulating thinking about security while offering a model about how to design secure systems. Before we discuss the various analogies between cells and networks, we will briefly mention what biologists call “cell theory.” Understanding the basics of cell theory helps explain why cells are useful to study as a security framework. The premise of cell theory states that all living things are made up of cells-it is the fundamental unit of structure in all life. A single cell can be a complete organism in itself or cells can work together to become the building blocks of large multicellular organisms such as a human being. Although differences exist between plant and animal cells or blood and skin cells, the similarities are substantial. Because cells are considered the fundamental structure of life, we argue that it is worth examining cells because they highlight important principles valuable to today’s security professional. Figure 18.1 illustrates the fundamental architecture of a cell. For each identified cell component in the figure, we name an analogous computer network counterpart. In the following section, we will briefly examine the key aspects of this figure while providing four analogies that highlight similarities between cells and networks. As a conclusion, we offer five valuable principles based on cell security that are useful to the information security professional. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

As the threats have grown in scope, they have grown beyond the boundaries of the enterprise. In the beginning, battling malicious code was a desktop-only concern. The viruses attacked a single computer, our tools defended individual computers. The targets of viruses were files or boot sectors of disks. At first our tools were integrity checkers that confirmed known goodness. Later we began to recognize bad code and created small signatures that we could count on to discriminate bad code from good. The use of antivirus programs was not widespread. During the time that signatures were being developed, several private databases (like Patricia Huffman’s VSum) were used by information security professionals to recognize the signs of a virus infection. Information security professionals compared observed behavior and characteristics with the database entries to determine if they matched a known virus. Using this method, the individual information security professional could find viruses for which no signatures had been developed. Information security professionals would use the database to search for entries that included the behavior or files that they had observed. In this way they might recognize a virus even if no signature had been developed for this particular strain. The behavior was recognizable even if bits had been twiddled to avoid matching an existing signature. It was a heuristic process that was later emulated in antivirus products. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The need for effective insider threat detection, prevention, and mitigation is driven by the growing number and magnitude of reported losses resulting from both malicious and non-malicious insider information incidents. Insiders have a significant advantage in that they are trusted; possess elevated privileges when compared to external users; have knowledge about technical and non-technical control measures; and, in some cases, can bypass security measures designed to prevent unauthorized access. Traditional security architectures focusing only upon perimeter defenses often do not provide the capability to efficiently identify and attribute fraud, information exfiltration, and sabotage to a trusted insider. Given this combination of insider access, knowledge, and the lack of insider threat detection measures, identifying and mitigating insider threats is a challenging task. The problem is further complicated by the difficulty in quantifying the costs and benefits when making risk tradeoff decisions to mitigate insider risk. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of a generic, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) weapon system architecture in order to identify risks arising from susceptibility to insider attacks; consider the application of insider threat detection technologies, policies, and processes to mitigate risks; and discuss challenges that program managers face when making risk trade-off decisions in embedded weapons systems. Embedded weapon systems present several unique challenges when assigning controls to mitigate insider risks. Operational requirements, budget, schedule, and culture often constrain the application of ""best practice"" security solutions and drive the need to develop alternate layered security strategies to mitigate insider risks. Through our analysis, we intend to identify appropriate insider threat security control measures that can enhance a generic UAV weapon systems architecture and security posture.","Detection; Insider; Insider threat; Malicious insider; Threat indicators; Weapon system","Application programs; Crime; Embedded systems; Error detection; Risk management; Security of data; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Information infrastructures; Insider; Insider Threat; Insider threat detections; Malicious insiders; Operational requirements; Security Architecture; Weapon system; Risk assessment"

The reliable operation of modern infrastructures depends on computerized systems and SCADA systems. Since the emergence of Internet and World Wide Web technologies, these systems were integrated with business systems and became more exposed to cyber threats. There is a growing concern about the security and safety of the SCADA control systems. The Presidential Decision Directive 63 document est ablished the framework to protect the critical infrastruct ure an d the Presidential document of 2003, the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace stated that securing SCADA systems is a national priority. T he critical infrastructure includes telecommunication, transportation, energy, banking, finance, water supply, emergency services, government services, agriculture, an d other fundamental systems and services that are critical to the security, economic prosperity, and social well-being of the public. The critical infrastructure is characterized by interdependencies (physical, cyber, geographic, and logical) and complexity (collections of interacting components). Therefore, information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems without exception. Critical infrastructure disruptions can directly an d indirectly affect other infrastructures, impact large geographic regions, an d send ripples throughout the national an d global economy. For example, under normal operating conditions, the electric power in frastructure requires fuels (natural gas and petroleum), transportation, water, banking and finance, telecommunication, and SCADA systems for monitoring and control. In this paper, we provide an analysis of key developments, architecture, potential vulnerabilities, and security concerns including recommendations toward improving security for SCADA control systems. We discuss the most important issues concerning the security of SCADA systems including a perspective on enhancing security of these systems. We briefly describe the SCADA architecture, and identify t he attributes that increase the complexity of these systems including the key developments that mark the evolution of the SCADA control systems along with the growth of potential vulnerabilities and security concerns. Then, we provide recommendations toward an enhanced security for SCADA control systems. More efforts should be planned on reducing the vulnerabilities and improving the security operations of these systems. It is necessary to address not only t he individual vulnerabilit ies, but the breadth of risks that can interfere with critical operations. We describe key requirements and features needed to improve the security of t he current SCADA control systems. For example, in assessing the risk for SCADA systems, use of general methods for risk analysis including specific conditions and characteristics of a control system need to be applied. Effective risk analysis for SCADA systems requires a unified definition for mishap an d identification of potential harm to safety. As computer systems are more integrated, the distinction between security and safety is beginning to disappear. In bridging the gap between these domains, we propose a unified risk framework which combines a new definition of mishap with an expanded definition of hazard to include the security event. However, methods for risk management that are based on automated tools and intelligent techniques are more beneficial to SCADA systems because they require minimum or no human intervention in controlling the processes. We also identify a unified security/safety risk framework for control systems. Implementing security features ensures higher security, reliability, an d availability of control systems. Thus organizations need to reassess the SCADA control systems an d risk model to achieve in depth defense solutions for these systems. The increasing threats against SCADA control systems indicate that there should be more directions in the development of these systems. Therefore, achieving better quality an d more secure SCADA control systems is a high priority. Information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems with out exception. We conclude with a thought about the future of SCADA control systems. A strategy to deal with cyber attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure requires first understanding the full nature of the threat. A depth defense and proactive solutions to improve the security of SCADA control systems ensures the future of control systems and survivability of critical infrastructure.","Critical infrastructure; Cyber security; Industrial control system; Requirements; Risk management; SCADA control system; Security framework","Control system analysis; Critical infrastructures; Electric power system control; Emergency services; Industrial management; Information management; Malware; Man machine systems; Natural gas transportation; Network security; Petroleum transportation; Process control; Public works; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security systems; Telecommunication services; Water supply; Cyber security; Industrial control systems; Information security managements; Normal operating conditions; Presidential decision directives; Requirements; Security frameworks; Supervisory control and data acquisition; SCADA systems"

We are experimenting with a different approach: a lower division undergraduate course that introduces students to the concepts of boundaries and information flows. Professional security engineers often analyze problems in terms of these basic concepts. The course introduces security concepts by starting with security issues of small scale perimeters, and incrementally expands the scope by looking in turn at shared single computers, local area networks, and the Internet.","","Engineering education; Students; Basic concepts; Information flows; Security engineers; Security issues; Single computer; Software systems; Technical college; Undergraduate Courses; Security of data"

Some of these texts are guidelines specifically addressed toward information security such as British Standard (BS) 7799 and its descendants, particularly the International Standards Organization (ISO) 27000 family of standards. In this category are also items such as the (free, regarding both charge and access) “self-assessment questionnaire” prepared by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (identified among their publications as 800-26). There have been a number of projects that attempted to produce similar sets of standards or practice lists, such as the now-moribund Commonly Accepted Security Practices and Recommendations and two versions of Generally Accepted System Security Principles: these listed undertakings have been amalgamated into Generally Accepted Information Security Principles. Other frameworks are peripherally related, but have come to be seen as having a bearing on system security. Probably the most widely known are the auditing standards and outlines such as Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) and the variety of supporting documents and processes that have grown up around the U.S. Federal Information Systems Management Act (FISMA). Others are more distantly associated, such as the Common Criteria (CC) on specifications and evaluation. Still others are even more tenuously connected, such as the advice on fraudulent financial reporting from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Seen as dynamic processes, the first kind of exploit is a controlling ('balancing') feedback loop, while the second kind is a reinforcing feedback loop. Each type of exploit meets a first line of defence in control processes or in escalating ('reinforcing') processes of resistance. The possible combinations of the two modes of attack and the two modes of defence yield four archetypes of exploit and natural defence. Predictably, the social engineer would seek to outsmart the first line of defence; it is shown that each archetype implies a particular strategy to do so. Anticipation of these modes of attack must be the starting point for an effective multilayered defence against social engineering attacks.

Given the escalating threats of malicious cyber attacks, modern enterprises employ multiple lines of defense. A comprehensive defense strategy against such attacks should include: (1) an attack detection component that determines the fact that a system is compromised, (2) an attack identification and prevention component that identifies attack packets so that one can block such packets in the future and prevent the attack from further propagation. Over the last decade, significant research time has been invested in systems that can detect cyber attacks, either statically at compile time, or dynamically at run time. However, not much effort has been spent on automated attack packet identification or attack prevention. In this paper, we present a unified solution to these problems. We implemented this solution after reverse engineering an Open Source Security Information Management (OSSIM) system, called Preventive Information Security Management (PrISM) system, which correlates input from different sensors so that the resulting product can automatically detect any cyber attack against it, and prevent attack by identifying the actual attack packet(s). PrISM was always able to detect the attacks, identify the attack packets and most often prevent attack by blocking the attacker's IP address to continue normal execution. There is no additional run-time performance overhead for attack prevention. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Computer Security; Information Security Management System; Intrusion Detection; Intrusion Prevention; Network security","Computer crime; Crime; Industrial management; Information management; Intrusion detection; Open systems; Prisms; Reverse engineering; Security of data; Attack prevention; Automatic Detection; Information security management systems; Information security managements; Intrusion prevention; Run-time performance; Security information managements; Unauthorized access; Network security"

Tools for generating attacks on existing Information Technology infrastructure are readily available. These attacks can easily evade detection from today's countermeasures. Information theft is thus an important threat vector for networked communities where sensitive information is exchanged with partners in different administrative domains, with dissimilar security policies and configurations. The combination of disparately managed networks, ability to store information offline, and remote access functionality complicate the enforcement of information security policies. We tackle the issue of protecting sensitive information by applying a systemintegrity and information-auditing perspective. We believe this is the first step towards mitigating insider abuse of data-use privileges. We present a Virtualization- enabled Framework for Information Traceability (VFIT) to prevent unauthorized handling of sensitive information. We show that this hardware platform on which information is created, transformed and stored is a key enforcement point to provide accountable information flow. We describe the application of our previous work on Virtualization-enabled Integrity Service (VIS) to implement VFIT. Our approach is data-centric and provides a mechanism that can deterministically audit use of information while it is in use in volatile or non-volatile memory. Using this mechanism, we describe how existing network security mechanisms and our proposed framework can be applied to applications to provide traceability for sensitive information in a distributed system.","",""

Over the years we have seen malware evolve from simple viruses written in assembly language to complex programs that deliver advanced functionality that greatly facilitates the ability of perpetrators to accomplish their sordid purposes. In this chapter we have termed rootkits “the ultimate malware threat,” something that is no embellishment whatsoever. When it comes to sophistication and potential for damage, loss, and destruction, few, if any, types of malware can compare to rootkits. With the constant news about viruses, worms, and Trojan horse programs, however, rootkits have somehow gotten “lost in the fog.” This chapter is intended to serve as a wake-up call-it is time for information security professionals to become aware of exactly what rootkits are, what they can do, what risks they pose, and possible solutions for countering them. Information security professionals are constantly concerned about a wide variety of securityrelated threats. Some of these threats pose considerably higher levels of risk than others and thus require more resources to counter. Furthermore, risks and their potential impact change over time. In the 1990s, for example, risks resulting from the activity of external attackers were some of the most serious. Attackers often launched brute-force password-guessing attacks or, if they were more sophisticated, password-cracking attacks using dictionary-based password-cracking tools that are by today’s standards rather crude. During that time, damage and disruption due to virus and worm infections also comprised one of the most serious types of security risks. Things have changed considerably since then; certain types of malware other than viruses and worms have moved to the forefront of risks that organizations currently face. Rootkits in particular now represent what might safely be called the ultimate malware threat. This chapter covers the ins and outs of rootkits, the relationship between rootkits and security-related risk, how to prevent rootkits from being installed in the first place, and how to detect them and recover when rootkits have been installed in victim systems. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Correspondingly, there are two possible solutions for restricting access to spatial information in database: the SDE-based access control mechanism and the view-based access control mechanism. In the SDE-based mechanism, we have to modify the source code of SDE and alter the schemas of spatial tables to realize access control functionalities. In the view-based mechanism, we use the view techniques to define various views to meet different security requirements, and then authorizing privileges to views. The basic components of an access control system mainly contain user authentication, authorization rule repository, PEP, PDP, and PIP, which are distributed and implemented differently in the two mechanisms.

While these items are very important, they are only half of the equation necessary to ensure security success. CISO Soft Skills: Securing Organizations Impaired by Employee Politics, Apathy, and Intolerant Perspectives presents tools that empower security practitioners to identify the intangible negative influencers of security that plague most organizations, and provides techniques to identify, minimize, and overcome these pitfalls. The book begins by explaining how using the wrong criteria to measure security can result in a claim of adequate security when objective assessment demonstrates this not to be the case. The authors instead recommend that organizations measure the success of their efforts using a practical approach that illustrates both the tangible and intangible requirements needed by a healthy security effort. The middle section discusses the root causes that negatively influence both a CISO and an organization’s ability to truly secure itself. These root causes include: Employee apathy Employee myopia or tunnel vision Employee primacy, often exhibited as office politics The infancy of the information security discipline These chapters explain what a CISO can do about these security constraints, providing numerous practical and actionable exercises, tools, and techniques to identify, limit, and compensate for the influence of security constraints in any type of organization. The final chapters discuss some proactive techniques that CISOs can utilize to effectively secure challenging work environments. Reflecting the experience and solutions of those that are in the trenches of modern organizations, this volume provides practical ideas that can make a difference in the daily lives of security practitioners. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Patient rehabilitation; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Security systems; Middle section; Objective assessment; Security constraint; Security measure; Security policy; Security practitioners; Tunnel vision; Work environments; Personnel"

In the long run, it can impact customer relationships or create serious financial damage from fraud, information theft, or public disclosure of intellectual properties. This problem has presented information technology with a technological challenge because the ideal network data protection solution should require no change to network infrastructure, should not impact network performance, must work over any network topology, and must secure any type of traffic. The challenge facing information security professionals is to secure data in motion as has never been possible before. It is obvious that encryption is the solution to addressing confidentiality and integrity of the data while it transits lines that we have no control over; however, its limitations have hampered its deployment, especially on large-scale networks. Standards are normally present when interoperability among different vendor solutions should take place, and multiple good ones have been used, for example, the Internet Protocol security (IPSec) standard framework. Although IPSec delivered a portion of the solution, it also introduced its own limitations and unnecessary overlay to an existing network infrastructure, making it even more difficult to manage, maintain, and operate. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

According to the 2007 Socha-Gelbmann Electronic Discovery Survey, it is now a $2 billion industry, a 60% increase from 2004, projected to double by 2009. The core reason for the explosion of e-discovery is sheer volume; evidence is digital and 75% of modern day lawsuits entail e-discovery. A recent survey reports that U.S. companies face an average of 305 pending lawsuits internationally. For large U.S. companies ($1 billion or more in revenue)that number has soared to 556 on average, with an average of 50 new disputes emerging each year for nearly half of them. To properly manage the role of digital information in an investigative or legal setting, an enterprise--whether it is a Fortune 500 company, a small accounting firm or a vast government agency--must develop an effective electronic discovery program. Since the amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which took effect in December 2006, it is even more vital that the lifecycle of electronically stored information be understood and properly managed to avoid risks and costly mistakes. This books holds the keys to success for systems administrators, information security and other IT department personnel who are charged with aiding the e-discovery process. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Another form of denying availability is to prevent communication through the use of traditional jamming techniques. At the United States Air Force Academy Center for Information Security, we have been working on a new algorithm, BBC, which is based on a new type of coding theory known as concurrent codes that is resistant to traditional jamming techniques. While the formal definition and proofs of concurrent codes can be daunting, the algorithm's effectiveness can be easily conveyed and appreciated through visual demonstration.

It's necessary, therefore, to use a communications system that enables people in heterogeneous organization to communicate effectively. Since 2002, Swan Island Networks has been developing an Internet-based information sharing system that links responsible people with the information necessary to make better decisions, and to each other. The system allows people to form ""Communities of Trust"", in which all community members are known and authenticated. Each community is formed by a responsible Champion, who determines who can participate and what information will be shared within the community. In order for people to be willing to share, and to accept the information they receive as genuine, the community must operate in an environment of trust. This presentation outlines the fundamental concepts, methodologies and features for access and information control that create a trusted environment, particularly Authorization, Authentication and Audit (AAA). In the system discussed, AAA elements function together to create a comprehensive trust framework, and provide a contextually appropriate level of information assurance, data protection and dissemination control.","","Information systems; Security of data; Communications systems; Dissemination controls; Fundamental concepts; Information assurance; Information control; Information sharing systems; Operational continuity; Trust frameworks; Authentication"

However, the globalisation of business and the growth of the digital networked economy means that virtually any business process can be undertaken by someone else, somewhere in the world. This has resulted in a rapid and substantial increase in the outsourcing of a wide range of activities and operational processes. In turn, this means that components of national infrastructures and information security are also effectively outsourced. Whether the sourcing is in country or offshore this commercial reality results in a growing number of third parties and contractors (many of whom will be foreign nationals) who are given long term access to critical assets, systems and information. These people work within the extended boundaries of companies, often with privileged access rights and varying levels of operational control, but typically with lower levels of company and country affinity, loyalty and trust. The threat of attack from insiders is therefore growing and appropriate risk assessments and security controls must be implemented in a consistent and agile fashion. This paper describes the tools and techniques used by BT to ensure that the core factors relating to insider threats are prominent in security risk assessments and lists a set of security countermeasures pertinent to most cases. The global sourcing environment is dynamic and risk assessments must not be one-off tactical exercises but part of an ongoing process to develop risk management strategies and compliance regimes.","Critical national infrastructure; Insider threat; Outsourcing; Security risk assessments","Industry; Outsourcing; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Digital networked economy; Infrastructure protection; Insider Threat; National infrastructure; Risk management strategies; Security countermeasures; Security risk assessments; Systems and information; Critical infrastructures"

Malicious Bots: An Inside Look into the Cyber-Criminal Underground of the Internet explores the rise of dangerous bots and exposes the nefarious methods of ""botmasters"". This valuable resource assists information security managers in understanding the scope, sophistication, and criminal uses of bots. With sufficient technical detail to empower IT professionals, this volume provides in-depth coverage of the top bot attacks against financial and government networks over the last several years. The book presents exclusive details of the operation of the notorious Thr34t Krew, one of the most malicious bot herder groups in recent history. Largely unidentified by anti-virus companies, their bots spread globally for months, launching massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and warez (stolen software distributions). For the first time, this story is publicly revealed, showing how the botherders got arrested, along with details on other bots in the world today. Unique descriptions of the criminal marketplace - how criminals make money off of your computer - are also a focus of this exclusive book! With unprecedented detail, the book goes on to explain step-by-step how a hacker launches a botnet attack, providing specifics that only those entrenched in the cyber-crime investigation world could possibly offer. Authors Ken Dunham and Jim Melnick serve on the front line of critical cyber-attacks and countermeasures as experts in the deployment of geopolitical and technical bots. Their work involves advising upper-level government officials and executives who control some of the largest networks in the world. By examining the methods of Internet predators, information security managers will be better able to proactively protect their own networks from such attacks. © 2009 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Botnet; Denial-of-service attack; Managers; Network security; Personal computing; Security systems; Cyber criminals; Cyber-attacks; Distributed denial of service attack; Government officials; Identity theft; IT professional; Software distributions; Technical details; Crime"

While most malware is blocked by software using rule-based signature systems or heuristics to determine functionality and respond, malware detection mechanisms are limited by the robustness of their classification systems and existing definitions. Software cracking and code reverse engineering, by contrast, are creative activities where an attacker typically employs novel solutions to circumvent protection systems and to prevent his own actions from being detected. Currently, there is no capability that totally prevents or detects code reverse engineering activities. To perfectly prevent reverse engineering of software, a system designer would have to be able to completely specify all potential attack vectors and then to implement countermeasures which address each type of attack vector. The first part of autonomically responding to a threat action is to detect it. Potential answers to the detection problem lie in artificial intelligence research, but even the most advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are currently unable to produce a system which can detect a completely novel attack vector. Human cognition abilities, on the other hand, allow a person to recognize a novel event like an attack even if it does not fall into the typical categories of what that person expects for that given event. This paper discusses Jean Piaget's cognitive development model and maps the phases of that model to different representations in computational intelligence. This mapping highlights the current state of the art of artificial intelligence and autonomic problem solving and highlights limitations of currently available approaches. This mapping will enable researchers to move toward developing theoretical and technological improvements in the hopes of detecting even novel code reverse engineering activities. This paper explores some different paths to be able to replicate the ability in a computer to detect a novel attack, classify novel events and circumstances, develop classification systems on-the-fly, and cross boundaries of classifications.","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive science; Computational intelligence; Information security; Reverse engineering","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Computer viruses; Security of data; Artificial intelligence research; Classification system; Cognitive development; Cognitive science; Engineering activities; Machine learning technology; Protection systems; Technological improvements; Reverse engineering"

However, traditional expected value methods (such as annual loss expectancy) cannot fully characterize the information security risk confronted by organizations, considering some extremal yet perhaps relatively rare cases in which a security failure may be critical and cause high losses. In this research note we introduce the concept of value-at-risk to measure the risk of daily losses an organization faces due to security exploits and use extreme value analysis to quantitatively estimate the value at risk. We collect a set of internal daily activity data from a large financial institution in the northeast United States and then simulate its daily losses with information based on data snapshots and interviews with security managers at the institution. We illustrate our methods using these simulated daily losses. With this approach, decision makers can make a proper investment choice based on their own risk preference instead of pursuing a solution that minimizes only the expected cost. © 2008 INFORMS.","Extreme value analysis; Information assurance; Security investment; Value-at-risk (VaR)","Decision making; Investments; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Security of data; Extreme value analysis; Financial institution; Information assurance; Information security investment; Information security risks; Security failure; Security investments; Value at Risk; Value engineering"

We can also characterize Nash equilibria and social optima for different classes of attacks and defenses. In the weakest-target game, an interesting result is that, for almost all parameter settings, more effort is exerted at Nash equilibrium than at the social optimum.

In the world of permanent cyber attacks to ICT systems, risk management is becoming a crucial task for minimization of the potential risks that can endeavor their operation. The prevention of the heavy losses that may happen due to cyber attacks and other information system failures in an organization is usually associated with continuous investment in different security measures and purchase of data protection systems. With the rise of the potential risks the investment in security services and data protection is growing and is becoming a serious economic issue to many organizations and enterprises. This paper analyzes several approaches enabling assessment of the necessary investment in security technology from the economic point of view. The paper introduces methods for identification of the assets, the threats, the vulnerabilities of the ICT systems and proposes a procedure that enables selection of the optimal investment of the necessary security technology based on the quantification of the values of the protected systems.

For this purpose, we introduce a new attack against this protocol and use the birthday paradox to model the number of operations until the proposed attack is successful. The modeling process, which results in the estimation of the upper bound effort for this successful attack, gives way to the definition of enhancements for the identification protocol. As a result, we define a new identification protocol based on multiple integer challenge-responses that, though not being a cryptographic protocol, represents for an attacker a challenge harder than breaking a symmetric cryptographic key by brute force attack.

The survey reveals that next to malware infection and theft of IT equipment, hacking is the most commonly reported computer crime incident. The findings also document that there are large differences in security practices between large and small enterprises, even when it comes to measures one would have thought that all enterprises independent of size would have implemented. This practice may put small enterprises in a position of high risk. This is also worrying in a national context as small enterprises make up the majority of the total number of enterprises.

I describe how many of these factors are manifesting themselves in an effort by our research group to transition rigorous static analyses and novel Hoare-style logics into a large industrial development process for information assurance and security applications. The applications that we are targeting address the following problem: international infrastructure and defense forces are increasingly relying on complex systems that share information with multiple levels of security (MLS). In such systems, there is a strong tension between providing aggressive information flow to gain operational and strategic advantage while preventing leakage to unauthorized parties. In this context, it is exceedingly difficult to specify and certify security policies, and produce evidence that a system provides end-to-end trust. In the past, verification and certification obligations in this domain have been met by using heavy-weight theorem proving technology that requires many manual steps or by light-weight contract-based static analyses that are too imprecise for specifying and verifying crucial information flow properties. In this talk, I will explain how our research team is (a) building integrated tool support for automatically discovering and visualizing information flows through programs and architectures, and (b) providing code-integrated software contracts for specifying information flow policies, and (c) applying synergistic blends of static analyses and automated reasoning based on weakest-precondition calculi to aid developers in automatically discharging verification obligations. These techniques aim to hit a ""sweet spot"" that provides greater automation and developer integration than previous theorem-proving-based approaches while offering increased precision over previous static-analysis-based frameworks.

Furthermore, a protocol is designed for updating certificates for satellites; different policies for updating primary and session keys are studied and their efficiency and security are analyzed and compared. In addition, simulation environment for satellite networks is built and the key updating processes are implemented in Walker constellation. From the simulation results, further contrasts on key updating time and storage costs between the applications of IBM hybrid key management model (HKMM) and DKM-SN in satellite networks are presented.

The TS/MB algorithm makes use of Markov blanket neighborhoods: restricted neighborhoods in a general Bayesian network based on the Markov condition. Computational results from real-world data sets drawn from several domains indicate that the TS/MB algorithm, when used as a feature selection method, is able to find a parsimonious model with substantially fewer predictor variables than is present in the full data set.

Although much research has been done on qualitative approaches, the literature on numerical approaches to quantify information-security risk is scarce. This paper suggests a method to quantify risk in terms of a numeric value or ""degree of cybersecurity"". To help quantitatively measure the level of cybersecurity for a computer-based information system, we present two indices, the threat-impact index and the cyber-vulnerability index, based on vulnerability trees. By calculating and comparing the indices for various possible security enhancements, managers can select the best security enhancement choice, prioritize the choices by their relative effectiveness, and statistically justify spending resources on the selected choice. By qualifying information security quantitatively, the method can also help managers establish a specific target of security level that they can track. We illustrate the use of the proposed methodology on the security of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems using data from the SCADA system test bed implemented at the University of Louisville as a case study, and then show the use of the proposed indices on this information system before and after two security enhancements. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Secondly, to reduce response time, a novel approach of pointed reporting was suggested, where responsibilities were distributed across the institution, based on relevant roles. In this approach, security exceptions are reported directly to the predefined roles, responsible for that particular security control. This pointed reporting, delivers message to the right person in minimum time, resulting in improved response time.

While intrusion prevention provides immediate/real-time protection, it suffers from two deficiencies, which are the sensitivity and specificity trade-off and the accuracy and efficiency trade-off. To address these issues, we introduce two models of intrusion prevention. The first model is for a hybrid system playing both detection and protection roles.

A UK-based graphic designer David Airey checked his mail to find out that his Gmail account has been attacked and he was a victim of an extortion attempt. Mail filters could allow malicious individuals to forward a victim's incoming e-mails to another address for eavesdropping on the target user's e-mail. The filters configured in Airey's Gmail account enabled the domain hijacker to receive the authentication code required to complete the transfer. Attackers can support JavaScript in a cross-site request forgery to increase attack complexity, chain actions together, or even install persistent backdoors that run in the browser. The simplest way to avoid cross-site request forgery is to log out of Web-based applications when they are not in use. Gmail users are advised to review the filter settings in their account configurations.","","Computer graphics; Electronic mail; Java programming language; Security of data; Domain hijacker; JavaScript; Computer crime"

The mechanisms of state censorship of Internet communication for Uzbek citizens and the restrictions that narrow the scope of freedom of expression in the context of the Internet are the issues in focus. The article argues that the Uzbek government, although publicly committed to democracy and respect for the rule of law under the Constitution, favors regulation that undermines the human right to freedom of expression on both legal and ideological grounds-namely, by enforcing the legal rules on information security and the ideological 'idea of national independence'. The article demonstrates that the absence of legal guarantees of the effective exercise of freedom of expression on the Internet reflects upon the general weakness of Uzbekistan's domestic system of human rights protection. This system gives absolute priority to state interests in legitimizing restrictions upon human rights. The article concludes that the impairment of the right to freedom of expression is inevitable in Uzbekistan unless the government makes an effort to pay full respect to human rights and implement in practice its obligations under international human rights law. © 2008 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.","Freedom of expression; Information security; Internet content regulation; Internet media; Uzbekistan",""

When we build large-scale systems based on commercial component middleware platforms, such as those compliant to J2EE, a usual way to enforce access control is to define Access Control Configurations (ACCs) for components in a declarative manner. These ACCs can be enforced by the J2EE security service to grant or deny access requests to components. However, it is difficult for the developers to define correct ACCs according to complex and sometimes ambiguous real-world access control requirements. Faults of ACCs in large-scale J2EE applications may inevitably occur due to various reasons, for example ad hoc mistakes of the developers.

A large number of key management schemes have been proposed for access control in hierarchy. Their constructions are based mainly on one-way functions and are computationally secure. Many of these schemes were however, found with different problems in terms of structure, security, efficiency and dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new key management scheme that can be used for access control in dynamic hierarchies. The new scheme is based on the secret sharing principle, without using a one-way function. Consequently, it is unconditionally secure. In addition, it has the following properties: (i) supporting full dynamics at both node and user levels; (ii) allowing any random reconfiguration of access hierarchy; (iii) utilizing the same algorithm for key computation and also descendant key derivation (regardless how far its descendant is away from the node); and (iv) eliminating performance bottlenecks at the trusted Central Authority (CA).","Hierarchical access control (HAC); Information security; Information theory; Key management; Secret sharing; Symmetric polynomial","Computation theory; Information theory; Security of data; Cryptographic techniques; Hierarchical access control; Key management; Key management schemes; Performance bottlenecks; Secret sharing; Symmetric polynomial; Unconditionally secure; Access control"

The method also provides a numerical estimate of the credibility of the information security score, so that an assessment based on few and uncertain pieces of evidence is associated with low credibility and an assessment based on a large set of trustworthy evidence is associated with high credibility. A common problem with information security assessments is the cost related to collecting the required evidence.

Data fusion, in which collected data are fused before they are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the wireless sensor network. Since a sensor is typically placed in locations that are accessible to malicious attackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important. A witness-based approach has been proposed to verify the fusion data. In this approach, the base station receives the fusion data and ""votes"" on the data from a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes, called ""witnesses,"" to confirm the correctness of the fusion data. Since the base station receives the vote through the chosen node, this node could forge the vote if it is compromised.. This work improves the witness-based approach using a direct voting mechanism, such that the proposed scheme performs better in terms of assurance, overhead and delay. The witness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery does not pose a problem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the vote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed approach has a 40-times lower overhead than the witness-based approach. © 2008 IEEE.","Data fusion assurance; Power-efficient; Voting mechanism; Wireless sensor networks; Witness","Base stations; Computer simulation; Data fusion; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Performance analysis; Power-efficient; Voting mechanism; Wireless sensor networks"

As opposed to conventional terrorist organizations, with their hierarchical structures that are vertically designed, cyberterrorist organizations are actually not organizations. They do not exhibit an intrinsically ""group"" or ""design"" nature. Rather, they are volatile and unexpected, a very postmodern attribute. The postmodern concept of hyperreal is described in this analysis. ""Hyperreal"" suggests a ""reality"" that supersedes the world. As such, cyberspace is the new public sphere and it is postmodern; it treasures the concept of the ""public"" while disengaging it from any particular time or place. As a result, the postmodern map of cyberspace becomes the totality itself, superseding the world. Hyperreal also implies that cyberspace enables the ""self"" to become fluid, a flow of identity that converges under the sign of the virtual environment. As such, this article purports itself to define postmodernism and to discuss its application to cyberspace with respect to (1) Baudrillard's hyperreal/real continuum, (2) the fragmentation, fluidity, and decentralization of the self, (3) postmodernism and cyberterrorism, (4) the organizational challenges faced by cybersecurity and law enforcement agents, and (5) the absence of leadership in cyberterrorist networks.","Cyber-security; Cyber-terrorism; Hacking; Networks; Postmodernism",""

Results support the notion that managers from the European Union, Japan, and the United States will be more likely to adopt SMS advertising if they perceive it has the ability to help build the brand.

Through the shared use of the Information Super Highway and the WWW, for example, elder patients can, and indeed are ""visited, diagnosed, treated and managed"" from their homes, with the help of telemedicine systems. These technologies also provide society with additional benefits within a global health perspective, with applications ranging from disease prevention and genetics to surveillance and epidemiologic studies. For example, discoveries relating to the prevention or curing of a disease in one part of the world should be ""known"" everywhere else instantaneously. During an emergency, individuals travelling the world should be able to access their healthcare records for proper care, anywhere. Individuals emigrating from a country to any other should be able to use their information ""seamlessly"" in terms of the ""old"" and ""new"" information systems, no matter where they are. The information contained in multiple systems, i.e., civilian, military forces, etc., should appear transparently among all. However, at this time, significant questions regarding privacy of health information, quality of the services delivered and in general, the information assurance, i.e., authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation persists.

In addition, wider organisational issues such as lack of communication have been associated with computer fraud. In trying to minimise 'opportunities' for computer fraud, this paper argues that managers' awareness and knowledge of how an organisation functions can significantly affect the effectiveness of management information security. This is because managers can send 'cues' to other employees, which influence how the latter perceive and abide by information security and other policies and procedures in their daily activities. Such perception and application are examples of tacit knowledge development and use. In developing the argument, this paper uses the case of Barings Bank together with Mintzberg's five functions of an organisation.

Computing will move from a stand-alone conscious activity to a fully integrated aspect of daily life. Technically, it will move from workstations and laptops connected to networks and servers to embedded computational nodes and wide-spread sensor-based systems. Jeremy Epstein believes that availability of low-cost hardware in future will make feasible information assurance technologies. With the feasible networks of dedicated processors in a single computer of device, computing will see partitioning of applications with well-defined boundaries that will help to gain information assurance.","","Computation theory; Information technology; Laptop computers; Program processors; Ubiquitous computing; Computational nodes; Information assurance; Workstations; Information analysis"

Although, information security standards provide a holistic approach to mitigate these threats and legal acts demand their implementation, companies often refrain from the implementation of information security standards, especially due to high costs and the lack of evidence for a positive cost/benefit ratio. This paper presents a new approach that supports decision makers in interactively defining the optimal set of security controls according to ISO 27001. Therefore, it uses input data from a security ontology that allows the standardized integration of rules which are necessary to model potential countermeasure combinations based on the ISO 27001 standard controls. The approach was implemented into a tool and tested by means of a case study. It not only supports decision makers in defining the controls needed for certification but also provides them with information regarding the efficiency of the chosen controls with regard to multiple definable objectives. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","","Security of data; Corporate strategies; Cost/benefit ratio; Decision makers; Holistic approach; Model potential; Multiple-objectives; Security controls; Security ontologies; Decision making"

Firstly, based on product theorem for the FRFT, the sampling theorems and reconstruction formulas are derived, which explain how to sample a continuous-time signal to obtain its discrete-time version for band limited signals in the fractional Fourier domain. Secondly, the formulas and significance of decimation and interpolation are studied in the fractional Fourier domain. Using the results, the sampling rate conversion theory for the FRFT with a rational fraction as conversion factor is deduced, which illustrates how to sample the discrete-time version without aliasing.

A key challenge for organizations is to understand the economic consequences of security attacks relative to the ISSC portfolio implemented. This paper combines the risk analysis and disaster recovery perspectives to build an integrated simulation model of ISSC portfolio value. The model incorporates the characteristics of an ISSC portfolio relative to the threat and business environments and includes the type of attack, frequency of attacks, possible damage, and the extent and time of recovery from damage.

The proposed algorithm embeds the watermark into a 2D image extracted from the 3D model, rather than directly embedding it into 3D geometry. The proposed embedding domain, i.e., the 2D image, is devised to be robust against the attacks like mesh simplification which severely modifies the vertices and connectivity while preserving the appearance of the model. The watermark-embedded model is obtained by using a simple vertex perturbation algorithm without iterative optimization. Two exemplary watermark applications using the proposed methods are also presented: one is to embed several bits into 3D models and the other is to detect only the existence of a watermark. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is robust against similarity transform, mesh simplification, additive Gaussian noise, quantization of vertex coordinates and mesh smoothing, and that its computational complexity is lower than that of the conventional methods.

The proposed model incorporates three critical factors (feedback structure, time lags, and a flexible saturation point) in a system dynamics (SD) simulation frame. Design/methodology/approach - A simulation model using SD is developed for a dynamic manpower forecasting by decomposing complex processes of manpower planning into a set of feedback loops with a causal-loop diagram. Data gathered from a Korean Government agency were utilized in the simulation for forecasting the manpower demand and supply in the context of the IS industry. Findings - The simulation results showed an overall IS manpower shortage in the IS industry. Policy alternatives were proposed based on the simulation results. The simulation model was rerun to reflect the various alternatives to achieve a stable manpower balance between demand and supply. Originality/value - The research provides insights into the development of effective manpower planning at the industry level (macro level), and policies to increase its efficiency and effectiveness.

But these methods can't meet the various security requirements. Therefore, experts appeal to solve the problems from the inner. Under this background, TCG proposed the conception of trusted computing. It aims to improve the security on the terminals. At present, trusted computing and its related researches are the focus and trend of information security in inland and oversea. Trusted computing is the foundation of the security, and it may solve the insecure problem caused by the platform of hardware in PC. Trust chain starts from the trust root. TCG introduces the idea of the trusted into the computing environment, but there is still not the formalized uniform description. Trusted computing is still a technology but not a theory, and the basic theory model has not been established. Noninterference theory is introduced into the domain of trusted computing to construct the trusted chain theoretic model. The basic theory of the computing trusted is proposed and a noninterference-based trusted chain model is built from the dynamic point of view, and then the model is formalized and verified. Finally, the process of start up based on Linux operating system kernel is implemented. The implementation provides a good reference for the development and application of the trusted computing theory as well.","Noninterference theory; Strusted computing; Trusted chain; Trusted computing platform; Trusted root","Computer operating systems; Computer systems; Computer viruses; Dynamic models; Health; Information services; Intrusion detection; Weight control; (e ,2e) theory; (e ,3e) process; (OTDR) technology; Anti-virus (AV); Basic theory; chain models; Computing environments; Information security; information security systems; Linux operating system; Security requirements; Start ups; Terminals (airport); Trusted computing (TC); Computation theory"

An important problem within this context from a vendor's perspective is to determine how to release patches to fix vulnerabilities in its software. From a firm's perspective, the issue is how to update vulnerable systems with available patches. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model to study the strategic interaction between a vendor and a firm in balancing the costs and benefits of patch management. Our objective is to examine the consequences of time-driven release and update policies. We first study a centralized system in a benchmark scenario to find the socially optimal time-driven patch management. We show that the social loss is minimized when patch-release and update cycles are synchronized. Next, we consider a decentralized system in which the vendor determines its patch-release policy and the firm selects its patch-update policy in a Stackelberg framework, assuming that release and update policies are either time driven or event driven. We develop a sufficient condition that guarantees that a time-driven release by the vendor and a time-driven update by the firm is the equilibrium outcome for patch management. However, in this equilibrium, the patch-update cycle of the firm may not be synchronized with the patch-release cycle of the vendor, making it impossible to achieve the socially optimal patch management in the decentralized system. Therefore, we next examine cost sharing and liability as possible coordination mechanisms. Our analysis shows that cost sharing itself may achieve synchronization and social optimality. However, liability by itself cannot achieve social optimality unless patch-release and update cycles are already synchronized without introducing any liability. Our results also demonstrate that cost sharing and liability neither complement nor substitute each other. Finally, we show that an incentive-compatible contract on cost sharing can be designed to achieve coordination in case of information asymmetry. © 2008 INFORMS.","Coordination schemes; Cost sharing; Information technology security; Liability; Patch management","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Industrial management; Information technology; Security of data; Coordination schemes; Cost sharing; Information technology security; Liability; Patch management; Cost benefit analysis"

At the detection stage, the probabilities that the Markov chain model supports the system call sequences generated by the program are computed. A low probability indicates an anomalous sequence that may result from intrusive activities. Then a decision rule based on the number of anomalous sequences in a locality frame is adopted to classify the program's behavior. The method gives attention to both computational efficiency and detection accuracy, and is especially suitable for on-line detection.

As technology progresses, students face increasing attacks on their information systems. Rather than educate students solely in the classroom, we implemented two experiences to increase student understanding of modern information assurance using the students themselves: the student information security officers (SISOs) and the Carronade exercise. The student information security officer program empowers students to address information assurance education of their fellow students. Students are organized into groups of approximately 120 and each group is assigned a SISO. The SISOs are organized in a hierarchy so that ultimately one SISO is responsible for all. The SISOs educate and mentor their students on safe computing through formal classes in their dorms, formal inspections of personal computers, security awareness exercises, and assisting students when they encounter a problem. The empowerment of students to operationally lead their student organization has resulted in marked improvements in student learning regarding information assurance and computer attacks. An indicator of this learning is the Carronade exercise. The Carronade exercise is an immersive information security awareness exercise conducted very semester since September 2003. SISOs launch the exercise using an automated phishing tool that generates a phishing email attack against every student under the control of the SISO. If a student succumbs to the attack, the SISO is informed of the identity of student. No personal information is transmitted. The SISO then has an opportunity to mentor the student and explain why the email was a phishing attack and what the telltale signs were that identified the email as an attack. Because the attack occurs in the normal work environment of the students, it is viewed as highly relevant to the students. Due to the low threat and personal mentoring approach employed to resolve mistakes, students are receptive to the exercise. This has led to a marked improvement in student performance against phishing attacks over the last three years. The empowering of students to teach and mentor their fellow students through the SISO and Carronade programs has proven to be very successful. © 2011 National Association of Social Workers.","","Computer crime; Electronic mail; Human engineering; Information dissemination; Personal computers; Security of data; Teaching; Computer attacks; Immersive; Information assurance; Information assurance education; Information security awareness; Personal information; Personal mentoring; Phishing; Phishing attacks; Security awareness; Student learning; Student performance; Technology progress; Work environments; Students"

Unfortunately, there is no agreed-upon policy for their disclosure. Disclosure policy (which sets a protected period given to a vendor to release the patch for the vulnerability) indirectly affects the speed and quality of the patch that a vendor develops. Thus, CERT/CC and similar bodies acting in the public interest can use disclosure to influence the behavior of vendors and reduce social cost. This paper develops a framework to analyze the optimal timing of disclosure. We formulate a model involving a social planner who sets the disclosure policy and a vendor who decides on the patch release. We show that the vendor typically releases the patch less expeditiously than is socially optimal. The social planner optimally shrinks the protected period to push the vendor to deliver the patch more quickly, and sometimes the patch release time coincides with disclosure. We extend the model to allow the proportion of users implementing patches to depend upon the quality (chosen by the vendor) of the patch. We show that a longer protected period does not always result in a better patch quality. Another extension allows for some fraction of users to use ""work-arounds. "" We show that the possibility of work-arounds can provide the social planner with more leverage, and hence the social planner shrinks the protected period. Interestingly, the possibility of work-arounds can sometimes increase the social cost due to the negative externalities imposed by the users who are able to use the work-arounds on the users who are not. © 2008 INFORMS.","Disclosure policy; Economics of cybersecurity; Instant disclosure; Patch quality; Patching; Software vulnerability","Economics; Optimization; Disclosure policy; Instant disclosure; Patch quality; Patching; Software vulnerability; Computer software selection and evaluation"

An integrated view is not in place yet, despite that related studies have existed in disparate pieces and keep on emerging. This paper seeks an essential paradigm shift to design/management for security (DMfSec) within the context of supply chain management. The first part is devoted to defining a new discipline of security centric supply chain management (SecSCM). We identify its fundamental tasks and requirements aided by a metaphor borrowed from information security. The second part is a discussion of a potential technical roadmap. Vital and integral to this initiative, we firstly propose the referential taxonomy that systematically accounts for security constraints, requirements, instruments and management, and investigate its relationship to underlying supply chain constructs. Secondly, with the taxonomy in hand, we present modeling issues based on dependency representation and probabilistic analysis, which are suitable for security management. Lastly we consider key tasks in DMfSec and SecSCM. With an emphasis on elaboration of challenges and requirements and employing a process and system oriented perspective, this paper intends to start rather than conclude an adventure into this vast interdisciplinary field.","Design/management for security (DMfSec); Security centric supply chain management (SecSCM); Security management (SecM); Supply chain management (SCM)","Constraint theory; Information management; Security of data; Supply chains; Design/management for security (DMfSec); Security centric supply chain management (SecSCM); Security constraints; Security management (SecM); Supply chain management"

This change has brought with it many challenges in information security. This research seeks to propose a practical application, the capability maturity model (CMM), to meet the needs of medical information security practice. Design/methodology/approach - This paper builds on previous work by the author using the Tactical Information Governance for Security model developed for the medical setting. An essential element of this model is the ability to assess current capability of a practice to meet the needs of security and to identify how improvements can be made. Existing CMM models are reviewed to inform construction of an operational framework for capability assessment. Findings - An operational capability framework for assessing security capability in medical practice, based on CMM principles, is presented. An example of the use of this framework is modelled using backup to provide proof of concept. Practical implications - In an environment that is reliant on doctors and non-technical staff to implement security, an operational framework to improve practice though capability evaluation is needed. The framework presents activities in simple, non-technical terms and separates these activities into discrete sections resulting in improvement that can be easily managed and implemented. Originality/value - The operational framework developed demonstrates how practical security practice improvement can be achieved in a medical environment, whilst meeting strategic objectives, best practice and external validation.

It consists of left mapping and right mapping, and can encrypt images by processing image stretch-and-fold. For left mapping, firstly, each pixel of the first column of a square image was inserted into adjacent two pixels of the first row one by one. Then the second column was inserted into adjacent two pixels of the second row. By repeating the process for the rest of the image, the image was stretched to a line of pixels. Finally the line was fold over to a new square image which size is the same as the plain image. The right map is symmetric to the left mapping. The two-dimensional mapping shuffles the positions of image pixels which are invertible. This paper formulates the algorithm of the mapping, designs a method of key generation and analyses the security of the proposed image encryption. The simulation shows that the image encryption has rapid speeds, high security, no message loss and it is suitable for hardware/software realization.","Chaos; Image encryption; Two-dimensional chaotic map","Algorithms; Chaos theory; Computer simulation; Cryptography; Chaotic map; Image encryption; Information security; Security of data"

Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is ported from the discipline of Macroeconomics, and applied to the information security and privacy domain. The methodology adopted is the so-called ""cross methodology"" which claims ownership of the well-known supply/demand market equilibrium exercise. Findings - Early evaluation reveals that this is a potentially very effective tool in understanding societal behaviour and position towards information security and privacy and therefore makes this a suitable tool for investigating and exploring scenarios that can assist in policy making. Originality/value - Up to date, research on the economics of security and privacy has been primarily focusing on a micro level. The main contribution of this paper is a methodology for investigating privacy and security on a macro level. We believe that our approach in undertaking this research is new and looking at the issues and relationships between security and privacy at a macro level, gives a better understanding of the problems at hand and how to resolve them. Practical implications - The proposed tool may increase the efficiency of policy making and planning as it enables the policy makers on a governmental and strategic level to run scenarios in order to investigate the effect of their decisions (for example, an introduction of a stricter law relating to computer misuse) to the delicate balance of security and privacy.","Business policy; Data security; Privacy","Data privacy; Decision making; Economics; Information management; Planning; Security of data; Business policy; Macroeconomics; Policy making; Public policy"

This part of the research could be successfully combined with the considered qualitative research in acquisition, elicitation, and discovery of logic-based rules and patterns. The paper introduces a synthetic metamethod (SMM), which is aimed to support different types of creative processes. SMM is applicable in quite different fields of computational discovery, knowledge discovery and data mining, information security, number theory, and computer science but the paper focuses on its applications in intelligent systems. Previous research shows that the main part of the considered set of methods is domain independent and is applicable to a wide range of inconsistency tests, conflict resolution, detection or identification, and in fuzzy perceptions approval. Also, it can be used for elimination of weak analogical or other hypotheses or during application of creative processes concerning different types of intelligent systems. The metamethod SMM is based on the analysis of incoming knowledge: beliefs, probabilistic estimations, hypotheses, perceptions, etc., and a successive check with the existing knowledge. The main methods proposed-SMM, INCONSISTENCY, FUNNEL, and CROSSWORD-interact on a competitive principle. The convergence of the obtained results by its character is close to the one from the group of the data-mining methods. The operation is not quite autonomous; it is evolutionary by nature, and admits a kind of ""course change"" after the human intervention that can be realized at any time. On the other hand, one of the basic goals of the presented results is to prompt the user about possible nontrivial decisions. It may be considered as a new kind of human-machine-brainstorming methods.

This limitation is especially significant within the human behavior representation area where areas such as cultural effects research and joint command team behavior modeling require the participation of various cultural and national representatives. To address this limitation, as well as other human behavior representation research issues, NATO Research and Technology Organization initiated a project to develop a NATO virtual institute that enables more effective and more collaborative research into human behavior representation. However, in building and operating a virtual institute one of the chief concerns must be the cyber security of the institute. Because the institute ""exists"" in cyberspace, all of its activities are susceptible to cyberattacks, subterfuge, denial of service and all of the vulnerabilities that networked computers must face. In our opinion, for the concept of virtual institutes to be successful and useful, their operations and services must be protected from the threats in the cyber environment. A key to developing the required protection is the development and promulgation of standards for cyber security. In this paper, we discuss the types of cyber standards that are required, how new internet technologies can be exploited and can benefit the promulgation, development, maintenance, and robustness of the standards. This paper is organized as follows. Section One introduces the concept of the virtual institutes, the expected benefits, and the motivation for our research and for research in this area. Section Two presents background material and a discussion of topics related to VIs, uman behavior and cultural modeling, and network-centric warfare. Section Three contains a discussion of the security challenges that face the virtual institute and the characteristics of the standards that must be employed.

When we consider an asynchronous multi-party network with open communications and an adversary that can adaptively corrupt as many parties as it wishes, we present a new approach to solve the problem of concurrent deniable authentication within the framework of universally composable (UC) security. We formulate a definition of an ideal functionality for deniable authentication. Our constructions rely on a modification of the verifiably smooth projective hashing (VSPH) with projection key function by trapdoor commitment. Our protocols are forward deniable and UC security against adaptive adversaries in the common reference string model. A new approach implies that security is preserved under concurrent composition of an unbounded number of protocol executions; it implies non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols and more. The novelty of our schemes is the use of witness indistinguishable protocols and the security is based on the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption. This new approach is practically relevant as it leads to more efficient protocols and security reductions. © 2008 Science in China Press.","Concurrent deniable authentication; Information security; The decisional composite residuosity assumption; Universally composable; Verifiably smooth projective hashing",""

In this correspondence, we propose an intrusion detection algorithm based on the AdaBoost algorithm. In the algorithm, decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. By combining the weak classifiers for continuous features and the weak classifiers for categorical features into a strong classifier, the relations between these two different types of features are handled naturally, without any forced conversions between continuous and categorical features.

The substation communication system is classified into six basic models to construct vulnerability state graph (VSG). The vulnerability of single action is defined based on the exponential distribution function including parameters called vulnerability factor and equivalent attacking cost, and then the vulnerability values of target systems are calculated by four connection models of VSG. Furthermore, in consideration of the characteristics of SAS information security, a vulnerability factor quantitative method based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technique of order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is designed. An evaluation example, which is constructed by IEC 61850 standard, shows that the proposed method is applicable to evaluating the vulnerability of network-based SAS.","Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Communication system; Information security; Substation automation; Vulnerability state graph (VSG)","Analytic hierarchy process; Communication systems; Computer science; Distribution functions; Security of data; Four connection models; Information security; Substation automation system (SAS); Vulnerability factor; Vulnerability state graph (VSG); Electric substations"

With orthogonal functions having zero cross-correlation between them, the encrypted information remains unaffected. Each encryption and multiplexing process can accommodate two information signals for a single code and hence for a single storage cell or transmission channel. The same process can be performed in multiple steps to increase the multiplexing capability of the system. The proposed security system can enhance the storage capacity and/or maximize the utilization of the available transmission bandwidth.

To achieve effective education, learning security principles must be grounded in experience. This calls for effective laboratory exercises (or course projects). Although a number of laboratories have been designed for security education, they only cover a small portion of the fundamental security principles. Moreover, their underlying lab environments are different, making integration of these laboratories infeasible for a semester-long course. Currently, security laboratories that can be widely adopted are still lacking, and they are in great demand in security education.

The SEED environment consists of Minix, an instructional operating system (OS), and Linux, a production OS; it takes advantage of the simplicity of Minix and the completeness of Linux, and provides a unified platform to support a rich set of laboratories for computer security education. Based on the SEED environment, we have developed a list of laboratories that cover a wide spectrum of security principles.

However, it also has above mentioned flaw. Moreover, we further found that there were some extra security drawbacks in their protocol. First, the bidder can forge a bidding receipt to claim that he/she is a valid auction winner. Second, it may suffer from the third party forging attack. Third, their protocol leaked some bidders' private information to the third party, such as the bidder's bank account number and the authorization code.

A comprehensive experiment for testing the feasibility of detecting unknown computer worms, employing several computer configurations, background applications, and user activity, was performed. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored by an agent that was developed. Four feature selection methods were used to reduce the number of features and four learning algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets.

This paper investigates the factors that affect consumer acceptance of RFID technology.

The research model proposes that convenience, culture, privacy, regulation, and security are the principal factors influencing the consumers'acceptance of RFID. However, the results show that convenience, culture, and security are significant predictors. This study is the first in the RFID literature to use the TAM for explaining consumer acceptance of RFID technology.

Further, several areas of research were identified in the course of the literature survey where more study is warranted. These avenues for future research are also discussed in this paper. Several types of grid systems exist currently, and the security needs and solutions to address those needs for each type vary as much as the types of systems themselves.

In case of security systems, it is obvious that some experiments are to be performed in the environment which is very similar to the real Internet environment. But. there are many problems for providing such environment. Particularly, it is more difficult in the case of the background traffic because many connections are required continuously and various types of services and data are needed to send or receive for the maintenance. For this reason, in this paper, we propose the system which produces a great number of background traffic. It constructs the environment like the real Internet and generates a large amount of harmful traffic.

These are formulated based on the roles of the individuals, and the projects and departments they belong to.

There are many aspects of multimedia and sensor security ranging from trust in multimedia and sensor networks; security in ubiquitous databases, middleware, and multi-domain systems; privacy in ubiquitous environment and sensor networks; and radio frequency identification security. Particularly interesting are multimedia information security, forensics, image watermarking, and steganography. There are different reasons for using security in multimedia and sensors that depend on the method of access, the type of accessed information, the information placement and the availability of copying, sensitivity of protected information, and potential ways for corruption of data and their transmission. Protection of image and data includes watermarking, steganography, and forensics. Multi-domain systems, middleware, and databases are used for both local and distributed protections. Sensor networks often use radio frequency identification tags for identification. Both trusted hardware and software are needed to maintain multimedia and sensor security. Different applications require various levels of security often embedded in the multimedia image. In addition, a certain security level is needed for transmission of the application. Sensors use different security for data gathering depending on the type of data collected. Secure transmission is needed for sensor data.

Building on these previous efforts, the purpose of this study is to put forth a framework for ISM.

Findings - The empirical analysis suggests: four factors (information integrity, confidentiality, accountability, and availability) serve as critical information security objectives; most of the security areas and items covered under ISO 17799 are valid with one new area - ""external"" or ""inter-organizational information security""; and for moderately information-sensitive organizations, ""confidentiality"" has the highest correlation with ISM practices; for highly information-sensitive organizations, ""confidentiality"", ""accountability"", and ""integrity"" are the major ISM objectives. The most important contributor to information security objectives is ""access control"". Research limitations/implications - This study contributes to the domain of information security research by developing a parsimonious set of security objectives and practices grounded in the findings of previous works in academia and practical literature. Practical implications - These findings provide insights for business managers and information security professionals attempting to implement ISM programs within their respective organizational settings.

Challenges are to determine which of these technologies make sense, and which can be affordably integrated to achieve desired improvements in mission effectiveness. This paper presents an approach to address these challenges including a detailed analysis on compliance with selected elements of the government's Net Ready Key Performance Parameter (NR-KPP). The discussion will include: (a) Sources of requirements, (b) Technical approach, and (c) Compliance with the NR-KPP. Concepts are applicable to all tactical platforms, but examples in this paper will be on rotorcraft applications. Sources of requirements include military strategy documents, platform upgrade plans, and discussions with operational users. In addition, the Department of Defense provides requirements guidance on interoperability in the Global Information Grid. A System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) method will be presented. The technical approach involves application independence from communication equipment, middleware, and network processing hardware. Technologies to achieve this approach will also be discussed, and they include heterogeneous networking, advanced interoperable middleware, and applications of emerging network processing standards. The principal requirement for net-enabled tactical platforms is the NR-KPP, which contains four major areas of compliance: (a) Integrated architecture products, (b) Key Interface Profiles, (c) Information Assurance, and (d) Network Centric Operations and Warfare Reference Model (NCOW-RM). This paper contains a short discussion on these four areas of compliance.

More recently, similar attacks have been extended to the widely used SHA-1, to such an extent that nowadays is prudent to switch to schemes such as SHA-256 and Whirlpool. Nevertheless, many cryptographers believe that all the SHA-related schemes could be vulnerable to variants of the same attacks, for all these schemes have been largely influenced by the design of the MD4 hash function. In this paper, we present a general framework for the automated design of cryptographic block ciphers and hash functions by using Genetic Programming. After a characterization of the search space and the fitness function, we evolve highlys nonlinear and extremely efficient functions that can be used as the core components of a cryptographic construction. As an example, a new block cipher named Wheedham is proposed. Following the Miyaguchi-Preneel construction, this block cipher is then used as the compression function of a new hash scheme producing digests of 512 bits. We present a security analysis of our proposal and a comparison in terms of performance with the most promising alternatives in the near future: SHA-512 and Whirlpool. The results show that automatically-obtained schemes such as those presented are competitive both in security and speed.","Block cipher; Cryptography and coding; Evolutionary computation; Hash function; Information security; Non-linear functions","Computer programming; Function evaluation; Functions; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Probability density function; Programming theory; Systems analysis; Block cipher; Evolutionary computation; Hash function; Information security; Non-linear functions; Cryptography"

The model transforms the risks of information by opportunity cost, measures the efficiency of security related tools and policies by impact factor, and then gets the optimal investment strategy with several selectable constrains.

While some virtualisation experts claim that virtualised computing environments are fundamentally no less secure than physical computing environments, others claim that virtualisation can enable better security. Both claims can be correct, but only where the management of the physical machine is secure and the configuration of each virtual machine is secured in a standardised fashion. However, the reality is that when information security controls are improperly implemented or neglected in virtualised environments, real security risks and exposures are created faster than ever. This is the potential dark side of virtualisation, where the information security controls that adequately controlled risks before virtualisation may no longer suffice. The good news is that it doesn't have to be this way. Gene Kim of Tripwire explains why. For better or worse, virtualisation is here. Tripwire's survey of 219 IT organisations revealed that 85% were already using virtualisation, and half of the remaining 15% were planning to. VMware has stated that 85% of customers are already using virtualisation for mission-critical production services. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Integration of business processes across disparate organizations with different cultures requires careful planning and involves process automation, globalization, system selection, downsizing, and information security. It is important to streamline and automate processes in order to improve efficiency and reduce operating cycle times. Ideally, during reengineering, processes should be built from scratch based on evolving business needs, changing market conditions, as well as innovations in technology. Business realities, however, often force organizations into redesigning peripheral business processes while keeping the core process intact. This helps avoid disruption of organizational operations and allows for more flexible time constraints during implementation. Several compromises must be made during this redesign. This paper presents a framework for BPR using a structured analytic approach to make business decisions. The paper discusses the case of BPR at General Electric Energy's Wind Division to integrate business operations across its globally dispersed acquisitions. The effort involved defining metrics for redesign, identifying alternate tools and processes, and evaluating the alternatives through those metrics employing Six Sigma methodology. The goal of this work is to demonstrate our approach that abstract best practices for process integration across global engineering corporations developed over time at General Electric. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, online gaming crime has turned out one of the most serious cybercrimes in many countries, such as in Taiwan, South Korea, China, and so on.

It can effectively protect virtual property and strengthen the competence of digital evidence by recording the legal source, ownership, trading track, and handling of virtual properties so as to lower the cases of online gaming crime. The online gaming companies may use it in the aspects of virtual property management, tracing historic records and collecting legal digital evidence, while the existing system mechanism of online game doesn't need to be changed. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Digital evidence; Online gaming; Virtual property; Virtual Property Description Language","Commerce; Computer crime; Digital arithmetic; Error analysis; Food preservation; Industry; Information services; Intersymbol interference; Law enforcement; Laws and legislation; Online systems; Records management; Commerce; Crime; Electronic document exchange; Internet; Online systems; Security of data; Social networking (online); Business opportunities; Description languages; Digital contents; Digital evidence; Existing systems; Network applications; On-line gaming; Virtual properties; business opportunities; content modeling; Cyber-crimes; description languages; Digital contents; Digital evidences; Existing systems; Heidelberg (CO); In order; Information security; international conferences; International workshops; Network applications; On-line games; On-line gaming; Ownership model; Property (S); Property management; Property protection; rapid growth; Real world; Security informatics; security modeling; south korea; Springer (CO); Virtual properties; Computational geometry; Computer crime"

The framework consists of dividing the communication system to be analyzed into its subcomponents and linking these to relevant evaluation criteria. In this study, the information security standard ISO 17799 has been used as a point of reference to define such evaluation criteria. The framework involves collecting data to evaluate each individual criterion and aggregating these evaluations using a robust algorithm. To cater for the many uncertainties in evaluating information security, the evaluation of the individual subcomponents is aggregated using a Dempster-Shafer based algorithm for evidential reasoning. This algorithm incorporates the many insecure facts and incomplete data that are inherent in large scale systems. The overall result is a set of indicators which highlight the level of information security within a studied communication system. The paper is concluded with a description of a case study in which the framework was applied to a communication system used for automatic meter reading (AMR).

Each sensor collects a noise-corrupted version, performs a local quantization, and transmits a 1-bit message to an ally fusion center through a wireless medium where the sensor outputs are vulnerable to unauthorized observation from enemy/third-party fusion centers. In this paper, we introduce an encrypted wireless sensor network (eWSN) concept where stochastic enciphers operating on binary sensor outputs are introduced to disguise the sensor outputs, creating an eWSN scheme. Noting that the plaintext (original) and ciphertext (disguised) messages are constrained to a single bit due to bandwidth constraints, we consider a binary channel-like scheme to probabilistically encipher (i.e., flip) the sensor outputs. We first consider a symmetric key encryption case where the ""0"" and ""1"" enciphering probabilities are equal. The key is represented by the bit enciphering probability. Specifically, we derive the optimal estimator of the deterministic signal approached from a maximum-likelihood perspective and the Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation problem utilizing the key. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the considered cryptosystem on enemy fusion centers that are unaware of the fact that the WSN is encrypted (i.e., we derive the bias, variance, and mean square error (MSE) of the enemy fusion center). We then extend the cryptosystem to admit unequal enciphering schemes for ""0"" and ""1"", and analyze the estimation problem from both the prospectives of ally (that has access to the enciphering keys) and (third-party) enemy fusion centers. The results show that when designed properly, a significant amount of bias and MSE can be introduced to an enemy fusion center with the cost to the ally fusion center being a marginal increase [factor of (1 - Ω1 - Ω0)-2, where 1 - Ωj, j = 0, 1 is the ""j"" enciphering probability] in the estimation variance (compared to the variance of a fusion center estimate operating in a vulnerable WSN). © 2008 IEEE.","Cryptography; Decentralized estimation; Distributed signal processing; Information security; Parameter estimation; Sensor networks","Bandwidth; Message passing; Parameter estimation; Security of data; Wireless sensor networks; Decentralized estimation; Distributed signal processing; Encrypted wireless sensor network (eWSN); Cryptography"

Emphasis on security has become increasingly more common in the last few decades, not only in Information Technology, but across all industries. One of the main principles of security is that a system only be accessed by a legitimate user. According to the ISO 7498/2 document [1] (an international standard which defines an information security system architecture) there are 5 pillars of information security. These are Identification/Authentication, Confidentiality, Authorization, Integrity and Non Repudiation. The very first line of security in a system is identifying and authenticating a user. This ensures that the user is who he/she claims to be, and allows only authorized individuals to access your system. Technologies have been developed that can automatically recognize a person by his unique physical features. This technology, referred to as 'biometrics', allows us to quickly, securely and conveniently identify an individual. Biometrics solutions have already been deployed worldwide, and it is rapidly becoming an acceptable method of identification in the eye of the public. As useful and advanced as unimodal (single biometric sample) biometric technologies are, they have their limits. Some of them aren't completely accurate; others aren't as secure and can be easily bypassed. Recently it has been reported to the congress of the U.S.A [2] that about 2 percent of the population in their country do not have a clear enough fingerprint for biometric use, and therefore cannot use their fingerprints for enrollment or verification. This same report recommends using a biometric system with dual (multimodal) biometric inputs, especially for large scale systems, such as airports.

Its main purpose is to identify potentially intrusive events and alert the security personnel to the danger. A typical intrusion detection system, however, is known to be imperfect in detection of intrusive events, resulting in high false-alarm rates. Nevertheless, current intrusion detection models unreasonably assume that upon alerts raised by a system, an information security officer responds to all alarms without any delay and avoids damages of hostile activities. This assumption of responding to all alarms with no time lag is often impracticable. As a result, the benefit of an intrusion detection system can be overestimated by current intrusion detection models. In this article, we extend previous models by including an information security officer's alarm inspection under a constraint as a part of the process in determining the optimal intrusion detection policy. Given a potentially hostile environment for a firm, in which the intrusion rates and costs associated with intrusion and security officers' inspection can be estimated, we outline a framework to establish the optimal operating points for intrusion detection systems under security officers' inspection constraint. The optimal solution to the model will provide not only a basis of better evaluation of intrusion detection systems but also useful insights into operations of intrusion detection systems. The firm can estimate expected benefits for running intrusion detection systems and establish a basis for increase in security personnel to relax security officers' inspection constraint. © 2008 ACM.","Computer security; Intrusion detection; Optimal inspection rates; Optimal operating points","Alarm systems; Computer crime; Damage detection; Estimation; Industrial economics; Information services; Inspection; Operating costs; Personnel; Security of data; Sensors; Signal detection; Computer security; False-alarm rates; Hostile environments; Information security; Intrusion detection models; Intrusion detection system; Intrusion Detection Systems; Optimal inspection rates; Optimal operating points; Optimal solutions; Resource constraints; Security officers; Security personnel; Security protection; Time lags; Intrusion detection"

One main challenge that these systems have faced has been how to protect private keys from attackers. Recently, biometric cryptosystems have been introduced as a reliable way of concealing private keys by using biometric data. A fuzzy vault refers to a biometric cryptosystem that can be used to effectively protect private keys and to release them only when legitimate users enter their biometric data. In biometric systems, a critical problem is storing biometric templates in a database. However, fuzzy vault systems do not need to directly store these templates since they are combined with private keys by using cryptography. Previous fuzzy vault systems were designed by using fingerprint, face, and so on. However, there has been no attempt to implement a fuzzy vault system that used an iris. In biometric applications, it is widely known that an iris can discriminate between persons better than other biometric modalities. In this paper, we propose a reliable fuzzy vault system based on local iris features. We extracted multiple iris features from multiple local regions in a given iris image, and the exact values of the unordered set were then produced using the clustering method. To align the iris templates with the new input iris data, a shift-matching technique was applied. Experimental results showed that 128-bit private keys were securely and robustly generated by using any given iris data without requiring prealignment. © 2008 IEEE.","Biometric encryption; Fuzzy vault scheme; Independent component analysis; Pattern clustering; Reed-Solomon coding","Algorithms; Biometry; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Iris; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Security Measures; Cryptography; Database systems; Information services; Keys (for locks); Security of data; algorithm; article; automated pattern recognition; biometry; computer assisted diagnosis; fuzzy logic; histology; human; information retrieval; iris; methodology; organization and management; Biometric applications; Biometric cryptosystems; Biometric data; Biometric encryption; Biometric systems; Biometric templates; Clustering methods; Crypto systems; Cryptographic systems; Fuzzy vault; Fuzzy vault scheme; Independent component analysis; Information security; IRIS data; Iris images; Legitimate users; Local regions; Matching techniques; Pattern clustering; Pre-alignment; Private keys; Reed-Solomon coding; Biometrics"

Our model also shows that the investment in information security does not necessarily increase with increasing level of risk aversion of the decision maker. Relationships between vulnerability and investment effectiveness and two broad classes of security breach probability functions are examined, leading to interesting insights that can be used as guidelines for managers to determine the optimal level of security investment for certain types of security threats faced by risk-averse firms.

Ensuring the security of WS-based communication for wind power plants is an unsolved problem. WS-Security is a standard used to deal with the security requirements in applications of web services, while the username/password and X.509 certificates are security tokens most commonly used in electric power utilities. We propose a security mechanism that deals with the requirements of authentication, integrity, nonreputation, and confidentiality across the communication process based on WS-Security and the two security tokens. The security mechanism is implemented by an extension of simple object-access protocol message, design of the security agent, and the related security message-processing algorithm. An instance is modeling based on IEC 61400-25 to demonstrate the security-enhanced remote control of wind power plants.

A CFH-OFDM system is put forward and designed, which is applicable to high speed communication in low-voltage networks. The system introduces the CFH into the coding system of OFDM, which can improve the system performance of anti-jamming and the security of communication system.

It seeks to propose the use of ontologies to tackle the problem. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes the general methodology to create security ontologies and illustrates the case with the design and validation of two ontologies: system vulnerabilities and security incidents. Findings - Two examples of ontologies, one related to systems vulnerability and the other related to security incidents (designed to illustrate this proposal) are described. The portability/ reusability propriety is demonstrated, inferring that the information structured at lower levels (by security management tools and people) can be successfully used and understood at higher levels (by security governance tools and people). Research limitations/implications - Work in the area of managing privacy policies, risk assessment and mitigation management, as well as CRM, business alignment and business intelligence, could be greatly eased by using an ontology to properly define the concepts involved in the area. Practical implications - Ontologies can facilitate the interoperabilityamong different security tools, creating a unique way to represent security data and allow the security data from any security tool (for instance, Snort) to be mapped into an ontology, such as the security incident one described in the paper. An example showing how the two ontologies could be plugged into a high level decision-making system is described at the end. Originality/value - Although several previous papers examined the value of using ontologies to represent security information, this one looks at their properties for a possible integrated use of management and governance tools.","Data security; Governance; Knowledge management","Computer system recovery; Decision making; Digital signal processing; Industrial management; Information management; Information services; Information theory; Management; Occupational risks; Problem solving; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risks; Safety engineering; Security of data; Tools; (PL) properties; Business Intelligence (BI); Design/methodology/approach; General (CO); information security management; Practical implications; Privacy policies; Security data; Security governance; Security incidents; Security management; Security tools; Ontology"

Despite widespread effort devoted to combating malware, current techniques have proven to be insufficient in stemming the incessant growth in malware attacks. In this paper, we describe a tool that exploits a combination of virtualized (isolated) execution environments and dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) to detect malicious software and prevent its execution. We define two isolated environments: (i) a Testing environment, wherein an untrusted program is traced during execution using DBI and subjected to rigorous checks against extensive security policies that express behavioral patterns of malicious software, and (ii) a Real environment, wherein a program is subjected to run-time monitoring using a behavioral model (in place of the security policies), along with a continuous learning process, in order to prevent non-permissible behavior. We have evaluated the proposed methodology on both Linux and Windows XP operating systems, using several virus benchmarks as well as obfuscated versions thereof. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves almost complete coverage for original and obfuscated viruses. Average execution times go up to 28.57X and 1.23X in the Testing and Real environments, respectively. The high overhead imposed in the Testing environment does not create a severe impediment since it occurs only once and is transparent to the user. Users are only affected by the overhead imposed in the Real environment. We believe that our approach has the potential to improve on the state-of-the-art in malware detection, offering improved accuracy with low performance penalty. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Control-data flow; Dynamic binary instrumentation; Execution context; Malware; Virtualization","Binary sequences; Computer operating systems; Computer software; Information services; Instruments; Process engineering; Security of data; Security systems; Software testing; Viruses; Behavioral modeling; Behavioral patterns; Continuous learning; Control-data flow; Current techniques; Dynamic binary instrumentation; Execution context; Execution environments; Execution times; Information security; International conferences; Malicious software; Malware; Malware attacks; Malware detection; Operating systems; Real environments; Run-time monitoring; Security policies; Testing environment; Virtualization; Vulnerability assessments; Windows XP; Computer crime"

It has high autonomy and mobility, that is, it can move unbridled in different execution environments and automatically detect its current environment and respond accordingly. The above qualities make the mobile agent very suitable for use in e-commerce. Transfer of confidential information over the Internet is always risky. A mobile agent may be tampered with by a malicious host, or confidential information carried by the mobile agent could be stolen by other agents. Thus, it is essential that a mobile agent is equipped with security measures to guard against these attacks. This paper proposes a security scheme for mobile agents. The scheme includes access control and key management to ensure the security and confidentiality of information and the system. After examining the access control and key management scheme for mobile agents proposed by Volker and Mehrdad, the proposed scheme applies the concepts of polynomial interpolation formula, hierarchy structure, and the superkey to improve Volker and Mehrdad's schemes which needed a large amount of space for the mobile agent. A security and performance analysis proves the proposed scheme can effectively protect the mobile agents.","Access control; Information security; Key management; Mobile agent; Polynomial interpolation formula",""

The current state of affairs for the vulnerability and threat management functions are in dire need of a solution that can rapidly assess systems for vulnerabilities and fix them expeditiously. This will guarantee the effective reconnaissance of critical vulnerabilities in a more concise and cohesive fashion throughout all industries affected by the inherent risk in systems and applications, This will also help defend against super-fast worms and other malicious mobile code that can blaze through an organization's network leaving a path of compromised systems and reduced availability. The top-down centralized model for vulnerability assessment and remediation has proven inefficient and riddled with multiple vulnerabilities itself; the irony is befuddling. In this paper, we propose a framework to enhance an organization's information security posture by distributedly assessing and remedying system vulnerabilities. By creating and utilizing the proposed framework, we can ensure more vigilance, a progressive and reactive implementation of a patch-management and worm defense strategy, and increased efficiency in the distribution of updates. Malicious mobile code, specifically worms, are very efficient in their distribution, this is because they are able to infect other systems in a peer-to-peer distributed fashion. By utilizing a similar approach to vulnerability assessment and patch management we can ensure a higher coverage and redundancy for all systems within and organization. The framework proposed in this paper is timely since most peer-topeer distribution models focus more on content delivery and resource re-allocation.","","Codes (standards); Codes (symbols); Environmental engineering; Information services; Compromised systems; Content delivery; Current state; Distribution models; Information security; International conferences; Malicious mobile code; Patch management; Peer-to-Peer; Resource re-allocation; Security vulnerabilities; Threat management; Top-down; Vulnerability assessments; Worm defense; Risk assessment"

Studies of information security contravention behaviors have focused on some aspects of security lapses and have provided some behavioral recommendations such as punishment of offenders or ethics training. While this research has provided some insight on information security contravention, they leave incomplete our understanding of the omission of information security measures among people who know how to protect their systems but fail to do so.

The result suggests that perceived self-efficacy in using virus protection measures, perceived response efficacy of virus protective measures, positive outcome expectations of virus protection measures, perceived vulnerability to virus threats and prior virus infection experiences were the most important predictors of the intention to adopt virus protection behaviour.

During the last few decades, companies have reengineered business processes on the back of digital data and computer networks. Recently, companies are beginning to realize that increased accessibility, and productivity, carries a hidden cost of making the data more vulnerable to security breaches. It makes intuitive sense to incorporate information security into strategic decision-making during business process reengineering. However, the intricate and complex nature of information security obscures the return on security investment, making companies reluctant to invest in security policies or technology. Consequentially, companies are often forced to suboptimally retrofit security into their business processes in response to security breaches. The case study presents an information security risk analysis proactively conducted at General Electric Energy's Wind Division after the business process reengineering of their product data storage and sharing process.

Two important challenges in such a context are represented by secure information transmission among the collaborating parties and selective differentiated access to data among members of collaborating groups. Addressing such challenges requires, among other things, developing techniques for Secure Group Communication (SGC), Secure Dynamic Conferencing (SDC), Differential Access Control (DIF-AC), and Hierarchical Access Control (HAC). Cryptography and key management have been intensively investigated and widely applied in order to secure information. However, there is a lack of key management mechanisms which are general and flexible enough to address all requirements arising from information transmission and data access. This paper proposes the first holistic group key management scheme which can directly support all these functions yet retain efficiency. The proposed scheme is based on the innovative concept of Access Control Polynomial (ACP) that can efficiently and effectively support full dynamics, flexible access control with fine-tuned granularity, and anonymity. The new scheme is immune from various attacks from both external and internal malicious parties.","Access control; Cryptography; Information security; Key management; Secure group communication; Trusted Collaborative Computing (TCC)","Communication; Computer networks; Cryptography; Distributed computer systems; Management; Mechanisms; Mobile telecommunication systems; Security systems; Infocom; Information security; Key management; Secure group communication; Trusted Collaborative Computing (TCC); Access control"

This fact is one of information leakage threats in information security. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and prevent the information leakage caused by the unexpected electromagnetic noise. In this paper, we propose a measurement method of the information signal, which is contained in electromagnetic noisefrom a personal computer The information signal is correlated with the RGB signal constructing a display image, because it can reconstruct the similar image to the display image. In order to detect the information signal, we displayed a vertical stripes pattern with a specific periodicity on the monitor as a test image. Then the RGB signal constructing the test image has the specific frequency component, so the information signal has also the same frequency component. Thus the information signal can be defined as the periodical signal frequency of the vertical stripes pattern. By means of this definition, the information signal can be detected and measured in the electromagnetic noise. This measurement method is possible to evaluate quantitatively the information signal leaking through the electromagnetic noise. In order to check the validity of our proposed method, test experiments were carried out. These results showed the correspondence with the reconstructed images and the measured levels. © 2008 IEEE.","Display image; Electromagnetic noise; Information leakage; Information security; Personal computer","Computer networks; Computer systems; Electromagnetism; Information services; Instruments; Measurement theory; Personal computers; Signal processing; Display image; Electromagnetic noise; Information leakage; Information security; Personal computer; Computational methods"

Among several established methods, a double-random phase encryption technique (DRPE) for encoding a primary image into stationary white noise was developed by using the analogy between Fresnel diffraction patterns and the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT-DRPE). In this case, additional keys are obtained through the knowledge of the fractional orders of the FrFTs. In this work we propose an encoding setup for time-varying signals, mainly for short-haul fiber optics link applications, that can be considered as the temporal analogue of the spatial FrFT-DRPE. The behavior of the proposed method is analyzed by employing the Wigner distribution function. As a result, general expressions for both signal time width and spectral bandwidth, at all encryption stages are obtained. Numerical simulations have been carried out to illustrate the system performance. The obtained results indicate that this encryption method could be a good alternative to other well-established methods. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional business process management provides concepts for the economical optimization of processes, while risk management focuses on the design of robust business processes. While aiming at the same goal, namely the improvement of business, the approaches how to reach this vary, due to a different understanding of improvement. Following this, optimizing recommendations of business process management and risk management may be contradictory. Therefore, we proposed a unified method, integrating both points of views to enable risk-aware business process management and optimization. In this paper, we briefly describe the ROPE (Risk-Oriented Process Evaluation) methodology and the Security Ontology concept, which provides a solid knowledge base for an applicable and holistic company specific IT security approach. This heavy-weight ontology provides structured knowledge regarding the relations between threats, safeguards, and assets, which are crucial for modeling processes in ROPE. We show how the integration of the Security Ontology's knowledge base enhances the applicability of the ROPE methodology leading to improved risk-aware business process management. © 2008 IEEE.","","Computer networks; Enterprise resource management; Information services; Integration; Knowledge based systems; Management; Ontology; Optimization; Risk analysis; Risk management; Rope; Business process management; Process engineering"

However, there exist some transaction risks while enabling agents make purchase decisions and exploit information to other unknown agents in the virtual markets. Trust and reputation are widely introduced to mitigate this risk by deriving the trustworthiness of certain agent from his transaction history. Despite existing of some proposed reputation-based trust models addressing the above issue, most of them can not readily be used since there are many unforseen changes in the electronic markets. To this end, this paper proposes a novel reputation computing model that integrates a direct reputation and a recommended reputation. Specially, we present a three-factor method to evaluate the direct reputation from personal self-experience, and adopt the vector similarity to evaluate the recommendation credibility that can effectively detect the dishonest recommendations. In addition, we amend the short term reputation and penalty factor metric to make our mechanism effective in detecting malicious agents with strategic behavior.

For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite-state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space-efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds. © 2008 IEEE.","","Chlorine compounds; Computer crime; Information services; Internet; Intrusion detection; Nanostructured materials; Robots; Security of data; Sensors; Translation (languages); Finite state automaton; Information security; Network intrusion detection systems; NIDS signatures; Security and privacy; Signature matching; Space complexities; Succinct representation; System calls; Test sets; Time complexities; Finite automata"

This research presents a system which we call IDEA; the Intrusion DEtection Automata system. We utilize a third source of data for intrusion detection in the form of an instrumented process. Open source software is recompiled using a modified compiler we have created, and the resulting executable program generates the data as it runs.

However, the crypto-graphic method brings in some problems such as inefficiency and malfunctioning, especially impossibility of arithmetic. The previous works in this area have been proved insecure or can provide only a few or several SQL queries. Actually, there is no scheme which can support secure all kinds of SQL queries and arithmetic. We propose a novel scheme to solve this problem. We do not encrypt every data itself but permute all the data within each attribute so that we can break the relation of the data and the owner. Accordingly, the proposed scheme guarantees intractability of re-identification for data-owners' privacy and at the same time enables the miner to get the information he wants. © 2008 IEEE.","","Digital arithmetic; Graphic methods; Helium; Information security; International conferences; SQL queries; Information services"

Each node in the autonomous system computes shortest paths and creates destination tables used to route data to next node on the path to its destination. Shortest paths are selected according to path cost. Path cost is determined by sum of its weight links. Then link weights determine the shortest paths, in which turn determine the routing of network traffic flow. OSPF weights setting problem is to find a set of OSPF weights that optimizes network performance. OSPF weights setting problem is an NP-hard problem.

We argue that it is necessary to examine the information security cultures1 of various professions to identify differences that may exist, so that they may be taken into account in formulating initiatives to enhance information security. In this article, we provide a comparative description of the security cultures of four professions - information systems, accounting, marketing and human resources - based on semistructured interviews of respondents from each of the professions. Our results confirm the existence of differences in security cultures across professions. In particular, they indicate that there are differences in beliefs about what constitutes information security, who is responsible for it, and the likelihood of their compliance with security under performance pressure. © 2008 IEEE.","","Information security; System sciences; Information services"

Among them, the use of the mobile agent in e-commerce is a highly potential technology which has accumulated a lot of interests in recent years. Since the mobile agent has high autonomy and mobility, it can move, unbridled, in different execution environments. At the same time, it can automatically detect its current environment and respond accordingly. Finally, it can also carry out work, or tasks assigned to it by its user. The above qualities make the mobile agent very suitable for use in e-commerce. The internet is an open environment. When there is a need to transfer, or exchange confidential information over the internet, the security of the present Internet environment must be improved. Even so, during its execution, a mobile agent needs to roam around the internet between different servers on the internet. At the same time, a mobile agent may also come in contact, or interact with other mobile agents or hosts. Therefore, the users may worry that a mobile agent may not work properly if it meets with a malicious program, or if it is tampered with by a malicious host, or that confidential information carried by the mobile agent may be stolen by other agents. To ensure the safety of mobile agents on the internet, this paper proposes a security scheme suitable for use to mobile agents: The scheme includes access control and key management to ensure the security and confidentiality of information and the system. In view of the access control and key management scheme for mobile agents proposed by Volker and Mehrdad[l], this paper proposes a new scheme that uses the concepts of polynomial interpolation formula[19], the hierarchy structure and the superkey[8] to improve the previous security schemes which need a large amount of space for the mobile agent. According to this paper's security and performance analysis, it is proved that the proposed scheme can efficiently protect the mobile agents. © 2008 IEEE.","Access control; Information security; Key management; Mobile agent; Polynomial interpolation formula","Access control; Agents; Commerce; Electronic commerce; Information management; Internet; Mobile telecommunication systems; Polynomials; Security of data; Security systems; Technology; Confidential information; E-commerce; Execution environments; Hierarchical key management scheme; Hierarchy structures; Information networking; Information security; International conferences; Internet environment; Key management; Malicious hosts; Mobile agent; Performance analyses; Polynomial interpolation; Polynomial interpolation formula; Security schemes; Mobile agents"

TFM is defined as the Fourier transform of the impulse response of an optical fiber, which interconnects each CDMA system. TFM has parameters such as the state of polarization (SOP), phase difference, power distribution between two orthogonal modes over an optical frequency range. We first analyze the statistic of a received signal via an optical fiber with TFM, and then apply the statistic to the BER analysis.

Considering the particularity of network security, a tool DTAD (Dynamic Taint Analysis Detector) for information flow security detection is designed and implemented, aiming at the problem of data security in network access. This tool performs log recording and state controlling for malicious access and virus vulnerability using the state-control characteristic of virtual machines. Defense systems capture network data by executing applications to determine whether these accesses(i.e. target jumping, function address and instruction access) are legitimate or not. Once an attack is detected, the tool records states of the virtual machine at the process level as well as the kernel level. For attacks caused by malicious code, the tool injects its own diagnostic code into the process space of running programs to substitute the malicious code, as a result, related information for the attacked process is collected. The tool is able to generate precise signatures for network intrusion detection by associating and comparing network data recorded in log files with process information collected by the virtual machine, the whole process is finished automatically. The tool can also precisely identify attack types and provide effective protection measures through fast signature releasing. Experiments have validated the efficiency of the tool in attack recognition and information protection, and indicated that this detection and protection system is effective in recognizing, tracking and processing taint data. © 2008 IEEE.","","Access control; Administrative data processing; Codes (standards); Codes (symbols); Computer aided analysis; Computer systems; Data flow analysis; Data processing; Dynamic analysis; Electric breakdown; Health; Information science; Information services; Injection (oil wells); Internet; Intrusion detection; Management information systems; Network security; Program diagnostics; Security of data; Data security; Defense systems; Information flow security; Information leakages; Information protection; Information security; International conferences; Log files; Malicious code; Network access; Network data; Network intrusion detection; Process information; Protection measures; Protection systems; State-control; Virtual machine; Virtual machining; Information management"

The risk prediction module studies the changes of risk and forecasts the future risk with time series model. Risk monitor and security strategy implement dynamic risk management. Risk monitor module monitors the system current risk and its trend. According to the relationship between future risk and risk threshold, it supervises security strategy module to dynamically adjust system security strategy. Security strategy module implements various security strategies and schemas. Simulation results show that the framework is suitable and efficient. © 2008 IEEE.","Multi-perceptive evaluation; Real-time risk management; Time series analysis","Finance; Forecasting; Industrial engineering; Information services; Insurance; Intelligent control; Management; Risk analysis; Risk management; Safety engineering; Time series analysis; Control and automation; Evaluation modeling; Information security; Management frameworks; Multi-perceptive evaluation; Multi-perspective; On time; Real-time risk management; Risk predictions; Risk threshold; Schemas; Security attacks; Security services; Security strategies; Simulation results; System security; Time series modeling; Risk assessment"

We set up the information security game model, and make the Nash Equilibrium analysis. The Nash Equilibrium analysis results of pure strategy and mixed strategy are consistent. By Nash Equilibrium analysis, we get the cost demand for information security investment. If this demand condition is not satisfied, we introduce the penalty parameter to the investment game. By regulating the value of the penalty parameter, we solve the hard problem of information security investment when it is difficult to reduce the investment cost. It is the first time to analyze information security investment by game theory.

This improves the distortion in original image as blocks are remained unchanged and increases the capacity of hiding data. The length of the data is preceded to the data to be hidden to extract exact amount of data without the need of checking total picture. The number of bits required to identify the length of data is dependent on number of flippable blocks in picture. The embedded data is first encoded with the password for security purpose and then embedded which again reduces the number of bits required to represent data. The hidden data is extracted after decoding extracted bits from the stego-image with password without using original image accurately. Experiment shows the increased capacity of data embedding without causing noticeable artifacts. ©2008 IEEE.","Binary images; Data extraction; Data hiding; Image processing; Information security; Steganography","Cryptography; Decoding; Signal processing; Binary images; Data embedding; Data extraction; Data hiding; Efficient methods; Hidden data; Image processing; Information security; International congresses; Original images; Steganography; Stego images; Security of data"

When building large-scale systems based on popular commercial component middleware, such as J2EE, a usual way to enforce access control is to define access control configurations for components in a declarative manner. These configurations can be interpreted by the J2EE security service to grant or deny access requests to components. However, it is difficult for the developers to define correct access control configurations according to complex and sometimes ambiguous real-world access control requirements. The difficulties come from mainly the complexity of configuring voluminous component methods in large-scale component based systems and some quality constraints on the configurations, for example, the completeness, consistency and performance overhead of configurations. In this paper, we propose a requirements model driven approach for automatic generation of J2EE access control configurations and demonstrate the approach in a J2EE blueprint application. © 2008 IEEE.","","Chlorine compounds; Computer software; Control systems; Information services; Large scale systems; Middleware; Security systems; Access-control configurations; Automatic generation; Component methods; Component middleware; Control requirements; Information security; International conferences; Large-scale component based systems; Quality constraints; Quality software; Real-world; Requirements modeling; Requirements specifications; Security services; Access control"

Raghu, and H. Chen, Cyberinfrastructure for homeland security: Advances in information sharing, data mining, and collaboration systems. Decision Support Systems 43 (2007) 1321-1323]. Conventional steganographic models available in the literature on information hiding use the knowledge of cover-object and stego-object to extract embedded data. Embedding algorithms have been predominantly used in steganography for hiding data whereas encoding algorithms have been used for data compression. This research study proposes a modified model for steganographic system that incorporates encoding algorithms based upon the information theoretic model documented in Cachin [C. Cachin, An Information-Theoretic Model for Steganography, Information and Computation 192 (1) (2004) 41-56.]. The differences between the conventional model and the proposed model are analyzed in this study. We further implement the proposed model by designing a novel steganographic algorithm that utilizes animations as cover-objects. The proposed approach is then compared with an encoding algorithm for gif animations and a modified embedding algorithm with animations as the cover. Gifshuffle is a steganographic software that hides data in gif animations. Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit (DIIT) is a software that uses embedding algorithm to conceal data into images. DIIT is remodeled to hide data within animated images in this study. Experiments reveal that the encoding algorithms are suitable for information hiding using animations. The study finds that the proposed encoding framework with animations provides a practical framework for analysis and has a better security performance than Gifshuffle and DIIT. Although the proposed model achieves more hiding rate, Gifshuffle is computationally faster than other techniques. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Since then there has been many developments taking us to where we are today with these early security management standards being transformed in international standards published by ISO/IEC. These standards are being used by hundreds of thousands of organisations using these standards worldwide. Based on the authors previously copyrighted writings, this article explores what these standards have got to offer organisations, what benefits are to be gained and how such standards have helped with compliance.

However, valuable digital contents without proper protection make the content vulnerable to unauthorized copying, modification and re-distribution, causing revenue losses to service providers. Thus, constructing an effective Digital Right Management (DRM) system has become an important issue. On the basis of the mobile device, we propose an efficient digital rights management protocol.

Most intrusions to a computer system may result from illegitimate or irregular calls to the operating system, so analyzing the system-call sequences becomes an important and fundamental technique to detect potential intrusions. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, based on frequency patterns (FP) and tree patterns (TP) for intrusion detection respectively. FP employs a typical method of sequential mining based on frequency analysis, and uses a short sequence model to quickly find out frequent sequential patterns in the training system-call sequences. TP makes use of the technique of tree pattern mining, and can get a quality profile from the training system-call sequences of a given system. Experimental results show that FP has good performances in training and detecting intrusions from short system-call sequences, and TP can achieve a high detection precision in handling long sequences. © 2008 IEEE.","Frequency pattern (FP); Information security; Intrusion detection; System-call sequence; Tree pattern (TP)","Computer systems; Industrial engineering; Information services; Intelligent control; Intrusion detection; Mining; Call sequences; Control and automation; Frequency analysis; Frequency pattern (FP); Frequency patterns; Frequent sequential patterns; Information security; Operating systems; Quality profile; System-call sequence; Training systems; Tree pattern (TP); Tree patterns; Computer operating systems"

We focus on secure deletion mechanism in the NTFS file system, combining the asynchronous I/O multi-threading technology. Finally we present a novel data erasing algorithm, Quick Erase, which not only greatly exceeds the speed of the existing international data erasing algorithms but also can be easily combined with a variety of standard algorithms to form various high-speed mixed erase algorithms. It can be used to erase file data and metadata to ensure the security and reliability of data erasing. The test result of Quick Erase indicates that the erasure speed of one big file has reached 10-12 s/100MB, faster than that of existing secure deletion tools (60-80s/100MB).

The paper considers the challenges for Information Security from an organisational perspective and develops an argument that builds on research from the fields of management and organisational behaviour. It concludes that the human challenge of Information Security management has largely been neglected and suggests that to address the issue we need to look at the skills needed to change organisational culture, the identity of the Information Security Manager and effective communication between Information Security Managers, end users and Senior Managers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The major activity within risk management is the risk assessment process. The objective of this research is to assess the current state of practice in conducting risk assessments for information security policy management. Results from an exploratory survey of U.S. headquartered firms indicate that increased frequency of conducting risk assessments, the use of quantitative measures of likelihood of loss, and more complete asset inventories correspond with higher levels of user satisfaction and perceived usefulness, although many companies choose not to engage in this level of practice or to only go part way. Additionally, respondents reported substantial difficulty in identifying threats and estimating loss, indicating that much can be done to improve the current state of practice.

Design/methodology/approach - An inter-cultural study was conducted to investigate if users from the USA and Taiwan exposed to the same situational awareness learning would have different performance in those security awareness outcomes. Findings - The findings confirm that American users who received the situational learning outperformed those users who received the traditional face-to-face instruction. Taiwanese users did not perform significantly differently between these two treatments. Research limitations/implications - The study was only focused on two countries and therefore may limit its implications worldwide. But the study does show that global citizens also react differently to security awareness as would be expected due to differing cultures. Certainly, awareness of the risks and safeguards is the first line of defense that can be employed by any individual, but how individuals address these risks can be very dissimilar in different cultures. Therefore, the implications are apparent that the issue of security awareness should be studied from different cultural perspectives. Originality/value - This paper offers original findings and value into the investigation of whether or not situational security awareness training is culturally-bounded.","Data security; Taiwan; Training; United States of America","Cultural dimensions; Data security; Design/methodology/approach; Information securities; Learning processes; Security awarenesses; Situational awarenesses; Taiwan; Training; United States of America; Security of data"

The escalating magnitude of national and international laws and regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, Gramm-Leach-Bliley and Basel II, caused organisations to become increasingly aware of the importance of legal compliance and the obligations that arise from it. The challenge of meeting these obligations has become a complex web of requirements that grows exponentially as organisations cross international boundaries. This paper attempts to provide an interpretation of the legal aspects, as a starting point for clarifying compliance issues, as referred to by ISO/IEC 27002 (ISO/IEC 27002, 2005; previously known as ISO/IEC 17799, 2005). ISO/IEC 27002 further mentions three sources from which information security requirements can be derived, of which one will be focused on within this paper, namely the legal requirements. The interpretation of the legal aspects thus forms the foundation for motivating a proposed model for determining legal requirements, which in turn, indicates relevant information security controls from the list provided in ISO/IEC 27002, to satisfy the identified legal requirements. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Many organizations inadequately address this challenge from a 'bottomup' or piece-meal perspective, certifying and accrediting individual systems or focusing on perimeter systems and portals. A systematic enterprise-wide risk-management approach to information security and privacy is both practical and economically feasible, but must holistically integrate such requirements into both business process management and the technical infrastructure to be effective. The authors' development of the Roadmap for Information Security across the Enterprise (RISE) methodology establishes a systematic approach to security and privacy management by leveraging enterprise architecture approaches, and ensures implementation control by integrating the processes and responsibility with enterprise-level portfolio management. RISE defines an iterative threat assessment and response cycle and integrates it with capital planning and investment control (CPIC) for both operational and infrastructure initiatives.

Even if this rate goes to zero asymptotically (i.e. for sufficiently large codeword length), vital information bits can easily be leaked to an illegitimate receiver. In contrast, many of the recent results in information-theoretic security for wireless channel models with continuous random variables rely on this weak notion of secrecy, even though previous work has shown that it is possible to determine the ultimate secrecy rates for discrete memoryless broadcast channels under a stronger secrecy criterion - namely one which bounds not the rate but the total number of bits obtained by the eavesdropper. Seeking to bridge the existing gap between fundamental cryptographic requirements and ongoing research in wireless security, we present a proof for the secrecy capacity of Gaussian broadcast channels under the strong secrecy criterion. As in the discrete memoryless case, the secrecy capacity is found to be the same as in the weaker formulation. The extension to fading channels is shown to be straightforward. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Broadcasting; Cluster analysis; Codes (symbols); Communication channels (information theory); Cryptography; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Information theory; Random variables; Broadcast channels; Codeword lengths; Continuous; Discrete; Gaussian broadcast channels; Information securities; Noisy channels; Secrecy capacities; Vital informations; Wireless channel models; Wireless channels; Wireless securities; Security of data"

Constraints are extracted using a pattern based approach from legal texts of information security laws and policies derived from the security standard ISO/IEC 27001:2005. The UML extension UMLsec is then used to address whether the security requirements defined in a UMLsec model implement these constraints successfully.","Information security law; ISO/IEC 27001:2005; Model based security engineering; Security requirements; UML sec","Regulatory compliance; Security of data; Corporate governance; Industry standards; Information security laws; ISO/IEC; Security engineering; Security requirements; Security standards; UML sec; Models"

Major objective is to enhance the efficiency and performance of the industry and to ensure safe power supply to the customers by promoting the conditions, which would attract investments for industry modernization. All of this has caused profound changes in the Russian power industry, including changes in the state regulation system, foundation of new companies and establishment of a competitive electric power market. Structure of the industry would change in the course of the reform, including: segregation of natural monopoly (transfer of electric power, operating and dispatch control) and potentially competitive (production and marketing of electric power, repair and maintenance) functions, as well as foundation of structures to conduct specific activities in lieu of the vertically integrated companies formerly performing all these functions. Generating, marketing and maintenance companies for the most part are expected to become private and compete with each other. As far as the natural monopoly sector is concerned, the government control, on the contrary, is expected to increase. To this effect, supergrids are to be controlled by the Federal Grid Company, whereas distribution networks are to be integrated in the interregional distribution network companies (IDNC), while functions and assets of the regional dispatching administrations will be transferred to the All-Russia System Operator. Generation assets will be also consolidated into interregional companies of two types: wholesale market generation companies (wholesale generation companies - WGC) and territorial generation companies (TGC). WGC will consolidate electric power plants almost exclusively specializing in generation of electric power. TGC will mostly consolidate thermal power plants (TPP) generating both electric and heat power. Therefore, the former monopolistic structure of the electric power industry will be terminated resulting from the reforms, as the majority of vertically integrated companies will disappear from the market, to be replaced by the newly founded companies of the target industry structure. Reforming of the electric power industry will be accompanied by transformations in the information and communication infrastructure. Major purpose of these transformations is to ensure steady operation of the electric power market players and the entire electric power industry as well. Technological communication system of the electric power industry was created as information and communication basis for the control of the distributed Unified Energy System of Russia (UES of Russia). Aims and objectives the economic and technological management of the electric power industry is facing have predetermined and still determine the entire infrastructure, territorial topology and the applied hardware. Originally, the communication system was merely a technical basis for transmission of signals from systems of technical, technological and dispatcher control of the UES of Russia, i.e. just a technological communication system. Eventually, as information technologies evolved, the communication system has effectively assumed the functions of supporting the data exchange between corporate management systems servicing the production activities and business processes in the electric power industry. Thereby it evolved into a corporate communication system and has outgrown the technological control boundaries. The core of technological communication is particularly important, being the backbone network connecting the Central Dispatch Administration of the UES of Russia (CDA UES of Russia) and the Consolidated Dispatcher Units of the AO-Energo (hereinafter referred to as Regional Dispatch Administrations (RDA) of the System Operator). First stage of the backbone network connecting the CDA UES of Russia and the CDU was commissioned six years ago. However, having attained a new status, the communication system also retained its original technological purpose. As before, its functionality is a decisive factor for the smooth and reliable operation of the UES of Russia. Five years ago it was decided to authorize OAO FGC UES to build and operate the telecom infrastructure, both to meet the technological needs and to keep the electric power market functioning. Aiming to ensure smooth operation of the electric power industry in market conditions, it was also decided to transform the existing communication network into a United Technological Communication Network of the Electric Power Industry (UTCNEPI), which would possess all advantages of modern telecom technologies and making allowance for every prospect of the electric power industry.","Communication system; Information security; Optic-fiber line","Commerce; Communication systems; Competition; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Electricity; Electronic data interchange; Information technology; Investments; Marketing; Power generation; Security of data; Thermoelectric power plants; Corporate communications; Efficiency and performance; Electric power industries; Generation of electric power; Information and communication; Information and communication systems; Optic-fiber; Telecom infrastructures; Information management"

Face images stored within electronic passports (ePass) have to conform to ISO/IEC 19794-5 [Inta] which defines a number of quality requirements for facial image data. A software application (QS Software) is used to verify photographic image properties (pose, head/image size, height-to-page ratio, etc.) as well as setup properties (color depth, contrast, brightness, etc.) [Intb]. To ensure reliability and reproducibility of automated facial image processing systems it is necessary to assess the quality of existing software packages. To this end a database of facial image data would be of significant value as a testing base [HSM06]. The goal for project series FIReBIRD (Facial Image REcognition Benchmark Including Realistic Disturbances) is to establish a database of facial images that can be used worldwide for compliance and performance testing and quality verification based on ISO standards. FIReBIRD will be conducted in close cooperation of Fraunhofer IGD and the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and will be carried out in parallel and in international cooperation with the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the British National Physical Laboratory (NPL). After successful completion of a conceptual framework the international database will be built. This facial image database will consist of distinct data sets used by two separate user groups for two different purposes: public test data that is available for algorithm developers and non-public test data for system evaluation accessible only to authorized organizations such as BSI/Fraunhofer IGD, NPL and NIST.","","Application programs; Biometrics; Database systems; Image processing; Image recognition; International cooperation; Laboratories; Photography; Regulatory compliance; Security of data; Standards; Color depth; Conceptual frameworks; Electronic passports; Face images; Facial image processing; Facial image recognition; Facial images; Fingerprint images; Fraunhofer; International database; ISO standards; ISO/IEC; National Institute of Standards and Technology; National Physical Laboratory; Performance testing; Photographic image; Quality requirements; Quality verification; Reproducibilities; Software applications; System evaluation; Test data; User groups; Benchmarking"

The education environment experienced a paradigm shift over the last several years, due to the rapid growth in technology. This growth has made it possible for the education environment to utilize electronic services to enhance education methods. It is however vital that all education environments (traditional or new ones) ensure that all resources (lecturers, students and data) are properly protected against any possible security threats. This chapter highlights the importance of securing information within the electronic environment. This is done by providing key aspects that must be addressed and implemented to ensure information security.

To support this claim, various topics of the draft recommendation on the implementation of privacy, data protection and information security principles in RFID applications by the European Commission of February 2008 are cross-examined with and attributed to one of the four modalities. This paper concludes that the draft recommendation does not provide precise supplementing legislation to justify its implementation.

'Software requirements' are broadly divided into requirements for the server side and client side of the network. As a commercial venture, it is of great importance that only necessary software be found installed in a cybercafé, to meet the café user's need. Starting with an introduction, a general overview of the café user's needs are set forth, thereby leading to the division into two broad areas: server and client side. An outline of the chapter is given. The background section gives some details on some basic terminologies (server, client, operating system, etc.) that a cybercafé user/prospective operator might want to get acquainted with. Software requirements for the server side of the café network are discussed first; general features of timing softwares, notes on Internet security, viruses, and spyware. As the café server is a very important element in café management, it is necessary that the server is not overwhelmed by unnecessary tasks thereby leading to a generally slow network. Software for the client side of the café network is discussed next with emphasis on basic software applications often used/requested by café users. Examples of such are word processing applications and graphics viewing software. Since a lot of computer literate people are familiar with the Windows operating system, all software discussed for client use derives from such a perspective. Some security issues necessary for maintaining crisp client computers are also discussed. Due to lack of in-depth knowledge about information security among internet users, the future trends section discusses the applicability of the personal Internet communicator in the Nigerian environment, because of its portability and built in security. Other possible trends in security and cyber-crime are also discussed. The chapter ends with a note that café users will continue to demand faster Internet speeds, and therefore operators must be on the search for latest software to meet their needs, latest security software to keep their café network always clean and secure. Future research directions include software development research to allow café users modify or design their desktops to their own taste while in the café. Complete café solution software is also proposed to cater for everything from operating systems to end-user applications which can be installed once, and from a single source. Literature used for this chapter is sourced mainly from the Internet, and from personal experience of the author, as there are not literatures dealing with 'cybercafé software' on a specific note. A whole lot of software are been used, and could be used in a café. This depends actually on general client's requirements and/or the operator's amount of know-how/preferences which may vary across different environments. © 2008, IGI Global.","",""

In contrast, mandatory access controls (MAC) provide a stronger, finer-grained mechanism for specifying and enforcing system security policies. A related security concept called the principle of least authority (POLA) states that subjects should only have access to the spe-cific resources that they absolutely require to function properly at any given time. Although a number of existing projects (Plash and Polaris) seek to provide POLA implementations, these are not enforced using strong MAC. Conversely, existing MAC implementations (SELinux and Ap-pArmor) do not provide rigorous POLA because they do not provide an effective mechanism for dynamic policy modification based on user preferences. This paper presents our solution to fill this void, called the Pluggable User-space Linux Security En-vironment (PULSE), which implements a MAC en-forced, dynamic, user-level POLA implementation. Through the use of user-space plug-ins to specify se-curity policy, PULSE provides a high degree of dy-namism, flexibility and usability which is not avail-able in existing security architectures. ©2007, Australian Computer Society, Inc.

Cryptographic protocols for distributed computations are important techniques in pursuing this goal. An essential module in this context is the secure multiparty multiplication of two polynomially shared values over q with a public prime number q. The multiplication protocol of Gennaro, Rabin and Rabin (1998) is considered as the best protocol for this purpose. It requires a complexity of O(n 2 k log n+nk 2) bit operations per player, where k is the bit size of the prime q and n is the number of players. The present paper reduces this complexity to O(n 2 k +nk 2) with unaltered communication and round complexities. This improvement is possible by a loan from the field of numerical analysis, namely by the use of Newton's classical interpolation formula. The distributed version of the famous probabilistic primality test of Miller and Rabin is built of several modules, which depend on distributed multiplications. Applications of the new method to these modules is studied and its importance for distributed signatures is outlined. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","",""

However, the impersonal world of technical transactions places a barrier to secure identity authentication. The strongest security is implemented within hardware. Secure systems for identity authentication must protect internal workings from unauthorized inspection. At the same time, the need for quality is pressing for increased testing. Adequate testing requires extensive access to the control and observation of the internal workings of a system. These conflicting requirements are addressed by the statistical basics described in this paper. The goal of production testing is to deliver a high quality product to the customer. A methodology using test circuitry that both improves quality and provides security with reuse of the same circuitry is described. This paper presents an example of a system developed with this new methodology. We demonstrate that Built-In-Self-Test (BIST) signature analysis can test the prototypes and with some of the same hardware provide the security needed for encoding system outputs.

Since such software often implements vital functionality while on the other hand communication networks are inherently unreliable and insecure, protecting the software distribution process is criticai, both from the safety and the security perspective. Therefore an airplane software distribution system must provide protection guarantees which need to be verifled at a high assurance level. In this paper, we introduce a software distribution system architecture with a generic core component, such that the overall software transport from the supplier to the airplane is an interaction of several instances of this core component communicating over insecure networks. The main advantage of this architecture is reduction of development and certification costs. Further, we outline the security evaluation of the proposed system according to the Common Criteria (CC) methodology and describe in detail our formal model and veriflcation ofits main functionality using the AVISPA tool. This mix of formal and systematic informal methods is a key factor in achieving high confldence in the security of the software distribution system at moderate cost.","Formal methods; Information assurance; Loadable software; Safety; System architecture","Accident prevention; Aerodynamics; Aircraft; Costs; Embedded software; Formal methods; Network architecture; Certification costs; Information assurance; Insecure networks; Maintenance procedures; Security Architecture; Security evaluation; Software distributions; System architectures; Security of data"

Another form of denying availability is to prevent communication through the use of traditional jamming techniques. At the United States Air Force Academy Center for Information Security, we have been working on a new algorithm, BBC, which is based on a new type of coding theory known as concurrent codes that is resistant to traditional jamming techniques. While the formal definition and proofs of concurrent codes can be daunting, the algorithm's effectiveness can be easily conveyed and appreciated through visual demonstration.

This has boosted methods for hiding stego information inside digital cover content images which is a concerning issue in information security. On the other hand, attack of steganographic schemes has leveraged methods for steganalysis which is a challenging problem. In this paper, first we look at the design of classifiers, such as, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and neural networks (RBF and MLP) which are able to detect the presence of Least Significant Bit (LSB) matching steganography of gray scale images. Second, by combining with feature ranking methods (SVM-Recursive Feature Elimination, Kruskal Wallis) and reduction techniques (PCA) pattern classification of stego is successfully achieved. It is of utmost importance to look at the large set of features extracted from images and find ranking methods able, namely, to exclude correlated and redundant features, avoid the curse of dimensionality or circumvent the need of the steganalyzer to be re-designed. Results show that desirable properties of robustness and resilience are attained by designing classifiers able to deal with redundancy and noise. Moreover, comparison of classifiers performance emphasizes the chosen model for the steganalyser. © 2008 IEEE.","","Classifiers; Communication; Cryptography; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Machine design; Security of data; Support vector machines; Challenging problems; Comparison of classifiers; Curse of dimensionalities; Desirable properties; Feature rankings; Information and communication technologies; Information securities; Least significant bit matching; LSB matching; Pattern classifications; Ranking methods; Recursive feature eliminations; Reduction techniques; Redundant features; Steganalysis; Steganographic schemes; Steganography; Support vectors; Neural networks"

These EM threat forms are not new but are an emerging technical concern for information security because of the prevalence of electronics embedded into infrastructures. Electronics within fixed information processing installations, such as data centres, office accommodation, data recovery/backup centres and telecommunications exchanges, may be particularly vulnerable especially where physical security is not adequate or well maintained. EM disruption can cause long term availability issues for processing facilities as a consequence of inadequate incident response planning. Electronic eavesdropping may cause breaches in confidentiality and integrity through untraceable losses of sensitive information. Providing protection for each and every item of equipment can be costly. It is also difficult to justify costs where the magnitude of the risk posed by EM threats is not well understood. However, experience has shown that designing in EM protection from the outset of a project is known to be cost effective. This paper discusses assessment and detection methods which can be used to help to quantify the risk and assist with generating an appropriate response to an EM initiated incident. Other technical and non technical means of providing EM protection for a fixed installation will also be discussed.

In this paper, we relax the hypothesis of intervening when anomalies are detected: we focus on sensed data surviv-ability. Specifically, we study this problem in a specific critical infrastructure: pipelines. The problem we introduce is how to place sensors in such a way that the sensed data related to the monitoringof the pipeline will survive even in presence of a partial destruction of the infrastructure. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we introduce the problem of sensed data survivability in critical infrastructure. In this framework, the goal is to have the sensed data to survive to the infrastructure failure, so that the phenomena that lead to the failure could be better understood and possibly tackled in similardeployment. Second, we provide a model that allows to produce an optimal network topology with respect to the level of information assurance desired, while satisfying deployment constraints, such as available bandwidth and available energy of the sensors.

Consequently, organizations are having to prioritize the security of their computer systems in order to ensure that their information assets retain their accuracy, confidentiality, and availability. While the importance of the information security policy (InSPy) in ensuring the security of information is acknowledged widely, to date there has been little empirical analysis of its impact or effectiveness in this role. To help fill this gap, an exploratory study was initiated that sought to investigate the relationship between the uptake and application of information security policies and the accompanying levels of security breaches. To this end, a questionnaire was designed, validated, and then targeted at IT managers within large organizations in the UK. The findings presented in this chapter are somewhat surprising, as they show no statistically significant relationships between the adoption of information security policies and the incidence or severity of security breaches. The chapter concludes by exploring the possible interpretations of this unexpected finding and its implications for the practice of information security management. © 2009, IGI Global.","",""

As it matures it becomesmore central to the successful operation of our transport networks, develops its own brandand following, and becomes standardised. This is a journey that was wished for by thefathers of ITS; but what are the consequences for the operation of ITS as it grows up? By increasing the interdependency between ITS solution we also increase the risk andlikelihood that the operation of ITS can be compromised. So, does this mean we shouldrevert back to the bespoke systems of the past with ITS taking a back seat in solvingtransport problems? It is unlikely that travellers or providers of ITS would wish for this.What is needed is for the industry to fully understand the new environment, and to adoptways of working together that allow the risks to be identified, the likelihood to beappreciated, and appropriate measures to be adopted. What is required is for the industry to fully understand the impact of ITS not being available by: • Adopting an enterprise approach to the security and resilience of ITS, which accounts for the interconnection of ITS and avoids the current practices of assessment of individual schemes/projects/systems; • Understanding the consequences of failure in terms of confidentially, integrity and availability, and embedding factors such as consumer confidence in ITS in this understanding; and • Defining what can and cannot be tolerated, imagining what ""good"" looks like for a range of risk scenarios, and communicating this to the wider industry that is involved in specifying, implementing and operating ITS. There is a need for the ITS community to have a better understanding of the utility market in the context of ITS by the: • Utilities expressing how they work to manage risks and the measures that ITS can take to complement the measures put in place by the utilities to mitigate risk; • ITS community explaining how utilities feature in ITS and the type of expectations that ITS has of the utilities. The answer is not only the adoption of Information Management Security Systems, such as ISO27001.

We argue that alignment can be achieved by developing an understanding of enterprise risk management plans and actions, risk perceptions and risk culture. This is done by examining context, context and process. We illustrate this through the case of LeCroy Corp., illustrating how LeCroy managers perceive risk in practice, and how LeCroy fosters alignment in risk perception and execution of risk management strategy as part of an overall information security program. We show that in some circumstances diversity of risk tolerance profiles aide a management teams' function. In other circumstances, variances lead to dysfunction.

Rather than targeting technical vulnerabilities, a social engineer targets human vulnerabilities attempting to evade detection often by using a degree of identity theft to invent a relevant persona. Attacks are either conducted remotely to bypass technical controls, or on-site bypassing physical security countermeasures. In many cases the social engineering element of an attack is combined with other technical attacks (for example, obtaining authentication details using social engineering and using these to launch a technical exploit). Through a case study approach using a number of social engineering attack scenarios, this paper assesses the value of a series of security countermeasures. The proposed security model based on extensive industrial experience and theoretical research focuses on systemic changes to an organisation's processes that do not rely on staff training and awareness. This model of security is novel in that it is designed to reduce reliance on the human within the system and the vulnerabilities they exhibit, therefore reducing the likelihood and potential impact of social engineering attacks. By shielding the human element of security with effective systems, the exploitation of people with social engineering techniques becomes less effective, therefore making systems much more secure and robust. This paper discusses the development of a comprehensive security model to highlight the layer of human protection and the systemic protection that can be placed around information. This layered approach to security is not new, however, this model, is original in that it is applied in a social engineering context. The model is ultimately used to map the attacks and their respective countermeasures and therefore demonstrate how it can be used to successfully aid in countering the socially engineered attack.","Case study; Experience-based; Security countermeasures; Security model; Social engineering","Industrial research; Personal computing; Personnel training; Security of data; Attack scenarios; Case study approach; Experience-based; Identity theft; Industrial experience; Physical security; Potential impacts; Security countermeasures; Security model; Social engineering; Staff training; Technical control; Technical vulnerabilities; Techniques used; Theoretical research; Engineering"

We think that this is due to the fact that no approach separates information that can be provided by a central organization (e.g. known attacks, available controls, and a control's probability of protection) from information which must be provided individually (e.g. the controls installed).

The feature-based approach is efficient and robust to handle multi-sensor image fusion with little rotation or translation, or the image has to be aligned beforehand. The area-based approach has no strict requirement on rotation or translation, but lack of robustness. A combination of two approaches Is thus required. In this article, wavelet fusion is presented to analyze the effect of image fusion. Except for qualitative measures, quantitative measures are also proposed to evaluate image fusion. In particular, 2D discrete wavelet transform is used to both decompose images and reconstruct original images using the approximation, horizontal detail, vertical detail and diagonal detail components from the input images.

Cryptography can offer private communications between the RFID reader and tag by using elaborately generated cryptographic keys. These unpredictable and irreproducible secret keys determine the communication security, and they are normally created by a nondeterministic random number generator (RNG) [1]. In current RFID technologies, pseudo random number generators (PRNG) serve as random number sources. Owing to the mechanism of PRNGs, their output numbers show poor randomicity. These less random secret keys, with no doubt, reduce the security of data transmission. An oscillator-based Truly Random Number Generator application scheme in [2] provides a better solution. The TRNG exploits thermal noise of two resistors to modulate the edge of a sampling clock. The white noise based cryptographic keys prevent potential attackers to perform any effective prediction about the generator's output even if the design is well-known.

High technology online skills are now available for rent to a variety of customers, possibly including nation states, or individuals and groups that could secretly represent terrorist groups. The increased use of automated attack tools by cybercriminals has overwhelmed some current methodologies used for tracking Internet cyberattacks, and vulnerabilities of the U.S. critical infrastructure, which are acknowledged openly in publications, could possibly attract cyberattacks to extort money, or damage the U.S. economy to affect national security. In April and May 2007, NATO and the United States sent computer security experts to Estonia to help that nation recover from cyberattacks directed against government computer systems, and to analyze the methods used and determine the source of the attacks.1 Some security experts suspect that political protestors may have rented the services of cybercriminals, possibly a large network of infected PCs, called a ""botnet,"" to help disrupt the computer systems of the Estonian government. DOD officials have also indicated that similar cyberattacks from individuals and countries targeting economic, political, and military organizations may increase in the future. Cybercriminals have reportedly made alliances with drug traffickers in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and elsewhere where profitable illegal activities are used to support terrorist groups. In addition, designs for cybercrime botnets are becoming more sophisticated, and future botnet architectures may be more resistant to computer security countermeasures. This book discusses options now open to nation states, extremists, or terrorist groups for obtaining malicious technical services from cybercriminals to meet political or military objectives, and describes the possible effects of a coordinated cyberattack against the U.S. critical infrastructure. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Traditionally centralized SCADA/EMS solutions with local protection systems are merging into integrated protection and control systems utilizing for example wide area measurements. In such control system architectures, functionality needed for control and protection of the power system can be located at any platform within the distributed ICT platform. An example of this development is the use of autonomous systems and intelligent agents for power system control and operation. Another development is loosely coupled system architectures built on Service Oriented Architectures. Although these ICT based control technologies appear to offer possibilities of improved power system operation and control, they of course cannot be implemented if the overall security and safety requirements on the power system cannot be met. An obvious concern to raise regarding implementation of such systems for power system control and operation is the non-functional aspects of the systems in terms of their performance, dependability, interoperability and level of information security and how these effect the stability and safety of the power system. To address this challenge, we present a framework for modeling and evaluation of integrated protection and control systems that includes a wide range of non-functional aspects and offers support for decision making in design of such systems. The method is based on modeling concepts developed within the area of Enterprise Architecture and the use of a formalism termed Extended Influence Diagrams (EID). The EIDs are used to represent the relation between the attributes that constitute the non-functional aspects in question. The factors represented in the EIDs are all theoretically grounded and empirically established within the research community. The representation of the factors in EIDs further allows the evaluation of their inter-dependence using Bayesian logic. Based on the factors and their relation as described in the EID, modeling semantics for control system components that include these attributes are defined. By creating models of the intended system using these semantics, an engineer can evaluate the effect on the non-functional aspects under study from the design decisions taken.","Bayesian logic; Distributed Systems; Enterprise Architecture; System Integration","Control systems; Electric power system protection; Information services; Information technology; Intelligent agents; Network security; Semantics; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Bayesian; Control system architecture; Distributed systems; Enterprise Architecture; Information and Communication Technologies; Integrated protection and control; Power system operation and controls; System integration; Interoperability"

Based on this paradigm a novel approach to anomaly detection is presented. Our approach is based on a simple yet powerful analogy from the innate part of the human immune system, the Toll-Like Receptors. We argue that such receptors incorporated as part of an anomaly detector enhance the detector's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous behaviour. In addition we propose that Toll-Like Receptors enable the classification of detected anomalies based on the types of attacks that perpetrate the anomalous behaviour. Classification of such type is either missing in existing literature or is not fit for the purpose of reducing the burden of an administrator of an intrusion detection system. For our model to work, we propose the creation of a taxonomy of the digital Acytota, based on which our receptors are created. © 2008 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Security of data; Taxonomies; Anomalous behaviours; Anomaly detections; Anomaly detectors; Human immune systems; Information securities; Intrusion Detection systems; Intrusion detection"

Within Cigré, the first steps were taken in 2002 when the Joint Working Group (JWG) D2/B3/C2-01 - ""Security for Information Systems and Intranets in Electric Power Systems"" - was launched. The JWG delivered its Technical Brochure (TB) in 2006, where the purpose was to raise the awareness of information/cyber security in Electric Power Systems. Also, the ""domain concept"" for managing information security was introduced. The focus of the TB was mostly on the management issues, rather than on technical details. It was concluded that there is a need for a comprehensive Information and Control Systems Security Framework for electric utilities. Management of Information Security must be an essential and natural part of daily operations of various tasks in an EPU. As a successor of the JWG D2/B3/C2-01, the WG D2.22 ""Treatment of Information Security for Electric Power Utilities"" was formed in 2006. Here, the scope is narrowed in order to focus on and study certain aspects and solve specific questions raised in the former JWG. The following three issues are studied: Frameworks for EPUs, Risk Assessment, and Security Technologies. The purpose of this paper is to provide an intermediate progress report on work of WG D2.22. The WG will deliver its Technical Brochure in 2008/2009 and about five papers will be published, where this paper is one of them. So far, the results are mostly in the areas of security frameworks and risk assessment. The security technologies part will be covered more in the later parts of the WG. In the paper, it is concluded that among the various security approaches, an EPU must be competent to select and implement the best and adequate pieces and have in-depth knowledge of SCADA/Control domain requirements. The findings of a risk assessment survey show a clear lack of a reference method and it confirms the need for methodologies combining power and information security knowledge.","Electric power industry; Electric power utility; Framework; Information security; IT security; Risk assessment; SCADA; Security technology","Electric industry; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Network security; Scheduling; Security of data; Electric power industries; Electric power utilities; Framework; IT security; SCADA; Security technology; Risk assessment"

It is thus plausible to assume that low levels of IT security investment indicate that only a small portion of the firm's business is IT asset value driven. It could also point to a misaligned corporate investment policy. Conversely, some firms may be investing more than is warranted given the value of their information asset holdings, thereby wasting shareholder resources. The question then becomes: What level of IT security investment is enough? Several models exist to help companies set their IT spending in general and Information Security spending in particular. The leading model out there is the Information Technology Portfolio Management (ITPM) model. This is really nothing more than financial portfolio management theory applied to the information technology realm. Thus ITPM tries to optimize IT spending based on a number of factors like business value, efficiency and cost reduction among others. Despite current vigorous research at esteemed institutions like the Center for Information Systems Research (CISR) at MIT and at the Free University of Amsterdam, ITPM is still in its infancy and the field would benefit from alternative models. In this chapter, we propose an alternative model of IT security spending that firms may readily apply when setting their Information Security budgets. The model is analytical and starts by developing a model for the business value of information. It then develops a model for the cost of an information security breach. Finally, we find the relationship between the value model and the cost model from. © 2009, IGI Global.","",""

Dragon's internal state is quite large and unsuitable for constrained devices, and the authentication component works only for very short messages.

Further, accountability using best practice is essential to defensible governance. Information governance is a major aspect of governance and in turn, security is a major aspect of information governance. Implementing effective security is often difficult for those who are not security aware or trained. Whilst this poses serious risk for business, it is potentially graver for the custodians of personal medical information such as general medical practices. Research has shown that there exist severe deficiencies in information security in general medical practices, whose primary concern is the welfare and treatment of patients and not the security of the information systems. Although technological solutions are plentiful, it is the lack of awareness, non-acceptance of risk and lack oif suitable protection that pose the greatest insecurity. Methods for improving recognition of the need for security and its effective implementation, essentially a cultural shift in thinking about security, are necessary if information governance is to be fulfilled. In general medical practice, clinical governance is a becoming a fundamental aspect of medical practice even though it is a relatively modern concept. The objectives of clinical governance are to enhance the quality of healthcare by employing evidence-based decision making to improve standards of care, outcomes and cost-efficiency. Thus, monitoring and providing evidence of process and resultant improvement must be utilised supported by governance plans. In essence, clinical governance is a vehicle for promoting a cultural shift to a more cost-efficient and responsible service environment for medical practice. Therefore it is worthwhile exploring if an improvement in medical information security can be achieved using parallels with clinical governance term. These terms are already accepted by the medical profession. This theoretical investigation compares the objectives and use of governance in clinical and information applications. Further, it suggests that using a model analogous to clinical governance for information governance may provide a better method for sustained improvement in medical information security practice. Information governance plans would provide explicit evidence of attempts at quality improvement which is a cornerstone of meeting governance requirements. As information governance becomes a driving force for accountability in medical practices, methods to support this will be paramount. A clinical governance approach would benefit medical practices by providing them with a definable model for information security governance using a contextually acceptable paradigm. Further, the adaptation of an environment specific model would indicate how security, and thus the security profession, can provide pragmatic and practical assistance to those professions and organisations who do not retain security trained personnel.","Clinical governance; Information governance; Information security; Medical information security","Bioinformatics; Health care; Security of data; Clinical governance; Cost-efficiency; Cost-efficient; Cultural shift; Driving forces; Information governance; Information security governance; Medical information; Medical practice; Medical profession; Quality improvement; Quality of health care; Security-aware; Service environment; Technological solution; Theoretical investigations; Medicine"

The lack of resources training, the complexity of new technologies, and the slow legislation process to deter the breach of security all constitute to the trends of increasing security risk in an enterprise. Traditional approaches to risk assessment focusing on either the departmental or branch level lacks of an enterprise perspective. Many organizations assess and mitigate security risks from a technology perspective and deploy technology solutions. This approach ignores the importance of assessing security risk in policy and execution. This chapter discusses a systematic and holistic approach to managing security risk. An approach that utilizes the information life cycle and information assurance (IA) assessment points for the creation of policy, monitoring, auditing of security performance, regulate, and initiate corrective action to minimize vulnerabilities. An ""information life cycle"" is being proposed with its stage value and the underlying security operatives (gate-points) to protect the information.

Many transfer baggage are directed to a false destination or are simply getting lost during the flight procedure. Some of these, however, get taken away by another passenger by mistake (due to similarities in baggage) or intentionally stolen. Irrespectively of whether the loss can be attributed to a human or a computer error, it is causing enormous losses for both the airlines and the airports. To avoid these problems a new technology must be introduced at airports. This technology is Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) that minimizes the false identification of the baggage. The RFID is a widely applicable method for storing data and tracing products in the logistics industry. Due to security reasons like the fight against terrorism, the passengers' correct identification and tracking within the terminal, it is an issue of tremendous importance for the air transportation industry. With the RFID technology we can hit two birds with one stone. It is applicable for both baggage and passenger tracking. Indefinite amount of data can be stored with the RFID tag. The new trend for the identification of the passenger is the biometric method. However, it only serves to identify a person not to monitor the passenger flow within the terminal. The tracking of checked-in passengers within the terminal using RFID tags after entering the transit hall is on one hand facilitating the airport flow but on the other hand causing a big issue related to data security. To ensure the passenger's privacy rights the passenger should only be tracked from his entering into the transit hall and a one-way code will be used. To improve the airport's flow efficiency and to reduce the costs, RFID technology should be applied. The barcode-scanner, that is currently used as tracking technology is not reliable enough and can cause congestion. If many airlines adopt this new technology a common databank could be set up and legal provision can be adopted for the information security. Today's standards, which were written for barcodescanner technology, have to be changed.","Airport; Passengers; Rfid; Surveillance; Tracking","Air transportation; Airports; Biometrics; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Security of data; Space surveillance; Surface discharges; Air transportation industry; Biometric methods; Computer errors; Data bank; Flight procedures; Flow efficiency; Logistics industry; Passenger flows; Passengers; RF-ID tags; RFID Technology; Tracking technology; Airport security"

A survey of 136 undergraduate students attending a university and 54 illegal hackers attending the DefCon conference in 2003 was conducted. The results show that both groups perceive a higher level of punishment severity but a lower level of informal sanction for hacking than for shoplifting.

The discussion shows in particular the importance of staying within the theoretical underpinnings of corporate governance when discussing the topic of governance in general and in relation to boards of directors' responsibilities. Our critique opens up more opportunities to clarify information security's role and relationship to corporate governance.

Consequently their efficacy in protecting against anomalies is limited. The use of soft computing techniques like Genetic algorithms, Neu-ral networks and Fuzzy logic in implementing Anomaly detection is perused in this paper. Additionally, a few novel approaches for the detection of anomalies by iden-tifying user actions and network traffic that might com-promise a system's secure state, is also proposed. A po-tential solution to the problem has been contemplated, by comparing the performance of these systems based on various criteria. Characterization of the behavior of a sin-gle user (Host based) or a network (Network based) and recognition of anomalies through observation of deviation from normal behavior patterns are conducted to arrive at the solution.

In the LSB matching, if the LSB of the next cover pixel matches the next bit of secret data, do nothing; otherwise, choose to add or subtract one from the cover pixel value at random. In our improved method, a steganographic information table is defined and records the changes which embedded secrete bits introduce in. Through the table, the next LSB which has the same pixel value will be judged to add or subtract one dynamically in order to ensure the histogram's change of cover image is minimized. Therefore, the modified method allows embedding the same payload as the LSB matching but with improved steganographic security and less vulnerability to attacks compared with LSB matching. The experimental results of the new method show that the histograms maintain their attributes, such as peak values and alternative trends, in an acceptable degree and have better performance than LSB matching in the respects of histogram distortion and resistance against existing steganalysis.","Histogram; Histogram character function; Information hiding; Information security; LSB; LSB matching; Steganalysis; Steganography","Optics; Pixels; Statistical methods; Steganography; Histogram; Histogram character function; Information hiding; LSB; LSB matching; Steganalysis; Graphic methods"

Currently, Linux is becoming one of the most popular operating systems because of its excellent performance and open source philosophy. Since lots of individuals and enterprises are switching to Linux, access control mechanism of Linux has been improved from time to time for new security requirements. For instance, SELinux sub-system can enforce a policy based Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and provide flexible security policy configuration. However, there are still some defects in current Linux access control mechanism. In this paper, available Linux security mechanisms are analyzed at first, while permission division principle is summarized. Then a new MAC mechanism is devised based on some popular information security models such as RBAC, DTE and etc and it is characteristic of cross-layered permission assignment. Finally, a corresponding prototype system is implemented and further research directions are summarized.©2008 IEEE.","","Computer operating systems; Philosophical aspects; Security of data; Security systems; Access control mechanisms; Excellent performance; Information security models; Linux kernels; Mandatory access controls; Open sources; Operating systems; Prototype systems; Research directions; Security mechanisms; Security policies; Security requirements; Sub systems; Access control"

By isolating each application running on the end hosts, we extend our ability to scalably and effectively enforce policies beyond network communications to memory, file I/O, and inter-application communications. However, the functions are not merely those of a separation kernel, as applications must interact with the underlying host OS and other applications, whenever permitted by policy. A direct implication of our architecture is that the realization of an end-to-end security protection system must include specific security mechanisms on the host that would be able to isolate services and regulate their resources. Our approach exploits the complementary strengths of four well-known components: lightweight virtualization, kernel-level resource management, mandatory access control (MAC) frameworks, and stackable file systems. These mechanisms are available in many off-the-self systems. Finally, we show that our system does not incur significant resource overhead or performance degradation making them appropriate for real-time applications on resource constraint platforms. ©2008 IEEE.","","Access control; Ad hoc networks; Applications; Communication; Computer crime; Information management; Internet protocols; Network architecture; Resource allocation; Ubiquitous computing; Denial of service attacks; Dual roles; End-to-end protections; End-to-end securities; Host-based; Information assurances; Inter-application communications; Mandatory access controls; Network availabilities; Network communications; Other applications; Performance degradations; Real-time applications; Resource constraints; Resource managements; Security architectures; Security mechanisms; Stackable file systems; System platforms; Virtualization; Military communications"

The research described in this paper demonstrates a rigorous method for mapping the alignment between two example IT security standards. The two standards were Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT), widely used as a comprehensive IT control framework, and the Australian Government Information and Communications Technology Security Manual (ACSI 33) which sets out policies and procedures for IT security for Australian government agencies. Conceptual analysis was used to analyse the alignment between the two standards to reveal some insightful patterns of use and emphasis. As one of the security standards defines the base level ICT security for Australian government agencies, related future work using conceptual analysis has the potential to contribute to improved evaluation of the preparedness of commercial Australian organisations to protect the security of their systems from terrorist activities. This paper illustrates the value of such work within a counter-terrorist setting, where leverage for systems security compliance can be gained from voluntary adoption of a commercial standard.","ACSI 33; COBIT; Content analysis; Counter-terrorism; Systems security","Alignment; Information systems; Security of data; Security systems; Standards; Terrorism; ACSI 33; COBIT; Content analysis; Counter terrorism; Systems security; Regulatory compliance"

Based on the belief that any heavyweight security requirements process in organisational security will be doomed to fail, we developed a security requirement approach with three dimensions. The use of a simple security requirements process in the first dimension has been augmented by an agile security approach. However, introducing this second dimension of agile security does provide support for, but does not necessarily stimulate, innovation. A third dimension is, therefore, needed to ensure there is a proper focus in the organisation's efforts to identify potential new innovations in their security. To create this focus three common shortcomings in organisational information security have been identified. The resulting security approach that addresses these shortcomings is called Ubiquitous Information Security. This paper will demonstrate the potential of this new approach by briefly discussing its possible application in two areas: Ubiquitous Identity Management and Ubiquitous Wireless Security. [A.B.

Indeed, lasers allow for concentration of energy within tightly focused beams and narrow spectral intervals, thus offering high throughput, information security, weight and size of components, and power requirements that cannot be matched by rf systems. A key challenge is that high data rates should be complemented by high-precision wide-bandwidth position control of a laser beam. In many applications, the ability to maintain a link is affected by the complex maneuvers performed by mobile communication platforms, resident vibrations, and atmospheric effects. This work is focused on the application of acousto-optic technology as an alternative to electromechanical devices, which addresses the tracking problems encountered under such conditions. With the realization that an acousto-optic Bragg cell is only a component of the entire system, which should perform complex tasks of pointing and tracking of the remote terminal, we present an attempt to consider this problem from the ""systems"" point of view.

As a result, user handling has reached a degree of complexity where no single administrator can give satisfactory evidence about which users have access to certain information and who has granted those permissions to them. Compliance issues put even more pressure on the responsible managers. In-house Identity Management (IdM) has undoubtedly cashed in on that development as companies are forced to launch projects to regain control over what their users are doing within the IT-Systems. Identity Management itself, however, is only the starting point for getting compliant. The introduction of roles leverages IdM to the next level by simplifying the connections between users and resources and strengthening the overall security level. Therefore many companies initiate role projects in order to reorganise their access structures. Lacking experience and know-how, they are looking for a generic approach structuring the tasks within role projects. This paper presents proROLE, to our knowledge the first comprehensive process-oriented lifecycle model for role systems.

This paper reviews one aspect of that new environment, cross-domain sharing. By cross-domain we mean across classification and access levels with all of the necessary restrictions that is implied by that. The goal is to provide information sharing to all authorized users and hide and protect information from unauthorized or casual observers. We examine the requirements for data and information tagging, the search and discovery issues and the security aspects of these solutions. This portion of the architecture is slated to begin implementation by the USAF in evolution 3 of the Air Force architecture. Evolution I is currently under contract and being implemented.

Unable to eliminate these vulnerabilities, the security community is left to minimize their impact. Unfortunately, current reward structures may be skewed towards benefiting nefarious usage of vulnerability information rather than responsible disclosure. Recently suggested market-based mechanisms offer some hope by providing incentives to responsible security researchers. However, concerns exist that any benefits gained through increased incentives may be more than lost through information leakage. Using two years of security alert data, we examine the effectiveness of market-based mechanisms. While market-mechanisms do not reduce the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited, we find evidence that markets increase the time to vulnerability exploit and decrease the overall volume of alerts.","Information security/privacy; IS policy; Vulnerability disclosure","Commerce; Information systems; Information leakage; Market-based mechanisms; Security alerts; Security community; Security vulnerabilities; Vulnerability disclosure; Security of data"

Developing a solution to the moral hazard issue associated with information sharing in emergency service situations is a time sensitive issue that needs to be done prior to the needed sharing of information. This paper illustrates the challenges and opportunities that exist with respect to information sharing between users and providers of emergency services. Based on sound principles of agency theory and structuration theory, a framework to alleviate concerns and maximize information sharing utility is presented. The understanding afforded by the framework will assist both parties to in their efforts to effectively share and yet protect information that is vital to both emergency response and information owners.","Agency theory; Asymmetric information; Information security; Information sharing; Moral hazard; Structuration theory","Information systems; Risk management; Security of data; Agency theory; Asymmetric information; Information sharing; Moral hazard; Structuration Theory; Information analysis"

We first explained the basic approach that uses a simple GA ""figure presented"" ""Table presented"" to solve the halftoning problem, in which the input image is divided into small image blocks and the corresponding halftone block is generated by evolving chromosomes with two kinds of evaluation functions for (i) gray level precision and (ii) spatial resolution. This approach is promising in the sense that we can produce higher quality halftone images than conventional schemes such as ordered dithering, error diffusion, and so on. However, this scheme uses a substantial amount of computer memory and processing time that deprive it from practical implementations. To solve these drawbacks, next we presented an accelerated image halftoning scheme using an improved GA (GA-SRM) which uses two kinds of genetic operators, CM and SRM, and extinctive selection. If we introduce adaptive dynamic block (ADB) reduction with qualitative mutation for SRM, we can drastically reduce memory size and processing time to generate halftone images without compromising the image quality. Only 2% of the population size and 15% of the evaluations were required to attain the same image quality obtained by the basic scheme. Third, we focused on the multiobjective nature of the image halftoning problem ""figure presented"" to simultaneously generate halftone images having various combination of gray level precision and spatial resolution. The improved halftoning scheme using GASRM was extended to a multiobjective one for this purpose as well as to reduce total processing time. Consequently, we could reduce total processing time to 6% to generate simultaneously 11 halftone images with different weights for the two evaluation functions. Finally, we presented an interblock evaluation method to further reduce evaluation numbers in the GA-based image halftoning technique. We designed the algorithm to avoid noise in the fitness function by evolving all image blocks concurrently, exploiting the interblock correlation, and sharing information between neighbor image blocks. With this scheme, we could further reduce evaluation numbers to produce high-quality halftone images. Only 240 evaluations were required to surpass the reference value of image quality achieved by the basic scheme, which means only 0.6% of the total evaluation numbers required in the basic approach. We mainly focused on the reduction of computational cost and memory configuration in GA-based halftoning schemes. However, several possibilities exist for further improvement and extensions that should be investigated. For example, this scheme can be extended to multilevel halftone image generation [35, 36], and color halftone image generation which is now being investigated by the authors. In case of color halftoning, evaluation functions should be properly modified by considering CMYK representation of colors for printing devices. Also, another possibility is information security for halftone images by digital watermarking [13, 22, 26, 27]. One approach [31] shares a signature image into two halftone images. In this method, the embedded secret image can be decoded by optically overlapping the two images generated for authentication and delivery. These are only a few trials among several possibilities and the authors are looking forward to further improvement and development of this research field.","",""

It requires several interconnected activities: designing, implementing and maintaining a robust technical infrastructure, developing suitable formal procedures and building a widespread, agreed upon security culture. Thus, security managers have to balance and integrate all these activities simultaneously, which involves short and long-term effects and risks. For this reason, security managers need to correctly understand, achieve and maintain a dynamic equilibrium between all of them. The development of a simulation model can be an efficient approach towards this objective, as it involves making explicit key factors in security management and their interconnections to efficiently reduce organizational security risks. This endogenous perspective of the problem can help managers to design and implement more effective policies.

The inclusion of DODAF architectures in new system development is mandated in DOD acquisition regulations and is resource intensive. Deriving an information assurance architecture from a DODAF-compliant architecture is a relevant way to leverage the mandatory investment in DODAF architectures. Every software engineer supporting DOD should be aware of the increasing importance of information assurance and the need for holistic approaches to security. Information assurance architectures described in this paper offer a verifiable holistic approach to security. DODAF - based executable architectures provide a means for the modeling & simulation community to constructively engage in DOD information assurance efforts.","DIACAP; DODAF; Information assurance; Security architecture","Circuit simulation; Software engineering; Architecture frameworks; DIACAP; DODAF; Executable architecture; Holistic approach; Information assurance; Integral part; Joint capabilities integration and development systems; Security Architecture; Software engineers; System development; Interoperability"

The early implementation phase showed that there was resistance to change. The study revealed that lack of information was the root cause on that. Solution for this problem is proactive communications and use of internal advocates. All interviewees shared the same view that the ISO/IEC 17799 fits well with the existing organisation culture, and even changed it to a more security conscious one. The audit phase suggested that the audit mainly supported well organisations processes and the organisations got feedback beyond audit. After the implementation phase the workload was diminished and maintenance mode was mainly seen as reasonable. ©2007, Australian Computer Society, Inc.

Delegation is particularly useful in federated environments where multiple systems, with their own security autonomy, are connected under one common federation. Although many delegation schemes have been studied, current models do not seriously take into account the issue of delegation commitment of the involved parties. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a new mechanism to help parties involved in the delegation process to express commitment constraints, perform the commitments and track the committed actions. This mechanism looks at two different aspects: pre-delegation commitment and postdelegation commitment. In pre-delegation commitment, this mechanism enables the involved parties to express the delegation constraints and address those constraints. The post-delegation commitment phase enables those parties to inform the delegator and service providers how the commitments are conducted. This mechanism utilises a modified SAML assertion structure to support the proposed delegation and constraint approach. ©2007, Australian Computer Society, Inc.

More restrictive measures protect information integrity and user privacy in a better way but they make the systems less convenient to use. This study tries to investigate this question by developing a construct so-called user information security readiness that measure how willing and prepared users are to adopt the security measures and study its relationship with the level of information security measures. It is hypothesized that the relationship is moderated by how important the information is to the user, or information criticality. Data were collected from a web-based experiment on security readiness towards different levels of user authentication measures for different types of information systems. The preliminary result suggests that only when the information is relatively critical to the users does the strengthening of security measures enhance their information security readiness.","Authentication systems; Information security; Security readiness","Information systems; Security of data; Authentication methods; Authentication systems; Protect information; Security measure; Security readiness; User authentication; User privacy; Authentication"

We significantly revise the Fischhoff and Slovic model of risk perceptions --- introducing ordinal scales to the identified characteristics of risk perceptions, and incorporating the dynamics of perception by including the important and neglected time element. Over twelve months, we reviewed and verified the model with thirty five senior information security executives from industrial and governmental organizations.

Residual risk is the qualitative or quantitative risk that could not be removed, or which was accepted. Managing the residual risk is the core of risk management. This includes determining which risk to take, which to remove, and what to do with the residual risk. The quantitative residual risk calculation is based on calculating threats, vulnerability, asset value, and control gap. In this paper, the description of an economic model for acceptable risk focuses on calculating asset absorption instead of calculating likelihood. This model provides a more quantifiable measurement and is based on the assumption that the value of an asset is less than optional risk and Acceptable Risk = Asset Value%.

The concept of putting Personalized Knowledge Management (PKM) into practice is also coming into maturity with the aid of informational technology, managerial know-how and Web 2.0 models that are growing rapidly. Nevertheless, there also exists such a growing demand from website users that website managers provide better security mechanism to protect the information access to these knowledge bases from hackings. This demand is undeniably legitimate. It not only reflects serious concern among knowledge-website users that are expecting reliable information security mechanisms in an open-end working e-environment, but also points out the need that the website managers should take information security as one of the signposts to succeed in managing PKM websites. Admittedly, this demand on information security is especially relevant for PKM websites with Web 2.0 service-oriented digital modes as a result of their characters of being open, interactive and of multi-dimensional contents. This paper therefore is to address the concern mentioned above with the purpose of bringing forth a set of security mechanism for PKM websites from an integrated perspective of knowledge-base theory, management principles of website, and the Web 2.0 technologies. Three evaluation criteria of information security, i.e., confidentiality, completeness and availability of information are set as an assessing basis with the purpose of building a security mechanism for PKM websites as a solution to the above concern. The paper in the end concludes that the security mechanism suggested in this research will deter hackers by elevating their operating cost and effective reduce the potential risk placed upon the knowledge bases. It in turn will meet the security demand of PKM websites at work.","Information security; Knowledge base; Personal Knowledge Management; Web 2.0","Cybernetics; Information retrieval; Information science; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Management; Management information systems; Management science; Managers; Personal computing; Security of data; Systems analysis; Technology transfer; Digital modes; E-environment; Evaluation criteria; Growing demand; Information access; Knowledge base; Knowledge basis; Learning organizations; Management principles; Personal knowledge management; Potential risks; Security mechanism; Service Oriented; Web 2.0; Websites"

Online criminal activities pose significant social and economic costs. Apparently, the Fraud Act 2006 is the instrument that will now neutralise the threats posed by phishers and identity thieves. This concept paper is an attempt to chart a less tenuous path of claim and counterclaim that often rears its head when the subject turns to personal Internet security. Accordingly, the paper aims to initiate a debate on how we can begin to think about information security and the role of law against the growing threats posed by identity thieves and phishing. I draw on the insights of Sun Tzu in The Art of War as way of understanding how best we can manage and reduce complexity. The debates have all too often focussed on liability rules and legal reform. The resulting impasse can be overcome if the problem is first of all properly characterised. A balanced policy debate requires an understanding of two key matters - 'trivergence' and the gullible computer user. The hypothesis is that before we can think about regulatory tools to curb practices like phishing an identity theft we need a better understanding of the interactions between data, devices and networks.","",""

However, protection of information assets has to be taken two factors into account-time and cost. In other words, when it comes to risk assessment, an overall protection without discriminating different security levels of the information asset is not only cost-ineffective but also impossible in practice. Only by dividing information assets into different security levels and deciding which security measure fits the security needs can we have rational risk assessment for information assets. Banking industry is apparently not exceptional to this line of thinking. Nevertheless, most research reports on risk assessment of information assets of the banking industry are rarely made to the public as a result of security policy of its financial sectors. This paper selects one of Taiwanese major bank as a starting point and seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of its security measure by dividing its information assets into different security levels. Methodologically, the Delphi method is adopted by the paper and the questionnaires are designed based on the guidelines of information security management of BS 7799-1: 2000, BS 7799-2: 2002 and ISO/IEC TR 13335. The paper chooses 99 information assets that are subject to security concern as targets for risk assessment, and has 7 experts in information security and computer auditing answer the questionnaires with respect to current value of the assets, possible threats, vulnerability and degree of risks. Risks are presented as low, medium and high level, ranging over 9 degrees on risk scale. The paper reports the results that there is one item that reaches medium-level risk while others stay at the low-level area and it also suggests that enhancing security measures for all assets may end up with risk degree greater or equal to 2. A limitation of the research is mentioned in the conclusion part but with the belief that the results of the paper can be of value for academicians and security practitioners.","Delphi method; Information assets; Information security; Risk assessment","Cybernetics; Decision making; Industry; Information science; Information systems; Management information systems; Personal computing; Risk assessment; Security of data; Security systems; Surveys; Systems analysis; Banking industry; Degree of risks; Delphi method; Financial sectors; Information assets; Information security managements; ISO/IEC; Research reports; Risk degree; Security level; Security measure; Security policy; Security practitioners; Computer viruses"

This paper presents an access control model formalism using adaptive automaton on a Auditable Privacy System. The adaptive automaton is suitable for this purpose, because of the self-modifications capacity and complex languages recognition.

However, it is unclear how to effectively design security programs and messages such that they can inform and change user behaviour. The role of individual factors in influencing the processing of security messages is also unclear. This paper attempts to investigate these problems by studying the effects of security message characteristics and recipient factors on users' attitude towards security, using the information-processing theory of elaboration likelihood. Two models are developed for this study. The first model studies two message characteristics, argument quantity and quality, as determinants of attitude towards security. A 2×2 factorial design experiment will be conducted to investigate the influence of these characteristics on attitude moderated by the elaboration likelihood towards the security message. The second model tests the effect of four recipient factors on elaboration likelihood. The model development, experimental methodology, and data analysis details are described in this research-in-progress paper. The results are expected to inform the design of effective security messages and contribute to research in this area.","Behaviour; Information systems security; Security education and awareness","Design; Information systems; Security of data; Behaviour; Design security; Experimental methodology; Factorial design; Individual factors; Information security awareness; Information systems security; Model development; Model study; Model tests; Security education; Security incident; Security messages; User behaviour; Behavioral research"

As one of the fundamental discrete structures, combinatorial designs are used in fields as diverse as error-correcting codes, statistical design of experiments, cryptography and information security, mobile and wireless communications, group testing algorithms in DNA screening, software and hardware testing, and interconnection networks. This monograph provides a tutorial on combinatorial designs, which gives an overview of the theory. Furthermore, the application of combinatorial designs to authentication and secrecy codes is described in depth. This close relationship of designs with cryptography and information security was first revealed in Shannon's seminal paper on secrecy systems.

The double random phase encoding (DRPE) is one of the most representative optical cryptosystems developed in mid of 90's and derives quite a few variants since then. Although the DRPE encryption system has a strong power resisting to a brute-force attack, the inherent architecture of DRPE leaves a hidden trouble due to its linearity nature. Recently the real security strength of this opto-cryptosystem has been doubted and analyzed from the cryptanalysis point of view. In this presentation, we demonstrate that the optical cryptosystems based on DRPE architecture are vulnerable to known-plain text attack. With this attack the two encryption keys in the DRPE can be accessed with the help of the phase retrieval technique. In our approach, we adopt hybrid input-output algorithm (HIO) to recover the random phase key in the object domain and then infer the key in frequency domain. Only a plaintext-ciphertext pair is sufficient to create vulnerability. Moreover this attack does not need to select particular plaintext. The phase retrieval technique based on HIO is an iterative process performing Fourier transforms, so it fits very much into the hardware implementation of the digital signal processor (DSP). We make use of the high performance DSP to accomplish the known-plaintext attack. Compared with the software implementation, the speed of the hardware implementation is much fast. The performance of this DSP-based cryptanalysis system is also evaluated.","Digital signal processing; Double random phase encoding; Information optics; Information security; Known-plaintext attack","Cryptography; Digital signal processors; Encoding (symbols); Fourier transforms; Hardware; Optics; Signal processing; Brute-force attack; Double random-phase encoding; Double-phase encryption; DSP-based; Encryption key; Encryption system; Frequency domains; Hardware implementations; Hybrid input-output algorithms; Information optics; Iterative process; Known-plain text attack; Known-plaintext attacks; Object domains; Parallel hardware; Phase encoding; Phase retrieval; Plaintext; Random-phase; Security strengths; Software implementation; Security of data"

Many VANET systems have been developed in recent years. However, the majority of them have the assumption that all or most vehicles have wireless communication devices installed along with an elaborate road side infrastructure. This assumption is not true for the critical and long transition period when only a small portion of vehicles will be equipped with wireless communication devices (we refer them as smart vehicles) and limited roadside infrastructure will exist. In this paper, we present an economical, scalable and deployable VANET system design that could facilitate the gradual deployment of wireless communication among vehicles. Economical RoadSide Service Units (RSSU) that do not need expensive Internet access (especially in rural areas) can be incrementally deployed along critical road sections. They behave as traffic information storage and relay points to serve any passing by smart vehicles, while smart vehicles report/receive traffic information to/from RSSUs and relay information between RSSUs. In addition, RSSUs provide strong but economical information assurance to VANET similar to the public-key base Internet web service - RSSUs behave like web servers with certificates and vehicles behave like client computers. In this way, the mature Internet-like public-key infrastructure can be directly deployed in VANET without requiring digital certificate for every smart vehicle, which is complicated to manage and very expensive considering the huge vehicular population. We show that we can achieve connectivity with a high degree of confidence with a small number of smart vehicles and few RSSUs. ©2008 IEEE.","","Communication; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Internet; Military communications; Roadsides; Rural areas; Vehicles; Web services; Automobile industries; Degree of confidences; Digital certificates; Information assurances; Internet access; Public keys; Public-key infrastructures; Relay informations; Relay points; Road sections; Service units; Smart vehicles; System designs; Traffic informations; Transition periods; Vehicular ad hoc net works; Web servers; Wireless communication devices; Wireless communications; Wireless technologies; Ad hoc networks"

However, those good intentions of sharing the network bandwidth might attract the attention of intelligentsia and hackers to access personal or enterprise's confidential information. In order to provide more convenient utilization of networking and achieve the goals of resources sharing and protecting private information simultaneously, some protection strategies are proposed in this paper. Firstly, the network's security checking criteria based on behavior analysis of crackers' attacking and packet analysis have been applied for detecting and reporting the changes and events as if there is any failure of networking equipment or any problem occurred in real time. Secondly, software development for automatically checking, analyzing, and identifying the configurations of devices and finding out the kernel cause of security events of network system is a must. Thirdly, the anti-sniffing software and firewall must be updated to enhance its robustness against the attacking. Finally, encrypting software that combines the website system to achieve encryption and authentication simultaneously had better be applied.

However, the solution of such problems commonly requires an intermediary or a broker to manage information security concerns of individual participants. Our goal is to examine use of cryptographic techniques to attain the same result without the use of a broker. To illustrate this approach, we focus on a problem faced by independent trucking companies that have separate pick-up and delivery tasks and wish to identify potential efficiency-enhancing task swaps while limiting the information they must reveal to identify these swaps. We present an algorithm that finds opportunities to swap loads without revealing any information except the loads swapped, along with proofs of the security of the protocol. We also show that it is incentive compatible for each company to correctly follow the protocol as well as provide their true data. We apply this algorithm to an empirical data set from a large transportation company and present results that suggest significant opportunities to improve efficiency through Pareto improving swaps. This paper thus uses cryptographic arguments in an operations management problem context to show how an algorithm can be proven incentive compatible as well as demonstrate the potential value of its use on an empirical data set. © 2008 INFORMS.","Algorithm; Collaboration; Cryptography; Incentive compatible; Routing; Space-filling curve","Routing algorithms; Trucks; Collaboration; Cryptographic techniques; Delivery tasks; Empirical datum; Incentive compatible; Logistics systems; Manage informations; Operations managements; Pick-up; Potential efficiencies; Potential values; Routing; Space-filling curve; Trucking companies; Cryptography"

Contemporaneous to the increase in demand for IMA systems in the military and commercial aviation fields is the increasing amount of security required in airborne systems1. As the demand for IMA systems converges with the demand for secure systems, the need for composition of Information Assurance (IA) properties in such a SoS emerges. The IMA architecture and its associated IA properties are examined herein. An analysis of IMA system components is presented with the goal of forming a unified set of IA properties representative of a fully composed system that may be understood by those without domain-specific knowledge. The mission of composing identified recombinant IA properties is analyzed, using recognized assurance techniques such as those found in currently accepted security assurance documents (to the extent that they support the analysis).

Focusing on dynamic, uncertainty and collaborative between entities under large-scale distributed environment, theory of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied to the study of dynamic trust model. First, basic formal description is conducted for trust decision, and behavior state-space structure is constructed based on gain function according the interaction time sequence between entities. Then, applying RL algorithm, based on direct trust gain function and feedback trust gain function, overall trust degree fusion computing model is set up.

The impact of software viruses to information security has been felt by the entire computerized world, through loss of productivity and loss of system resources or data. But the research on hardware vulnerabilities looks far less than that on software attack. In fact, hardware is just as susceptible as software to ""hacker attacks"", through inclusion of malicious logic; and the consequences of such an attack could be disastrous! This paper discusses hardware threat from the view of information security. To identify the hardware attack, we design a system based on AL216 with hardware vulnerabilities.

The solution comprises of a protocol with several trusted third parties (TTPs) where there is a possibility of threat to the security. Our protocol unanimously selects one TTP among all TTPs in the SMC architecture that owns the responsibility of all the computation in the system. This TTP is called the master TTP and it is different at different times. The procedure of selecting master TTP could be non-deterministic but it is made deterministic by randomization technique. This ensures that no single TTP controls the entire system all the times. At the same time, this also ensures that no TTP knows where the computation is taking place. This approach is having merit over the other one where only one TTP is given the responsibility to hold entire data of the system. Hence, the chances of corruption can be reduce to negligible when we randomize the selection of one TTP instead of having unknown TTP. Our algorithm works on the concepts of multiple TTP to provide zero-hacking for the entire system owing to the situation that it becomes almost impossible for any party to break the security. Formally it is achieved by imposing high computational complexity on the parties.","Anonymizer; Data mining; Information security; Secure multiparty computation (SMC); Trusted third party (TTP)","Computational complexity; Computer crime; Information management; Personal computing; Anonymizer; Entire systems; Information security; Randomization techniques; Secure multiparty computation (SMC); Trusted third party (TTP); Network architecture"

However, security compromises are common and widespread and highly damaging. Next to attackers' increased sophistication, a root cause for the harm inflicted is that users often fail to optimally protect their resources or to recover gracefully from a security breach. We argue that users often underestimate the strong mutual dependence between their security strategies and the economic environment (e.g., threat model) in which these choices are made and evaluated. This misunderstanding weakens the effectiveness of users' security investments, and is compounded by heterogeneity within the user population, in some cases further reducing incentives for cooperation and coordination. We study how economic agents invest into security in five different economic environments, that are characteristic of different threat models. We consider generalized models of traditional public goods games (e.g., total effort and weakest link) and two recently proposed games (e.g., weakest target game). Agents may split their contributions between a public good (protection) and a private good (self-insurance). Our analysis centers on how agents respond to incentives when important parameters of the game (i.e., loss probability, loss magnitude, and cost of technology) are heterogeneous in the agent population. We also highlight key differences to the case of homogeneous decision makers. For example, security investments may become substantially more sensitive to the size of the network. We extend our results to discuss important modes of intervention.

This paper explores the definition and coordination of 16 activities integrating I A engineering, C&A activities and milestones, network operational planning, accreditation planning, connection activities and approval and IA operational management and maintenance. SSEA is embedded within and supports critical linkages among the engineering quality, control, development, integration, testing, and operational maintenance tasks.

While the focus is on U.S. DoD implementations, the SSEA approach is compatible with international standards. The SSEA approach has grown through experience with the guidance that has evolved over the past 12 years, including Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Common Criteria [2], and DoD Directive 8500.1 [3] and DoD Instruction 8500.2 [4], and the DoD 8510.01 DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP)[5].

Although we tend to think of information as abstract, information is physical, and computing is a physical process. How then should we understand information in a quantum world, in which physical systems may exist in multiple states at once and are altered by the very act of observation? This question has evolved into an exciting new field of research called Quantum Information (QI). QI challenges many accepted rules and practices in computer science. For example, a quantum computer would turn certain ""hard"" problems into ""soft"" problems, and would render common computationally-secure encryption methods (such as RSA) insecure. At the same time, quantum communication would provide an unprecedented kind of intrinsic information security at the level of the smallest physical objects used to store or transmit the information. This talk provides a general introduction to the subject of quantum information and its relevance to cyber security. In the first part, two of the stranger aspects of quantum physics - namely, superposition and uncertainty - are explained, along with their relation to the concept of information. These ideas are illustrated with a few examples: quantum ID cards, quantum key distribution, and Grover's quantum search algorithm. The classic man-in-the-middle attack is illustrated in regards to secret sharing (e.g., key exchange) to illustrate how QI methods can be used to thwart such threats. The state-of-the-art in quantum computing and communication hardware is then discussed, along with the daunting technological challenges that must be overcome. Relevant experimental and theoretical efforts at ORNL are highlighted. The talk concludes with speculations on the short-and long-term impact of quantum information on cyber security.

For instance, when the system gradually expand the scale, the assignment of the user and the assignment of the role's efficiency is rapidly decrease; the permission's transfer caused by the inheritance of the role, makes the contradictions between the number of role and the granularity of the permission be sharp gradually.

It will help enhance the competitive power of the whole enterprise and the multi-services of domestic intelligent transportation system to improve the secure and effective logistics information.","Commercial vehicle operation system; Information security; RFID; Web services; XML","Buses; E-learning; Electronic commerce; Government data processing; Information systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Internet; Markup languages; Multimedia systems; Real time systems; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Taxicabs; Trucks; Vehicle locating systems; Web services; XML; Commercial vehicle operation system; Competitive power; E business; Information security; Intelligent transportation systems; Key elements; Key points; Logistics informations; Multi-services; RFID; Rfid techniques; Transport distances; Vehicle conditions; Xml key management specifications; Vehicles"

With government regulations being enforced to protect these networks, it is important that organizations protect their network to avoid fines and law suits. This paper investigates how networks can be protected by uniformly enforcing policies and being compliant with government regulations regarding data security. The unauthorized access to information poses one of the greatest economic and social threats to an organization because of the potential use of the information getting into the wrong hands. The use of the Internet, Intranet, and Extranet has had major impact on computer and information security. Data networks should be protected in order to ensure data integrity, data confidentiality and data availability as they are vital to daily operation of any organization. The loss of or leakage of sensitive information must be prevented to help businesses remain competitive. The paper will investigate how policies and information security can be best use to protect data across a corporate network. The compliance with new regulations for data governance is difficult to demonstrate to the end user and stakeholders. This paper will demonstrate how the use of training and education will go a long way in achieving security results. This paper will deal with policies and regulations, information security as they are transmitted on data network as well as the technologies involved.","Information security; Network security","Extranets; Internet; Laws and legislation; Corporate informations; Corporate networks; Data availabilities; Data communications; Data confidentialities; Data integrities; Data networks; Data securities; End users; Government regulations; Information security; Law suits; Personal informations; Sensitive informations; Trade secrets; Training and educations; Network security"

In this paper we develop a system dynamics model of the interplay between. technical and behavioral security factors, along with their impact on business value of an organization's IT infrastructure. The model captures delays associated with perception of security risk, the mechanics of user compliance and the mechanics of risk mitigation achieved by investments in security technology and user training. These structural model components interact to mediate the impact of security incidents on the business value generated by information technology enabled transactions. The model reveals the dynamics of erosion in and recovery of business value resulting from security incidents. Experiments with the model suggest that information security drills, analogous to fire drills, may be useful in maintaining user compliance, in addition to usual training and awareness activities. Among the management policy parameters examined, we find that improvement in realized business value is statistically significant for the minimum security risk the firm is willing to accept, and the proportion of security-related investment spent on sedirity technology versus security training and awareness. We also discuss how our model can be extended to help justify an organization's investments in information security, an objective that has been notoriously difficult to achieve in practice.

As information security is one of the pervasive themes in IT curriculum, it is reasonable to design a security thread in a Thread-based curriculum. As computing security becomes more important in all sectors of society, so does the preparation of our students with knowledge and understanding of critical security concepts, methodologies, and techniques. Unfortunately, despite the deep and pervasive impact of security, undergraduate IT curricula and programs today often lack a cohesive model to deliver information assurance education to a wider audience, offering security courses beyond the limitation of a track, concentration, or a security minor. We want to infuse information security into our IT curriculum, and we found a good model for doing that.

Buffer overflows had been the most common vulnerability type since CERT began collecting statistics, but web application vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting have dominated vulnerability reports since 2005. Despite billions of dollars spent on network security, the amount lost to computer crime, much of it the result of the insecurity of web applications, grows every year. In part, this problems results from the fact that perimeter security techniques like firewalls do little to protect web applications. In order for students to be prepared for the current threat environment, we need to integrate web application security into the IT curriculum. Both information security and web programming classes need to cover this topic. This paper describes techniques, tools, and labs for integrating web application security into both types of classes. Some techniques, such as penetration testing using web proxies, are applicable to both types of classes. Other techniques, such as secure programming guidelines, are primarily useful in web programming classes, while some tools, like web application firewalls, are more important in information security classes. We use the open source web application security teaching tool WebGoat for introductory labs that teach the students about the nature of specific vulnerabilities like SQL injection. These labs also introduce students to open source web testing proxies, such as Burp Suite, which they use more deeply in later labs that focus on penetration testing of a complete web application. Students in security classes also learn how to use web vulnerability scanners and web application firewalls, while web programming classes focus on learning how to write code without common vulnerabilities. © 2008 ACM.","Web application security; Web security education","Applications; Computer networks; Computer system firewalls; Curricula; Information technology; Laboratories; Network security; Students; Teaching; World Wide Web; Buffer overflows; Cross-site scripting; Information securities; Open sources; Penetration testing; Perimeter securities; Secure programming; SQL injections; Teaching tools; Threat environments; Vulnerability scanners; Web application firewalls; Web application security; Web application vulnerabilities; Web applications; Web programming; Web proxies; Web security education; Web testing; Computer viruses"

Adversaries are now appearing as legitimate users to Department of Defense (DoD) applications and networks, while threatening the integrity and confidentiality of DoD information. Attackers are frequently exploiting hardware and software vulnerabilities before DoD can test and disseminate effective patches. The complexity of Information Technology (IT) management operations and security is a constant challenge for enterprises (both large and small). Balancing the workforce's need for availability and ease of use while complying with the frequent security advisories, bulletins, changes, and reporting requirements can be daunting. The continuous enhancements and upgrades combined with the requirement to react to security threats to both operating systems and applications are overwhelming the routine operational capability for the System and Security Administrators. Many organizations continue to treat asset management; configuration management; data protection; access control; intrusion prevention; risk analysis; compliance; vulnerability management; Certification and Accreditation (C&A); incident detection and response; and reporting as isolated processes that rarely, if ever, interact. The stove-piping of these critical network and system operations results in inconsistent views of IT assets and their security postures, inefficient use of resources, and the inability to accurately assess the overall security status of the organization at any given time. Additionally, the C&A and Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) processes, along with the annual Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) reporting, has become a resource intense, complex, and sometimes unpredictable process.

So, it is very difficult to quantify and forecast trust-ship accurately. In this paper, firstly, a new and adaptive trusted decision-making method based on historical evidences window is proposed, which not only can reduce the risk and improve system efficiency, but also can solve trust measurement and forecasting problem when the direct evidences are insufficient. Then, predicting model use a feedback trust information aggregating algorithm based on Direct Trust Tree (DTT). Lastly, a new parameter, feedback factor, is introduced to adjust the weight of feedback trust automatically, which overcomes the shortage of traditional method, in which the weight is set up by subjective manners, and makes the model has a better rationality and a higher practicability. Simulation's results show that, compared to the existing trust metrics, this model has remarkable enhancements in the trust decision's accuracy. © 2008 Binary Information Press.","Distributed system; Dynamic trusted model; Information security","Open systems; Risk perception; Adaptive predictions; Cognitive process; Decision-making method; Distributed system; Forecasting problems; Information security; New parameters; Open distributed systems; Predicting models; Social relationships; System efficiency; Trust measurement; Trust metrics; Trust relationship; Cognitive systems"

The purpose is to study the impact of a cyber attack on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Compliance of the requirement to meet the standard has become increasingly challenging as the system becomes more dispersed in wide areas. Interdependencies between computer communication system and the physical infrastructure also become more complex as information technologies are further integrated into devices and networks. This paper proposes a vulnerability assessment framework to systematically evaluate the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems at three levels: system, scenarios, and access points. The proposed method is based on cyber systems embedded with the firewall and password models, the primary mode of protection in the power industry today. The impact of a potential electronic intrusion is evaluated by its potential loss of load in the power system. This capability is enabled by integration of a logic-based simulation method and a module for the power flow computation. The IEEE 30-bus system is used to evaluate the impact of attacks launched from outside or from within the substation networks. Countermeasures are identified for improvement of the cybersecurity. © 2008 IEEE.","Cyber-physical system; Dependability measures; Passwords; Petri nets; Power systems; Vulnerability indices","Communication systems; Computer crime; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Flow simulation; Graph theory; Petri nets; Regulatory compliance; Simulators; Systems engineering; Cyber-physical system; Dependability measures; Passwords; Power systems; Vulnerability indices; SCADA systems"

In order to be efficient on a target architecture, ECCs require accurate choice/tuning of the algorithms that perform the underlying mathematical operations. This paper contributes with a cycle-level analysis of the dependencies of ECC performance from the interaction between the features of the mathematical algorithms and the actual architectural and microarchitectural features of an ARM-based Intel XScale processor. Another contribution is the cycle-level analysis of a modified ARM processor that includes a word-level finite field polynomial multiplier (poly_mul) in its data path. This extension constitutes a good trade-off between applicability in a number of contexts, the simplicity of integration within the processor, and performance. This paper points out the most advantageous mix of elliptic curve (EC) parameters both for the standard ARM-based Intel XScale platform and for the one equipped with the polyjnul unit. In particular, the latter case allows for more than 41 percent execution time reduction on the considered benchmarks. Last, this paper investigates the correlation between the possible architectural organizations of a processor equipped with poly_mul unit(s) and EC benchmark performance. For instance, only superscalar pipelines can exploit the features of out-of-order execution and only very complex organizations (for example, four way superscalar) can exploit a high number of available ALUs. Conversely, we show that there are no benefits in endowing the processor with more than one poly_mul, and we point out a possible trade-off between performance and complexity increase: A two-way in-order/out-of-order pipeline allows +50 percent and +90 percent of Instructions per Cycle (IPC), respectively. Finally, we show that there are no critical constraints on the latency and pipelining capability of the polyjnul unit for the basic EC point multiplication. © 2008 IEEE.","Cryptography; Elliptic curves; Embedded systems; Instruction set extesion; Performance evaluation; Processor architecture","Architecture; Atmospheric radiation; Blood vessel prostheses; Computer architecture; Cryptography; Electric conductivity measurement; Embedded systems; Graph theory; Integrated circuits; Pipelines; Architectural organizations; ARM processors; Curve cryptographies; Elliptic curve cryptographies; Elliptic curves; Embedded devices; Embedded processors; Execution time; Finite fields; Information securities; Instruction set extesion; Instruction-set extensions; Instructions per cycles; Its datum; Mathematical algorithms; Mathematical operations; Out-of-order executions; Performance evaluation; Point multiplications; Processor architecture; Superscalar; Superscalar pipelines; Target architectures; Pipeline processing systems"

Content, delivery method, course requirements, and support were quickly recognized as obstacles. Pilot training was completed and formal training began with the delivery of ISO standard Information Security training to students. After one semester, the obstacles forced us to make the decision to develop our own course content. The information security director, a part-time assistant, one graduate student, an instructional designer, and several members of the WVU iS 3PACE (Information Security Services System Promoting Awareness Communication Education) information security collaborative contributed to the effort.

The state of each link in the graph is marked as normal, suspended, or abnormal by comparing its weight with the threshold. We apply it to the log files from a UNIX web server and simulate the attack traffics.

The NCHC research team developed a resource broker with proposed scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm used the adaptive resource allocation and dynamic loading prediction functions to improve the performance of dynamic scheduling. The resource broker is based on the framework of GridWay which is a metascheduler for Grid, so the proposed resource broker can be implemented in real Grid Computing environment.

We have developed a simple, low-cost digital wireless broadcasting system prototype, intended for a classroom of hearing impaired students. The system is designed to be a low-cost alternative to an existing FM system. Method. The system implemented is for short-range communication, with a one-transmitter, multiple-receiver configuration, which is typical for these classrooms. The data is source-coded for voice-band quality, FSK modulated, and broadcasted via a 915 MHz radio frequency. A DES encryption can optionally be added for better information security. Results. Test results show that the system operating range is approximately ten metres, and the sound quality is close to telephone quality as intended. We also discuss performance issues such as sound, power and size, as well as transmission protocols. Conclusions. The test results are the proof of concept that the prototype is a viable alternative to an existing FM system. Improvements can be made to the system's sound quality via techniques such as channel coding, which is also discussed. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.","ALD; ALS; Assistive technology; digital communication; wireless","Acoustics; Amplifiers, Electronic; Communication Aids for Disabled; Hearing Aids; Hearing Impaired Persons; Hearing Loss; Human Engineering; Humans; Radio; acoustics; amplifier; article; bioengineering; communication aid; economics; hearing aid; hearing loss; human; instrumentation; patient; telecommunication"

Therefore there is strong need of satellite imagery encryption and decryption application for security. Satellite Imagery Security Application (SISA) is an information security application developed for satellite imagery. The application supports new and modified version two most popular data encryption standards named as Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This paper investigates the security and performance level of the new modified version DES and AES for satellite imagery. The method of application of DES and AES on the satellite imagery in each case is explained. The application provides conventional tools of measurement and analysis such as key sensitivity, statistical and performance analysis to determine the level of security, reliability and performance.","","Aerospace industry; Cryptography; Network security; Reliability analysis; Signal analysis; Standards; Advanced Encryption Standard; Data encryption standard; Encryption and decryption; Information security; Large-scale research; Measurement and analysis; Network communications; Performance analysis; Secure storage; Security and performance; Security application; Shared network; Space science; Space technologies; Satellite imagery"

Hence, exposing of data to the unauthorized parties has always raised questions relating to individual privacy, data and information security. Still these data needs to be exposed for effective data mining applications. Till today, researchers are trying their best to address the privacy issue by different techniques such as randomization and cryptographic techniques. This paper addresses the problem of privacy preserving data mining by transforming the attributes to fuzzy attributes. Thus, the data security is also maintained, as one can not predict the exact value, at the same time, better accuracy of mining algorithms is achieved. K-NN and J48 classification algorithms with four datasets are used in the experiments to show the viability of the approach. In this work, we have used two privacy measures namely, Bias in Mean (BIM) and Bias in Standard Deviation (BISD) to measure information loss. Experimental results, both in terms of classifier accuracy as well as privacy measures, suggest that the fuzzy based transformation technique can be adopted for privacy preserving data mining.","","Data privacy; Information management; Classification algorithms; Cryptographic techniques; Data and informations; Data mining applications; Data securities; Data-sets; Fuzzy attributes; Individual privacies; Information loss; Mining algorithms; Privacy issues; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving data minings; Problem of privacies; Sensitive informations; Standard deviations; Transformation techniques; Data mining"

To prevent fraud or abuse due to conflict of interests, a well-known authorization constraint called Separation of Duty (SoD) is commonly applied. SoD ensures that no single user receives too many authorities. Enforcement of authorization constraints such as SoD in large organizations can be difficult due to the large number of information system users, the variety of assets involved, and tasks that require roles that may be shared or delegated at multiple levels. Most existing work in this area focuses on specifications of SoD constraints and assumes that constraints can be enforced by logical inference mechanisms at run-time. A drawback of this approach is that when violations occur, finding alternative role activations at run-time may not be feasible. This can result in delays or even failure for critical service transactions. Moreover, logic-based systems are difficult to understand and do not scale easily. This paper presents an algorithmic set-based approach that automatically checks for SoD compliance prior to run-time by searching for a set of valid role activations.

Our approach integrates the power optimization with confidentiality services to maintain the secrecy of the data. Several traditional power optimization techniques involve stopping the disk completely when the loads on the storage disks are really low. Our approach makes use of the new evolving technique, Dynamic Speed Control for power management (DRPM), when the idle times between the requests are not very high.

Traditional security mechanism protects data at physical level such as encryption and access control, but today's organizations need to protect data on both levels physical and logical level. Since the organization's data may be published and shared by many users. Disclosure is a result of weakness of these security mechanisms. In this paper we discuss the problem of protecting XML data at logical level specifically solve the disclosure problem. The objective is to prevent an unauthorized user to infer sensitive information through the data they authorized to access (result of previous queries), integrity constraints, and using inferences. In most existing access control approaches the XML elements specified by access policies are either accessible or inaccessible according to their sensitivity. However, in some cases, the original XML elements are sensitive and inaccessible, but after being processed in some appropriate ways, the results become insensitive and thus accessible [6].

The fact that there is no central infrastructure and that the devices can move randomly gives rise to various kinds of problems, such as routing and security. Attacks on routing protocols can create various undesirable effects that defeat the objectives of ad-hoc routing, Ad hoc networks are much more vulnerable to malicious exploits than a wired network. Secure communication is an important aspect of any network environment. Therefore to provide secure ad hoc network: authentication, confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation and access control should be provided. Authentication comes in the first place to ensure secure network operation, since other services depend on the authentication of communication entities. In mobile ad hoc, there is possibility of nodes being compromised, therefore, the network should not have any central control but instead have distributed architecture; when avoiding central control it's more difficult to implement authentication protocol. In this paper, the recently developed identity based scheme with threshold secret sharing will be used in two different scenarios; in the first scenario the serving nodes have been assumed as fixed nodes, in the second scenario the serving nodes have been assumed as mobile nodes. The purpose of applying this scheme is to provide authentication, confidentiality, reduce computation cost and avoid central control. The proposed algorithm has been built and tested using computer simulator method. The simulator that has been used to simulate the ad hoc authentication protocol is a self-developed simulator. © 2008 IADIS.","Ad hoc network; Authentication; Information security","Access control; Authentication; Computers; Information systems; Network architecture; Routing protocols; Security of data; Simulators; Telecommunication; Telecommunication networks; Telecommunication systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad hoc network; Ad hoc networking; Authentication protocols; Central control; Communication entities; Computation costs; Hoc networks; Identity-based; Information security; Mobile node (MN); Network environments; Network operations; Portable devices; Secret sharing; Secure communications; Undesirable effects; Ad hoc networks"

This is a concern for security teams, especially since a lack of dedicated resources exists to combat and revert this trend. This is significantly important to take into consideration when going through the formal audit process to certify adherence to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), Graham Leach Bliley (GLBA), Payment Card Industry (PCI), or the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

However, how to authenticate each other and agree on a session key has not been efficiently solved. In 2007, Wang and Zhang proposed a key agreement protocol and a new authentication and key agreement mechanism for SIP. In this paper, we prove that Wang and Zhang's key agreement protocol is insecure due to its susceptibility to the key replacement attack. Moreover, we have also realized that their protocol do not satisfy the perfect forward secrecy and known session-specific temporary information security attribute. Based on this, we propose an enhanced protocol and a new mutually authenticated key agreement protocol for SIP, Compared with the Wang and Zhang's scheme for SIP regarding the robustness and computation overheads, our scheme is more efficient and thus is more suitable for SIP. © 2008 IEEE.","Authentication; Bilinear pairings; Certificateless public-key cryptography; Key agreement; Sip","Access control; Authentication; Cryptography; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Wireless telecommunication systems; Authenticated key agreement protocols; Authentication and key agreements; Bilinear pairings; Certificateless public-key cryptography; Computation overheads; Information securities; Key agreement; Key agreement protocols; Perfect forward secrecies; Session Initiation Protocols; Session keys; Signaling protocols; Sip; Internet protocols"

This paper retrospectively analyzes the progress of eventbased capability and their applicability in various domains. Although research on event-based approaches started in a humble manner with the intention of introducing triggers in database management systems for monitoring application state and to automate applications by reducing/eliminating user intervention, currently it has become a force to reckon with as it finds use in many diverse domains. This is primarily due to the fact that a large number of real-world applications are indeed event-driven and hence the paradigm is apposite. The other purpose of this paper is to identify and establish the synergy between stream processing and event processing. The resurgence of complex event processing (or CEP) has demonstrated the resiliency of this paradigm and its relevance to a large class of applications. In addition, the advent of stream processing based on sensor and other data generated on a continuous basis has, in our opinion, enhanced the role of events in critical ways. Instead of implicitly assuming event generation, stream processing indeed provides a powerful mechanism for generating interesting events. In this paper, we briefly overview the development of the ECA (or event-condition-action) paradigm. We briefly discuss the evolution of the ECA paradigm (or active capability) in Relational and Object-oriented systems. We then describe several diverse applications where the ECA paradigm has been used effectively. The applications range from customized monitoring of web pages to specification and enforcement of role-based access control policies (RBAC).

However, few empirical studies have been conducted to test social engineering theory and the reasons why people may or may not fall victim, and even fewer have tested recommended treatments. Building on theory using threat control factors, the purpose of this paper is to compare the efficacy of recommended treatment protocols. Design/methodology/approach - A confirmatory factor analysis of a threat control model was conducted, followed by a randomized assessment of treatment effects using the model. The data were gathered using a questionnaire containing antecedent factors, and samples of social engineering security behaviors were observed. Findings - It was found that threat assessment, commitment, trust, and obedience to authority were strong indicators of social engineering threat success, and that treatment efficacy depends on which factors are most prominent. Originality/value - This empirical study provides evidence for certain posited theoretical factors, but also shows that treatment efficacy for social engineering depends on targeting the appropriate factor. Researchers should investigate methods for factor assessment, and practitioners must develop interventions accordingly. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Data security; Risk analysis; Systems analysis","Behavioral research; Engineering; Programming theory; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Safety factor; Systems analysis; Confirmatory factor analysis; Control factors; Control models; Data security; Design/methodology/approach; Empirical studies; Focal points; Human behaviors; Information securities; Security threats; Social engineerings; Threat assessments; Treatment effects; Security of data"

Then the request message is computed by using both the user's password and the registered information based on properties of Euclidean geometry and one-way hash functions. In the system verification phase, the CA verifies the validity of a user based on its request message and the CA's secrets. Only the CA can do the verification because only it knows its secret. The verification is fast because it does not need to access the database and its computation is simple. The timestamp allows the proposed scheme to withstand replay attacks. The security analysis shows that our scheme is also secure against eavesdropping attacks, and dictionary attacks. A formal approach is adopted to prove the proposed scheme is secure.

In this article, a novel method of soft encryption is proposed for multi-path routing data transmission. All messages are divided into a number of parts and self-encrypted by simple operations. The trust level assigned to a node of route path is a combination of direct interaction with its neighbors and the recommendations from its peers. The smallest average trust level of multi-path decides that how many parts should be encrypted by using cryptographic method. The mechanism is described, which obviously reduces the cost of using cryptographic method to encrypt entire message while security is ensured. © 2008 IEEE.","Ad-hoc security; Cryptographic; Efficiency; Method; Trust","Ad hoc networks; Cryptography; Mobile computing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad-hoc security; Cryptographic; Cryptographic methods; Data transmissions; Direct interactions; Information securities; Method; Mobile ad-hoc networks; Novel methods; Path routing; Simple operations; Trust; Trust levels; Wireless networks"

This type of software may track user activities online and offline, provide targeted advertising and/or hold in other types of uninvited activities. Password collection by spywares is increasing at a shocking pace[1], The problem of entering sensitive data, such as passwords, from an untrusted machine, is obviously undesirable, however roaming users generally have no other option. They are in no point to review the security status of Internet cafe or business center machines, and has no alternative to typing the password. We consider whether it is possible to enter data to confuse spyware assumed to be running on the machine in question. The difficulty of mounting a collusion attack on a single user's password makes the problem more tractable than it might appear. This problem of password security can be improved by biometric based authentication and graphical authentication, however availability and cost of biometric authentication is considerable problem. In this paper, we present an alternative user authentication based on Images that is resistant to keylogger spywares. We have design and implemented a method that uses a strengthened cryptographic hash function to compute fast and secure passwords for arbitrarily many accounts while requiring the user to memorize only few memorable points in the image. In addition to keylogger spywares our design is also highly resistant to brute force attacks and prone to Dictionary attack, allowing users to retrieve their passwords from any location so long as they can execute our program and remember a short secret This combination of security and usability will attract users to adopt our scheme. This paper will be useful for information security researchers and practitioners who are interested in finding an alternative to spyware resistant user authentication. © 2008 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Biometrics; Computer crime; Cryptography; Internet; Security of data; Software engineering; Technical presentations; Biometric authentications; Biometric based authentications; Brute forces; Collusion attacks; Cryptographic hash functions; Dictionary attacks; Graphical authentications; Image authentications; Information securities; Internet cafes; Keylogger; Offline; Password securities; Roaming users; Secure passwords; Sensitive datums; Single users; Spyware; Spyware resistants; Spywares; Targeted advertisings; User activities; User authentications; Access control"

Consider a point-to-point communication network on which a number of information sources are mulitcast to certain sets of destination nodes. The problem is to characterize the maximum possible thruputs. Contrary to one's intuition, network coding theory reveals that it is in general not optimal to regard the information to be multicast as a ""fluid"" which can simply be routed or replicated. Rather, by employing coding at the nodes, bandwidth can in general be saved. Cai and Yeung [2] introduced the model of secure network coding which subsumes both secret sharing [3] [4] and the wiretapped channel II [5]. In this model, an information source is multicast from a source node to a set of destination nodes. A collection of subsets of the channels in the network is given, and a wiretapper is allowed to access any one (but not more than one) of these subsets without being able to obtain any information about the information source. This talk is based on the paper [2] as well as the subsequent papers [6]- [8]. In particular, we will discuss a construction of secure network codes which is optimal for the special case that the wiretapper may choose to access any subset of channels of a fixed size.","","Codes (symbols); Communication; Computer networks; Computer programming; Cryptography; Information theory; Metropolitan area networks; Multicasting; Programming theory; Wireless telecommunication systems; Coding theories; Destination nodes; Information securities; Information sources; Multicast; Network coding; Point communications; Secret sharing; Secure networks; Source nodes; Wireless communications; Wireless networks"

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the potential risks and information system (IS) security needs when outsourcing takes place and analyse the different security level in outsourcing agreements. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is primarily based on a review of the literature. International security standards and best security practices are analysed and discussed. A multiple level security framework as an effective approach in outsourcing domain is addressed. Findings: It is found that IS security risks can be effectively identified, monitored and evaluated by the concept of a layered security model that fits best in the complex outsourcing domain. There are three levels of security, first guidelines of technical security, second risk analysis and, third compliance and evaluation criteria, including managing information security. Originality/value: The approach could be used to integrate IS security with service level agreements. Outsourcing vendors with security certifications, strong security adherence systems and optimal disaster recover plans will have a competitive edge in the industry. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Data security; Information management; Outsourcing; Risk management",""

In this paper, rough set methodology is extended with a heuristic research algorithm. This algorithm, based on the discernibility matrices, integrates the frequency and significance of the attributes and the contribution rate of the rules to subjective judgment.

Malicious actions perpetrated by privileged insiders usually circumvent intrusion detection systems (IDS) and other mechanisms designed to detect and prevent unauthorized activity. In this paper, we present an architectural framework and technique to aid in situation awareness of insider threats in a networked computing environment such as a corporate network. Individual actions by users are analyzed using a theoretical model called a Capability Acquisition Graph (CAG) to evaluate their cumulative effect and detect possible violations. Our approach is based on periodic evaluation of the privileges that users accumulate with respect to critical information assets during their workflow. A static analysis tool called Information-Centric Modeler and Auditor Program (ICMAP) is used to periodically construct CAGs which are then analyzed to uncover possible attacks. The process is demonstrated by considering an information process cycle from the real-world.","Capability acquisition graph; Insider threat; Situation awareness","Computer crime; Computer systems; Data fusion; Fusion reactions; Graph theory; Information fusion; Mergers and acquisitions; Security of data; Architectural frameworks; Capability acquisition graph; Corporate networks; Critical informations; Cumulative effects; Information processes; Information securities; Insider abuses; Insider attacks; Insider threat; Insider threats; Intrusion detection systems; Networked computing; Situation awareness; Situation awarenesses; Theoretical models; Intrusion detection"

When using a steganographic approach, if an adversary suspects the existence of a hidden message the approach is defeated regardless of whether or not a plaintext is revealed. Contemporary steganography approaches found in the literature often hide data by altering a text, image, audio, etc., that serves as a cover. Although, an alteration is still considered a noise that is introduced to the cover, a sender opts to make the alterations look subtle and hard to detect, in order to avert suspicion. However, recent advances in steganalysis have rendered these approaches highly vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks such as traffic, contrast, comparison, statistical, etc., which may be able to defeat the steganographic goal. This article promotes a new paradigm for covert communication, namely noiseless steganography paradigm (Nostega), that overcomes the vulnerabilities of current approaches. Nostega neither hides data in a noise nor produces noise, rendering the generated cover noiseless. Instead, it camouflages messages in a form of unquestionable data in the generated cover. Unlike all other approaches, Nostega not only camouflages a message but also its transmission. Examples of Nostega-based steganography methodologies are discussed.","Cryptography; Information security; Steganography",""

Optical steganography, based on spread spectrum, is used to inhibit the observation of data traffic and the analysis of traffic patterns. Using optical CDMA to modulate the data, service interruption is prevented in presence of infrastructure attacks. Unlike conventional wavelength and time multiplexing approaches, the soft blocking capability of optical CDMA provides protection paths without permanently allocating bandwidth. The large size of the optical CDMA code set also reduces the probability that the secure signal can be intercepted by an eavesdropper. Finally, high-speed all-optical data encryption is demonstrated, which prevents side-channel attacks and enables real-time encryption with no delay. © 2008 IEEE.","Information security; Optical code division multiple access; Optical cryptography; Optical signal processing optical steganography","Code division multiple access; Computer networks; Cryptography; Optical data processing; Optical signal processing; Signal processing; Blocking capabilities; CDMA codes; Commercial technologies; Data networks; Data traffics; Information security; Infra structures; Large sizes; Optical code division multiple access; Optical cryptography; Optical datums; Protection paths; Service interruptions; Side-channel attacks; Spread spectrums; Traffic patterns; Security of data"

For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite-state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several types of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) representation of NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space-efficient but time-inefficient. Our goal is to find a representation of signatures that is both time and space efficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","","Computer crime; Finite automata; Information systems; Internet; Intrusion detection; Nanostructured materials; Robots; Security of data; Translation (languages); Information security; Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS); NIDS signatures; Signature matching; Space complexities; System calls; Time complexities; Automata theory"

With the increasing demand of information security and accessibility, more and more distributed systems use fingerprint identification technique as the access control. Most fingerprint recognition techniques are based on minutiae matching and have been well studied. However, this technology still suffers from problems associated with the handling of poor quality impressions. One problem besetting fingerprint matching is distortion. Distortion changes both geometric position and orientation, and leads to difficulties in establishing a match among multiple impressions acquired from the same finger tip. In this paper, according to the particularity of fingerprint distortion, we propose a combined radial basis function (RBF) model, which separately builds rigid and nonrigid transformations, for attacking the distortion problem. Combined RBF model provides more accurate mapping function between a possible matched-pair. Experiments on real data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in improving the compensation of fingerprint distortion. Also, the security and accessibility of the system using our method are further enhanced. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Most undergraduate computing students learn programming and design with little regard to security issues. To complement our security track and reach all computing students at the beginning of their studies, we piloted security integration across sections of CS0 and CS1, using a series of security laboratory modules. Preliminary results show increased security knowledge in the security-targeted sections. This paper describes the details and results of this pilot, which serves as a model for further integration throughout the CS curriculum.","Computer Science Curriculum; Information Security Curriculum Development; Security Education","Computers; Curricula; Geotechnical engineering; Integration; Programming theory; Security of data; Students; Coding techniques; Computer Science Curriculum; Computer securities; Information Security Curriculum Development; Integrating securities; Learn programmings; Security courses; Security Education; Security experts; Security issues; Security laboratories; Security tracks; Education computing"

Design/methodology/approach - A model is developed and the relationship between MISA and MATIS is tested using a large set of empirical data collected across different types and sizes of enterprises. The hypotheses of the research model are tested with regression analysis. Findings - The results of the study provide empirical support that MATIS is directly and positively related to MISA. Research limitations/implications - The R2, an estimate of the proportion of the total variation in the data set that is explained by the model, is relatively low. This fact implies that there are other constructs in addition to MISA that play a crucial role in determining MATIS. The paper suggests that intention to act and the risk-cost tradeoff of the MATIS are other possible constructs that should be incorporated into future research. The conceptual model employed as a theoretical basis also suggests that other factors such as the environment in which an organization operates (e.g. industry) also plays a major role in determining information security decisions independently of MISA. Other possible limitations include the use of secondary data in the study. Practical implications - The results indicate that developing strategies to raise an organization's MISA should impact MATIS and thus improve information security performance. Originality/value - The study provides empirical evidence supporting the unproven link between MISA and MATIS. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Data security; Information systems; Management strategy","Information systems; Regression analysis; Risk perception; Conceptual models; Cost trade-offs; Data security; Data sets; Design/methodology/approach; Developing strategies; Empirical datum; Empirical evidences; Empirical validations; Information securities; Information security awareness; Management strategy; Managerial actions; Research models; Theoretical basis; Total variations; Security of data"

Economic uncertainty, intensively collaborative work styles, virualization, increased outsourcing and ongoing compliance pressures require careful consideration and adaptation of a balanced approach. The Cyberspace Security Econometrics System (CSES) provides a measure of reliability, security and safety of a system that accounts for the criticality of each requirement as a function of one or more stakeholders' interests in that requirement. For a given stakeholder, CSES reflects the variance that may exist among the stakes one attaches to meeting each requirement. This paper summarizes the basis, objectives and capabilities for the CSES including inputs/outputs as well as the structural underpinnings.","","Benchmarking; Risk analysis; Risk management; Systems engineering; Business risks; Cyber spaces; Economic uncertainty; Information security; Key performance indicator (KPI); Network protection; Security controls; Security of data"

The proposed strategy can be applied not only to encryption and hiding of a single image, but also to multi-frame images. In the strategy, wavelet packet transform is used to decompose a carrier image into sixteen sub-band images, and eight high frequency and high entropy value of sub-images would be selected as carrier of a secret image from them. A chaotic sequence is employed to encrypt a secret image. And then the encrypted image is decomposed into eight bit planes. After impact factors of the bit planes are selected, the bit planes would separately be superimposed on the eight sub-band images in accordance with entropy values of the sub-images and information amount of the bit planes. Finally, the carrier image embedded the secret image is reconstructed using wavelet packet inverse transform. Experimental results show the approach is able to not only maintain fidelity of the carrier image, but also ensure security and safety of the secret image. Therefore, the approach can be applied to information security and crypto-communication of images in many fields, such as medical, commercial and military and so on. © 2008 IEEE.","Bit planes decomposition; Chaotic sequence; Image encryption; Image hiding; Wavelet packet decomposition","Civil aviation; Cryptography; Image enhancement; Mobile computing; Packet networks; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Bit planes decomposition; Chaotic sequence; Image encryption; Image hiding; Wavelet packet decomposition; Military photography"
