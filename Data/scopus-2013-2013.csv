Knowledge of timing alone can reveal to an adversary the nature of users? online behavior, including, but not restricted to, Web sites accessed, recipients of e-mails and chat messages, financial resources considered, and more. It is imperative that current network protocols be redesigned to prevent the retrieval of packet timing in a network and limit the ?networking? information inferable from the timing. Timing information can be retrieved by adversaries both passive and active: active adversaries masquerade as network users and retrieve the timing of other legitimate users using delays experienced at shared schedulers, while passive adversaries utilize sophisticated snooping equipment to detect timing without actively participating in the network. In this article, a signal processing perspective is presented to study the protection against each kind of adversary, and a path to a unified solution to prevent timing analysis is discussed. Such unified scheduling strategies are shown to require a limited transmission of ?dummy? packets to obfuscate the information retrieved by any adversary. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","","Network protocols; Scheduling; Security of data; Timing circuits; Financial resources; Legitimate users; Network operations; Passive adversary; Scheduling strategies; Statistical inference; Timing information; Unified solutions; Signal processing"

The modernization of the grid to accommodate today's uses is leading to the incorporation of information processing capabilities for power system controls and operations monitoring. The ""Smart Grid"" is the name given to the evolving electric power network as new information technology systems and capabilities are incorporated. While these new components may add to the ability to control power flows and enhance the efficiency of grid operations, they also potentially increase the susceptibility of the grid to cyber (i.e., computer-related) attack since they are built around microprocessor devices whose basic functions are controlled by software programming. The potential for a major disruption or widespread damage to the nation's power system from a large scale cyberattack has increased focus on the cybersecurity of the Smart Grid. Federal efforts to enhance the cybersecurity of the electrical grid were emphasized with the recognition of cybersecurity as a critical issue for electric utilities in developing the Smart Grid. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) received primary responsibility for the reliability of the bulk power system from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. FERC subsequently designated the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as the ""Electric Reliability Organization"" (ERO) with the responsibility of establishing and enforcing reliability standards. Compliance with reliability standards for electric utilities thus changed from a voluntary, peer-driven undertaking to a mandatory function. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) later added requirements for ""a reliable and secure electricity infrastructure"" with regard to Smart Grid development. NERC is also responsible for standards for critical infrastructure protection (CIP) which focus on planning and procedures for the physical security of the grid. Self-determination is a key part of the CIP reliability process. Utilities are allowed to self-identify what they see as ""critical assets"" under NERC regulations. Only ""critical cyber assets"" (i.e., as essential to the reliable operation of critical assets) are subject to CIP standards. FERC has directed NERC to revise the standards so that some oversight of the identification process for critical cyber assets was provided, but any revision is again subject to stakeholder approval. While reliability standards are mandatory, the ERO process for developing regulations is somewhat unusual in that the regulations are essentially being established by the entities who are being regulated. This may potentially be a conflict of interest, especially when cost of compliance is a concern, and acceptable standards may conceivably result from the option with the lowest costs. Since utility systems are interconnected in many ways, the system with the least protected network potentially provides the weakest point of access. Cybersecurity threats represent a constantly moving and increasing target for mitigation activities and mitigation efforts could likewise spiral upward in costs. Recovery of costs may present a major challenge especially to distribution utilities and state commissions charged with overseeing utility costs. EISA only requires states to consider recovery of costs related to Smart Grid systems. FERC has jurisdiction over the bulk power grid, and cannot compel entities involved in distribution to comply with its regulations. Recoverability from a cyber attack on the scale of something which could take down a significant portion of the grid will likely be very difficult, but maintaining a ready inventory of critical spare parts in close proximity to key installations could quicken recovery efforts from some types of attack. The electricity grid is connected to (and largely dependent on) the natural gas pipeline, water supply, and telecommunications systems. Technologies being developed for use by the Smart Grid could also be used by these industries. Consideration could be given to applying similar control system device and system safeguards to these other critical utility systems. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","Computer programming; Computer system recovery; Costs; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Natural gas pipelines; Power control; Recovery; Regulatory compliance; Reliability; Smart power grids; Standards; Water supply; Critical infrastructure protection; Distribution utilities; Electric power networks; Electricity infrastructure; Energy independence and security act of 2007; Federal energy regulatory commissions; Information processing capability; Information technology systems; Electric power system control"

Compare this discussion to a long-since established field such as medicine. We would not expect to see medical journals discussing the need for accreditation and a greater quantification of professionalism. This presents the IA field with decidedly greater opportunities to chart its course for the future. Those professionals working in the field today have the chance to shape the future direction of their profession and their own careers.

With most embedded devices getting connected to the Internet, the information risk due to its value, and the risk associated with information storage, transfer, and duplication is high. The critical aspect of this information in the embedded world is that the majority of this information has a direct impact on the physical world. For example, consider an Internet-enabled control system that has access to the information acquired from the sensors; this information can be used to manipulate, undo, or modify the operating conditions of the system, and would have a significant impact on the physical world. In the past, the embedded systems, due to its isolated existence, had less worries on the need for trust and information security. The access to the embedded devices was usually restricted and different from the microprocessor pathway. However, beginning in 2009, this scenario started changing mainly because embedded devices are becoming Internet enabled, resulting in evolution of different communication pathways to access the information and the devices. The trust in the modern embedded solutions faces the challenges of multicore computing capabilities, increasing overlap with general computing architectures, and data analytic-aware computing hardware. In this chapter, we provide a modern perspective on the trust issues in embedded computing and devices. In addition, it should be noted that there is a high level of trust placed in many mission critical applications that use embedded systems. This makes this topic highly relevant and of prime importance for ensuring the robustness of embedded computing solutions in the future. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Computer architecture; Digital storage; Security of data; Communication pathways; Computing architecture; Computing hardware; Embedded computing; Information risk; Mission critical applications; Multi-core computing; Operating condition; Embedded systems"

Unlike a clinical operations, where access is very well defined, research data often have to be browsed in novel ways to devise a hypothesis. Such browsing of data requires the execution of queries that are novel and ideally require an on-demand integration of different data modalities. For example, a researcher, who is developing new algorithms to help craft tighter dose margins, will want to explore the planning computed tomography (CT), the radiotherapy (RT) dose and structures, patient diagnosis, and outcome data. To test their algorithms, the researcher may want to retrieve RT structures and possibly the associated planning CT, given a particular diagnosis, dose, and outcome. Most existing systems will have a hard time executing a query where some of the queryable attributes are in the electronic medical records (diagnosis and outcome) and a RT PACS (dose), whereas the objects of interest are in a RT PACS (structure) and radiology PACS (planning CT). From these examples, it becomes evident that existing clinical systems fall short when it comes to research use cases. Next, we explore some specific research data management systems, the benefits of a service-oriented architecture in facilitating data federation, and finally information security. © 2014 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","",""

The electricity infrastructure of the United States is aging, and uncertainty exists around how to modernize the grid, and what technologies and fuels will be used to produce electricity in the future. Congress will likely be faced with policy issues regarding how the modernization of this vital industry will unfold. For most of the 20th century, coal has been the dominant fuel used to produce electricity. In 2011, coal was the fuel used for almost 42% of power generation in the United States. However, coal use for power generation seems to be on the decline. In April 2012, for the first time in history, the amount of electricity generated from natural gas equaled that of coal (according to Energy Information Administration statistics) with each fuel claiming about 32% of the market. The future of coal as a fuel for power generation seems to be in question. Two major reasons are generally seen as being responsible: the expectation of a dramatic rise in natural gas supplies, and the impact of environmental regulations on an aging base of coalfired power plants. The electric utility industry values diversity in fuel choice options since reliance on one fuel or technology can leave electricity producers vulnerable to price and supply volatility. However, an ""inverse relationship"" is developing for coal vs. natural gas as a power generation choice based on market economics alone, and policies which allow one fuel source to dominate may come at the detriment of the other. Upgrading the nation's transmission system to accommodate current and future uses, and ensuring the reliable functioning and the security of the grid, has been a major concern for the federal government. Federal law has already tasked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with responsibility for enforcing reliability standards for the bulk electric system, including cybersecurity, but protection from natural hazards continues as a key issue. The recent damage sustained to the electrical grid by Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey and difficulty in restoring electricity service underscore the age and fragility of the power system, and how electricity service might benefit from hardening and modernization of various power systems. Growing concerns over greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, other environmental costs associated with burning fossil fuels, and existing or anticipated state and federal policies addressing these issues are leading some utilities and energy providers to deploy more renewable energy technologies to meet power demands, and potentially increasing the need for new transmission lines to incorporate clean energy sources. New environmental regulations under development would impose new requirements on coal-fired power plants. Some of these rules would be implemented at the federal level, while others would be implemented at the state level. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also issued standards for greenhouse gas emissions which would require all new power plants to restrict carbon dioxide emissions. EPA has yet to propose rules for GHG emissions from existing power plants, as is required by court order. Much attention has focused on the resulting finalization of these regulations, and their potential to contribute to power plant retirements, with some in the electric power industry expressing concern that reliability could be impacted. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","Age hardening; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Commerce; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hurricanes; Laws and legislation; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Plants (botany); Renewable energy resources; Carbon dioxide emissions; Coal-fired power plant; Electric power industries; Electric utility industry; Electricity infrastructure; Energy Information Administration; Federal energy regulatory commissions; Renewable energy technologies; Electric power transmission networks"

The investigation of available spectrum band by the secondary users is called spectrum sensing; a core mechanism mandatory for the true operation of CRs. Security of spectrum sensing process needs a lot of focus. Information security in the control channel is dependent upon the authentication surety of cognitive radio network that are used for the exchange of the information on the free primary channels. So, if the channel sensing is unsecure then occurrence of interference or the preemption of resources for long can take place. This uncertainty is often due to a serious threat of Primary User Emulation Attack (PUEA) in which the attacker confuses the CR, by mimicking the characteristics of a Primary User (PU) to gain illegal access to the spectrum. This is a great threat to control channel authenticity. We have proposed a technique of pooled methodology to mitigate the effect of this attack by employing a combined effect of energy detection and feature detection. With the help of simulations the effectiveness of our scheme is established in terms of higher probability of false detections in case of energy detection scheme and lower in case of pooled methodology for the security establishment. © 2013 SDIWC.","Cognitive radio network; Energy detection; Pooled methodology; Primary user emulation attack; Security","Information science; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Radio; Radio systems; Secure communication; Security of data; Signal detection; Cognitive radio network; Energy detection; Pooled methodology; Primary user emulation attack (PUEA); Security; Cognitive radio"

The analysis focuses on information security, organization set-up and potential development of the platforms, contributing with empirical findings and conceptual applications. A key finding was that the organization of identification and access to public e-services seemed highly dependent of the organizational structure of the public schools.

In this empirical study, we used an inter-regional input–output table in order to analyze both sectoral and regional interdependencies under the influence of information technology and the information security of Japanese firms. Our analysis showed that the economic scale of a region has a great influence on the characteristics of the interdependency. Furthermore, we found that the demand-side sectors can be classified into five classes based on the characteristics. Among them, the groups with high self-dependency get more benefits from simultaneous understanding of regional characteristics; for the sectors in these classes, investment advice obtained from sectoral characteristics only is very limited, whereas they can obtain much more from regional characteristics. Since these classes include a majority of the sectors, we can recognize the importance of regional interdependency analysis. In the above basic study, what we see is the situation before the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011.As an extended study, we estimated the impact of the earthquake on the interdependency. Our main finding from the regional perspective is that the interdependency characteristics of the most damaged region (Tohoku) and of the economically largest region (Kanto) are impacted most significantly.

They play an important role in the development of more effective communication between technical and nontechnical participants than that made possible by text. Recently, Unifi ed Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagrams have been used to model security attacks (e.g. collision attacks and unintelligent replay attacks) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs require protection to preserve the confi dentiality and integrity of sensitive information as well as availability of the system. This is an important research issue because WSNs are used in critical applications such as military battlefi eld surveillance, industrial process monitoring and control, and machine health monitoring. This paper describes an alternative fl ow-based approach for visualizing security attacks in terms of depiction of behavioral interactions. It models security attacks in WSNs and contrasts this method with the sequence-based diagrammatic method. The comparison provides an initial appraisal of the technique with reference to a well-known process modeling methodology. The results indicate that the method can capture the interweaving of attack events to achieve a more complete and detailed picture necessary for better understanding. © 2013 WIT Press.","Collision attacks; Conceptual model; Information security; Security requirements; UML sequence diagram; Visualization; Wireless sensor networks","Cryptography; Flow visualization; Industrial research; Military applications; Modeling languages; Network security; Positive ions; Process monitoring; Security of data; Collision attack; Conceptual model; Effective communication; Industrial process monitoring; Machine health monitoring; Security requirements; UML sequence diagrams; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); comparative study; conceptual framework; data quality; graphical method; information and communication technology; information management; mobile communication; safety; sensor; visualization; Wireless sensor networks"

The Parallel Sub-Pipelined architecture (PSP) is proposed in order to obtain high throughput. The proposed architecture is also compared with loop unrolled, pipelined, sub-pipelined, parallel and parallel pipelined architecture in terms of throughput. The AES algorithm using Parallel Sub-Pipelined architecture was prototyped in FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit).The proposed architecture yielded a throughput of 59.59 Gbps at a frequency of 450.045 MHz on FPGA Virtex XC6VLX75T which is higher than the throughput yielded in other architectures.

Even now, mathematics continues to be the common language of science. Furthermore, even more than in the past, mathematics today plays the role of a compass by indicating the directions that research in science and technology should follow. Without mathematics, progress in all fields could only be made by blind exploration. In fact, we find mathematics at the heart of nearly all the advanced technologies that drive modern society, including information security, networks, medical technology such as CT scans and MRIs, control in chemical plants, blast furnaces, and nuclear reactors, the development of airplanes and automobiles, design in robotics, scheduling in transportation, logistics in industries, finance and insurance, risk management, searching for resources, weather and earthquake prediction, and entertainment, etc. No matter how different these fields are in appearance, many of them have identical structures in terms of their mathematics. This is frequently acknowledged as &#x201C;the universality and the general applicability of mathematics.&#x201D; They are major characteristics of mathematics. For example, while it is a fact that the designs of CT scanners, MRI, and the control of blast furnaces for manufacturing iron each entail difficulties unique to their respective fields, mathematically, each involves the same activity&#x2014;the solution of an inverse problem. &#x00A9; 2013, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Blast Furnace; Casimir Force; Information Security; Lattice Reduction Algorithm; Riemann Hypothesis",""

It introduces new directions for the interoperability between the components of a communication system. Coding and cryptography are standard components in today’s distributed systems. The integration of cryptography into coding aspects is very interesting, as the usage of cryptography will be common use, even in industrial applications. The book is based on new developments of coding and cryptography, which use real numbers to express reliability values of bits instead of binary values 0 and 1. The presented methods are novel and designed for noisy communication, which doesn’t allow the successful use of cryptography. The rate of successful verifications is improved essentially not only for standard or “hard” verification, but even more after the introduction of “soft” verification. A security analysis shows the impact on the security. Information security and cryptography follow the late developments of communication theory by changing from “hard” to “soft”, which results in much better results. © 2013 Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag GmbH.","","Codes (symbols); Information theory; Interoperability; Network security; Security of data; Binary values; Distributed systems; Real number; Reliability values; Robust communication; Security analysis; Standard components; Synergetic effect; Cryptography"

Good in theory, but JWG B5-D2.46 discovered significant management challenges to effectively administer a highly distributed schema for vetting protection and control access privileges and use privileges in a timely manner. A summary of JWG’s findings is discussed in this paper. A world-wide survey of EPU protection and control (P&C) engineers helped JWG rank the challenges they faced to apply and manage cybersecurity solutions – RBAC management was high on the list. Further analysis by the JWG identified the core issues of trust in the vetting process for employees, suppliers and partners. Maintaining a coherent database of access and use privileges in this heterogeneous environment proved to be labor intensive and not timely to the rapidly changing roles of P&C engineers and field technicians. System dynamic modeling highlighted these deficiencies and provides the basis for JWG’s recommended improvements to effectively administer RBAC.

However, despite severe budget constraints, military demands for highly dynamic federated mission are still increasing especially toward Information Technology (IT). This introduces new challenges for organizations. They are moving from a device-centric view of IT toward a view that is application, people, and information centric. Military organizations are not excluded from this new process which is the fundament of a new theory called Network Enabled Capability (NEC). In addition, the requirements of timeliness, accuracy, ubiquity, assurance and security, rapid exchange of information in the battlefield across all pieces and organizations are the leverage to accomplish the military mission and fundamental for the command and control process also defined with the Observe, Orient, Decide, Act cycle (OODA). Cloud Computing aligns, on one hand, with this new world view and challenges, as the existing infrastructures can be used more efficiently and expanded quicker and leverage the implementation of NEC in the military operations where concepts like information assurance, information sharing, flexibility and scalability are getting more and more important. On the other hand it raises new threats and issues such as the erosion of trust boundaries, ubiquitous connectivity, the amorphous nature of information interchange, the ineffectiveness of traditional static security controls, and the dynamic nature of Cloud services. All this requires new thinking and a new knowledge management approach. However, the new service models, operational models and new technology employed to enable the implementation of Cloud Computing may present different risks and additional requirements to the organization. Especially military specific requirements and priorities need to be considered when moving towards tactical Collaborative Cloud. The information exchange requirements in the military operation/mission are growing and getting more complex. In addition security mechanisms and processes often hamper the mission to keep pace with the environmental conditions. Methods such as Reach Back or Home Base clarify that also the military perimeter has changed and modern Command, Control and Information System (CCIS) are best practice for Cloud Computing. This chapter will describe the landscape of Cloud Computing and will focus the view on the possibility of implementing this new concept in the military world. The strengths and the weakness that the implementation of Cloud Computing can introduce in the military operations will be highlighted. In addition, an analysis on what Cloud Computing introduces in the NEC is presented as a starting point for future and more specific studies. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.","Cloud Computing; Cloud Infrastructure; Cloud Service; Military Operation; Private Cloud",""

By looking at 292 vulnerability reports for Mozilla, 66 for Apache, and 21 for Tomcat, we find that the number of people committing vulnerability fixes changes proportionally to the number of vulnerability fixes for Mozilla and Tomcat, but not for Apache httpd.Our findings do not support the hypothesis that vulnerability fix rates decline. It seems as if the supply of easily fixable vulnerabilities is not running out and returns are not diminishing (yet).Additionally, software security has traditionally been viewed as an arms race between attackers and defenders. Recent work in an unrelated field has produced precise mathematical models for such arms races, but again the evidence we find is scant and does not support the hypothesis of an arms race (of this kind). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","","Apache tomcats; Cyber security; Economic models; Mozilla; Number of peoples; Security investments; Software security; Software vulnerabilities; Economics"

Using regression analysis, variables influencing information security investments were found. External environmental factors have no significant effect on enterprises information security investment. Variables that can predict ""information security investment"" by the order of beta coefficients are: ""the senior executives' attitude toward control of information security,"" ""information security risk index,"" ""the scale of enterprise,"" and ""the degree of enterprises' technology application."" Consequently, enterprises need to empower the top management to control information security and risk perception to improve the quality of information security decision making.

Despite government efforts to limit the flow of online news, Chinese Internet users are able to access unprecedented amounts of information, and political activists have utilized the Web as a vital communications tool. In recent years, Twitter-like microblogging has surged, resulting in dramatic cases of dissident communication and public comment on sensitive political issues. However, the Web has proven to be less of a democratic catalyst in China than many observers had hoped. The PRC government has one of the most rigorous Internet censorship systems, which relies heavily upon cooperation between the government and private Internet companies. Some U.S. policy makers have been especially critical of the compliance of some U.S. Internet communications and technology (ICT) companies with China's censorship and policing activities. The development of the Internet and its use in China have raised U.S. congressional concerns, including those related to human rights, trade and investment, and cybersecurity. The link between the Internet and human rights, a pillar of U.S. foreign policy towards China, is the main focus of this report. Congressional interest in the Internet in China is tied to human rights concerns in a number of ways. These include the following: • The use of the Internet as a U.S. policy tool for promoting freedom of expression and other rights in China, • The use of the Internet by political dissidents in the PRC, and the political repression that such use often provokes, • The role of U.S. Internet companies in both spreading freedom in China and complying with PRC censorship and social control efforts, and • The development of U.S. Internet freedom policies globally. Since 2006, congressional committees and commissions have held nine hearings on Internet freedom and related issues, with a large emphasis on China. In response to criticism, in 2008, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google, and other parties founded the Global Network Initiative, a set of guidelines that promotes awareness, due diligence, and transparency regarding the activities of ICT companies and their impacts on human rights, particularly in countries where governments frequently violate the rights of Internet users to freedom of expression and privacy. In the 112th Congress, the Global Online Freedom Act (H.R. 3605) would require U.S. companies to disclose any censorship or surveillance technology that they provide to Internet-restricting countries. It also would bar U.S. companies from selling technology that could be used for the purposes of censorship or surveillance in such countries. For over a decade, the United States government has sought to promote global Internet freedom, particularly in China and Iran. In 2006, the Bush Administration established the Global Internet Freedom Task Force, which was renamed the NetFreedom Task Force under the Obama Administration. Congress provided $95 million for global Internet freedom programs between 2008 and 2012. The Broadcasting Board of Governors has spent approximately $2 million annually during the past decade to help enable Internet users in China and other Internet- restricting countries to access its websites, such as Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Some experts argue that support for counter-censorship technology, which has long dominated the U.S. effort to promote global Internet freedom, has had an important but limited impact. Obstacles to Internet freedom in China and elsewhere include not only censorship but also the following: advances in government capabilities to monitor and attack online dissident activity; tight restrictions on social networking; and the lack of popular pressure for greater Internet freedom. As part of a broadening policy approach, the U.S. government has sponsored a widening range of Internet freedom programs, including censorship circumvention technology; privacy protection and online security; training civil society groups in effective uses of the Web for communications, organizational, and advocacy purposes; and spreading awareness of Internet freedom. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The argument for teaching ethical hacking focuses on the need for students to understand attacks to better prepare these students for stopping such attacks. However, some believe that teaching hacking skills increases risk to society by drawing students into activities and behaviors that ultimately lead them to commit criminal acts. The proponents of teaching ethical hacking argue that ethics is in the name of these courses and ethics training permeates related curriculum providing students with ample preparation to understand the risks of related criminal activities thereby leading students toward healthy behaviors. This paper stems from an effort to explore mechanisms beyond classroom-based curriculum to minimize the risk of students committing criminal acts with the skills acquired in an ethical hacking class. The data collection for this paper included interviewing more than 200 information security professionals at three professional conferences focusing on information security in the Southwestern United States. Each respondent was given an overview of a typical ethical hacking program and was asked if they believed ethical hacking should be taught in universities, and if so, what mechanisms should be in place to help students refrain from criminal activity.

By using collected data from a survey that we conducted, and employing a stepwise logit model, we analyze the relationships above. The primary results are as follows: First of all, myopic cognition and hyperopic cognition measured by the CFC scale have effects on the behaviors of violating organizational rules in almost all cases. Next, in many cases, individuals whose information security awareness is higher tend not to violate the rules. Third, the behavior of violating the rules is independent of the size of the organization, and is not related to the degree of workplace satisfaction and the evaluation toward the managers in some cases. Fourth, in an organization in which permanent employment is implemented, individuals tend to violate the rules. It is not easy to control psychological factors such as an individual’s attitude toward risk. Conversely, the factors regarded as organizational attributes, such as the degree of workplace satisfaction or the employment system utilized, may be controlled by designing the appropriate organizational environment. Consequently, we consider that it may be effective to improve information security awareness by information security education and training. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","","Empirical studies; Information security awareness; Information security education; Logit modeling; Psychological factors; Security of data"

The aim of this work is to develop a method for assessing the security of information processed in the information system based on controlled multistage decision-making processes that enhance the efficiency of information security, taking into account the characteristics of the process of protection. To achieve this goal it is necessary to determine the value of risk at each stage of the protection process and generally determine the choice of security means that minimize the importance of risk at all stages. Evaluation process of information systems protection and the process of security means implementation in phases. At each phase a set of data on the security system state is obtained. It depends on the implemented security services that characterize the security system state and influence the choice of protective mechanisms used. The paper defines the vectors of the evaluation process of security and protection application process to ensure risk values minimization at all stages of the system protection. Value (8) and (9) along with the rule of protective measures usage (7) determine the procedure for selecting the optimal measures to protect the full statistical description of the system. These expressions are the basis for finding optimal or similar to these algorithms of the security means usage in case of apriority uncertainty.

It examines the role of three important actors involved in the internet governance arena, namely governments, private sector and civil society, and how they have influenced the debate. To this end, this paper analyses how different organisations, industry and societal actors see cyber security and how their interests influence the way the debate has evolved. The difficult balance between security and fundamental rights, although not new to governments and society, is of great importance for the internet. Citizens have engaged in favour of an open internet. However, little attention has been paid to the demands of citizens and how they may contribute to a concept of cyber security that brings society to its core. The paper states that for cyberspace to be open and supportive of innovation, the practice of cyber security needs to internalise the interests and perspectives of end users. A multistakeholder approach to cyber security asks a more participative environment where the rules of the game are decided with public participation and consultation, giving citizens the means and methods to influence the way cyber security is conceived and implemented. The paper concludes that although a citizen centric approach towards cyber security should be the way forward, this seems to be yet far from being included in the governmental agenda.

Because almost every aspect of an enterprise is now dependent on technology, the focus of IT security must shift from locking down assets to enabling the business while managing and surviving risk. This compact book discusses business risk from a broader perspective, including privacy and regulatory considerations. It describes the increasing number of threats and vulnerabilities, but also offers strategies for developing solutions. These include discussions of how enterprises can take advantage of new and emerging technologies-such as social media and the huge proliferation of Internet-enabled devices-while minimizing risk. With ApressOpen, content is freely available through multiple online distribution channels and electronic formats with the goal of disseminating professionally edited and technically reviewed content to the worldwide community. Here are some of the responses from reviewers of this exceptional work: ""Managing Risk and Information Security is a perceptive, balanced, and often thought-provoking exploration of evolving information risk and security challenges within a business context. Harkins clearly connects the needed, but often-overlooked linkage and dialog between the business and technical worlds and offers actionable strategies. The book contains eye-opening security insights that are easily understood, even by the curious layman."" Fred Wettling, Bechtel Fellow, IS&T Ethics & Compliance Officer, Bechtel ""As disruptive technology innovations and escalating cyber threats continue to create enormous information security challenges, Managing Risk and Information Security: Protect to Enable provides a much-needed perspective. This book compels information security professionals to think differently about concepts of risk management in order to be more effective. The specific and practical guidance offers a fast-track formula for developing information security strategies which are lock-step with business priorities."" Laura Robinson, Principal, Robinson Insight Chair, Security for Business Innovation Council (SBIC) Program Director, Executive Security Action Forum (ESAF) ""The mandate of the information security function is being completely rewritten. Unfortunately most heads of security haven't picked up on the change, impeding their companies' agility and ability to innovate. This book makes the case for why security needs to change, and shows how to get started. It will be regarded as marking the turning point in information security for years to come."" Dr. Jeremy Bergsman, Practice Manager, CEB ""The world we are responsible to protect is changing dramatically and at an accelerating pace. Technology is pervasive in virtually every aspect of our lives. Clouds, virtualization and mobile are redefining computing - and they are just the beginning of what is to come. Your security perimeter is defined by wherever your information and people happen to be. We are attacked by professional adversaries who are better funded than we will ever be. We in the information security profession must change as dramatically as the environment we protect. We need new skills and new strategies to do our jobs effectively. We literally need to change the way we think. Written by one of the best in the business, Managing Risk and Information Security challenges traditional security theory with clear examples of the need for change. It also provides expert advice on how to dramatically increase the success of your security strategy and methods - from dealing with the misperception of risk to how to become a Z-shaped CISO. Managing Risk and Information Security is the ultimate treatise on how to deliver effective security to the world we live in for the next 10 years. It is absolute must reading for anyone in our profession - and should be on the desk of every CISO in the world."" Dave Cullinane, CISSP CEO Security Starfish, LLC ""In this overview, Malcolm Harkins delivers an insightful survey of the trends, threats, and tactics shaping information risk and security.

Design/methodology/approachInterpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and MICMAC approaches have been used to identify and classify the key factors of information security management based on the direct and indirect relationship of these factors. FindingsThe research presents a classification of key parameters according to their driving power and dependence which enable information security management in an organization. It also suggests parameters on which management should pay more attention. Research limitations/implicationsIn the paper, 12 parameters were identified based on a literature study and expert help. It is possible to identify some more parameters for ISM development. The help of experts was also used to identify the contextual relationship among the variables for the ISM model. This may introduce some element of bias. Although a relationship model using ISM has been developed, it has not been validated statistically. For future research, it is suggested that the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique may be used to corroborate the findings of ISM. Some of the variables have been grouped together, being a part of a subset due to their similar nature; but it is possible to treat them as independent variables. Future researches may establish their interrelationships also. Practical implicationsThe paper has tremendous practical utility for organizations which want to reap the benefits of information and communication technology for their growth but are struggling to find a right approach to deal with information security breach incidents. Originality/valueDevelopment of a framework for information security management in an organization is the major contribution of this paper. This would be of help to strategic managers in managing information security with emphasis on key parameters identified here. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","India; Information security; Information security management; Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM); Key variables; MICMAC; Organizations",""

One cyber security vision is the cyber immune system. Such a system would include automatic defense mechanisms based on incomplete attribution, continuous monitoring, pattern recognition, and the application of a set of rules designed to isolate or destroy the abnormal actor, or attacker. The cyber immune system would operate at a distributed level, at the speed necessary to thwart constant and ever changing threats. From a legal perspective, it matters if a state or private entity applies the system. For example, if a state actor is involved, then due process, and the protection of fundamental rights such as privacy and speech, are relevant to the action taken, while if a private entity applies the cyber defense then relevant legal issues include property, contract, and regulatory limits. While the automated nature of a cyber defense may present legal challenges to both state and non-state actors, it may mitigate the legal ramifications of human decision making if the system of rules is carefully crafted. © 2013 NATO Coop Cyber Def Ctr.","cybersecurity; law; privacy; property; speech","Data privacy; Immune system; Network security; Pattern recognition systems; Speech; Continuous monitoring; Cyber security; Defense mechanism; Human decision making; law; Legal ramifications; property; Regulatory limit; Laws and legislation"

While previous research has mostly focused on economic models for security investments, or on how to quantify the benefits of information security, this chapter aims to take a closer look at the costs of information security. After providing the reader with basic knowledge and motivation for the topic, we identify and describe the problems and difficulties in quantifying an enterprise’s cost for information security in a comprehensive and comparable way. Of these issues, the lack of a common model of costs of information security is the most prominent one. This chapter also discusses four approaches to categorize and determine the costs of information security in an enterprise. Starting with the classic approach frequently used in surveys, we continue by describing three alternative approaches. To support research on the costs of information security we propose two metrics.

The paper also suggests a set of approaches for improving SDSC in a society and demonstrates using a case study how the suggested approaches could be integrated to compose a plan for improving SDSC. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.","Information security; Security culture; Security usability","Losses; Risk management; Digital security; Financial loss; Information and Communication Technologies; Security usabilities; Security vulnerabilities; Technical security; Technical solutions; Security of data"

We discuss the traditional practices of information security models in the banking sector and how these models have been significantly improved by the use of biometrics and more specifically by the use of IRT. The advantages associated with the use of IRT amongst other biometric technologies are analyzed and justified. A case study is presented, based on in-depth semi-structured interviews with key decision makers of Cairo Amman Bank (CAB) in Jordan; the first bank in the world that has implemented a full roll-out of IRT-enabled services, through which issues and challenges associated with the adoption of IRT in the banking industry are thoroughly analyzed and examined. Based on the findings, the critical success factors for implementing iris scanning technologies in the banking sector are identified and discussed. Finally, analysis of business value and benefits captured as a result of adopting IRT by banks are discussed.","Banking; Biometrics; Business Value.; Iris Recognition; Iris Scanning; Security; Technology Differentiation; Visionary Leadership","Information systems; Security of data; Banking; Business value; Iris recognition; Iris scanning; Security; Visionary Leadership; Biometrics"

HT detection techniques are badly needed to ensure trust in hardware systems. In related works, only a fixed large number of random patterns are applied, with no regard to the pattern's effect to HT detection result. The variations in target signal caused by different sets of input vectors are not addressed. There is also no guarantee that the vector set used is long enough to be representative or whether it is already over testing. To solve these problems, we propose a Monte Carlo based test pattern generation method for HT detection. The proposed approach offers a solution by sampling the detection until the standard deviation of the measured signal over all the samples is within certain accuracy. This gives us the confidence in the signal measurement without having to do exhaustive test. Moreover, it is conducive to simplify test vector sets. Experiment results on ISCAS89 benchmarks showed that the proposed approach usually needs much less time than that required by exhaustive test to achieve reliable results and desired accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.","hardware security; hardware Trojan detection; information security; Monte Carlo technique; test pattern generation","Hardware; Monte Carlo methods; Security of data; Hardware security; Hardware Trojan detection; Hardware Trojans; Measured signals; Monte Carlo techniques; Signal measurement; Standard deviation; Test pattern generations; Signal detection"

To minimize the communication delay, these systems require fast mechanisms for massive document comparison. Bloom filters have been proven to be a fast tool for membership checkup with some allowed level of false positive errors. Taking into account specific needs of fast text comparison this paper proposes modifications to the Matrix Bloom filters. Approach proposed in this paper allows to improve density in Matrix Bloom filters with the help of special index to track documents uploaded into the system. Density is improved by combining a few documents in one line of the matrix to reduce the filter size and to address the problem of document removal.

Based on interviews in four countries, we argue that while information security behaviors are learned, different paradigms of learning are effective in different cultures; i.e., different cultures require different IS security interventions. What is even more important is that by providing non-preferred IS security interventions (e.g., monitoring/sanctions in Switzerland) were negative for improving information security. This study has implications for IS security research, editors, and practitioners. For scholars, we urge them to not only validate, but also test their models in different countries. The implication for editors is the need to re-consider their reviewing policy and accept papers that also show the limits of their model (not positive results) in some countries.

In order to understand how to manage those threats, it is important to examine reasons why organisational employees fall victim to social engineering. In this paper, the objective is to understand security behaviours in practice by investigating factors that may cause an individual to comply with a request posed by a perpetrator. In order to attain this objective, we collect data through a scenario-based survey and conduct phishing experiments in three organisations. The results from the experiment reveal that the degree of target information in an attack increases the likelihood that an organisational employee fall victim to an actual attack. Further, an individual's trust and risk behaviour significantly affects the actual behaviour during the phishing experiment. Computer experience at work, helpfulness and gender (females tend to be less susceptible to a generic attack than men), has a significant correlation with behaviour reported by respondents in the scenario-based survey. No correlation between the performance in the scenario-based survey and experiment was found. We argue that the result does not imply that one or the other method should be ruled out as they have both advantages and disadvantages which should be considered in the context of collecting data in the critical domain of information security.

The scheme not only satisfies the mutual authentication between the user and service provider, but also presents higher security and lower computational cost than traditional schemes based OTP. © 2013 IEEE.","Identity authentication; Infinite hash chain; One-time password","Internet; Security of data; Authentication scheme; Computational costs; Hash chains; Identity authentication; Mutual authentication; One-time passwords; Service provider; Two factor authentication; Authentication"

A total of 203 employees, from three large Australian government organisations, completed a web-based questionnaire designed to capture the knowledge, attitude and behaviour of individuals in regard to InfoSec. In conjunction with this employee questionnaire, qualitative interviews were conducted with a small number of senior management employees from each of the three organisations. Overall, the questionnaire results indicated that employees from all three organisations had reasonable levels of awareness of InfoSec vulnerabilities. Analysis of the qualitative interviews revealed that management not only had an accurate understanding of their employees' InfoSec awareness, but were able to recognise vulnerable areas that required further attention and improvement, such as the appropriate use of wireless technology, the reporting of security incidents and the use of social networking sites.","Information risk; Information security (InfoSec); InfoSec awareness; InfoSec behaviour; InfoSec vulnerabilities","Human resource management; Mobile security; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Wireless telecommunication systems; Information risk; InfoSec awareness; InfoSec behaviour; InfoSec vulnerabilities; Security vulnerabilities; Social networking sites; Use of wireless technology; Web-based questionnaires; Security of data"

The ubiquity of social technologies makes employees' professional and personal boundaries unclear, allowing inadvertent leakage of organizational information through the public domain. Without proper information security management, social media could be a double-edged sword to organizations. Hence, some organizations are employing various security strategies to mitigate employees' use of these social platforms. While cases of information leakage through OSN have been reported worldwide, its coverage in academic literature is scant. This paper aims to fill in this research gap. It reports the findings of a qualitative multiple-case study to unravel information security issues that OSN might bring to organizations. It also describes the security strategies employed by organizations and factors that influenced the strategy decision. The understanding of this contemporary phenomenon and organizational security strategy contributes to the development of a theoretical framework that may offer practical insight to organizations.","Information leakage; Information security management; Online social networking; Social media","Industrial management; Mobile security; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Information leakage; Information security managements; Multiple-case study; Online social networkings; Online social networkings (OSN); Organizational information; Social media; Theoretical framework; Social networking (online)"

Previous work has extensively studied the use of fake (Sybil) accounts that attackers set up to distribute spam messages (mostly messages that contain links to scam pages or drive-by download sites). Fake accounts typically exhibit highly anomalous behavior, and hence, are relatively easy to detect. As a response, attackers have started to compromise and abuse legitimate accounts. Compromising legitimate accounts is very effective, as attackers can leverage the trust relationships that the account owners have established in the past. Moreover, compromised accounts are more difficult to clean up because a social network provider cannot simply delete the corresponding profiles. In this paper, we present a novel approach to detect compromised user accounts in social networks, and we apply it to two popular social networking sites, Twitter and Facebook. Our approach uses a composition of statistical modeling and anomaly detection to identify accounts that experience a sudden change in behavior. Since behavior changes can also be due to benign reasons (e.g., a user could switch her preferred client application or post updates at an unusual time), it is necessary to derive a way to distinguish between malicious and legitimate changes. To this end, we look for groups of accounts that all experience similar changes within a short period of time, assuming that these changes are the result of a malicious campaign that is unfolding. We developed a tool, called COMPA, that implements our approach, and we ran it on a large-scale dataset of more than 1.4 billion publicly-available Twitter messages, as well as on a dataset of 106 million Facebook messages. COMPA was able to identify compromised accounts on both social networks with high precision. © NDSS 2013.All rights reserved.","","Cybersecurity; Large dataset; Malware; Social networking (online); User profile; Anomalous behavior; Cyber criminals; Drive-by downloads; Facebook; Malwares; Network provider; Social-networking; Spam messages; Statistic modeling; Trust relationship; Anomaly detection"

This work focusses not on the logical aspects but rather on the protocol design/searching problem. It is important to have present the epistemic formal notions of that logic to fully understand the epistemic functions developed here. Secure protocols found in this card game scenario may be a good starting point for developing some aspects towards unconditional information security. Hill-Climbing and Genetic Algorithms are studied as searching techniques aimed to find optimal announcements that can be part of a secure communication protocol.

Especially along with higher level of integration of aerospace products realization, smaller satellites are preferred by providing equivalent functions. Compared with the features of larger satellite platform, such as higher capacity, multipurpose application and longer life cycle, smaller ones characterize with universalization, standardization and shorter R&D (Research and Development) cycle. Micro-satellites, one type in small satellites category, have been utilized in various fields, such as data communication, data transmission, ground and space environment surveillance, navigation and positioning, and outer space scientific experiments etc. As the development of technology, there has been a steady flow of advanced micro-components invention and utilization, and this directly leads to the rapid growth of micro-satellites R&D. More space missions are able to be completed by micro-satellites and their constellations, instead of expensive large satellites. Therefore, micro-satellites have attracted more attention and have been used with increasing frequency nowadays. The advantages of micro-satellites are gradually visible for their fast technology renovation, flexible configuration and application, and low economy and technology risks. The SAST50 Micro-satellite platform is of General-Purpose platform that is designed and developed by SAST (Shanghai Academy of Space Technology). It has the features of flexible configuration, modularization and rapid-development. At the initiate design stage, the multipurpose application adaptation is considered, while modularizing product design method is adopted. The whole platform is generally divided into two different modules: subsystem module and product module. To achieve the performance variability by selecting the modules in different performance parameters, the platform is divided into different functional boards, and the interfaces of these boards are simplified. The boards are manufactured and tested at the same time, hence the AIT(Assembly, Integration, and Testing) cycle time is shorten. The Micro-satellite platform can meet the requirements of the application in Rapid Response Space, satellite networking or formation and new technology test. By the development of this micro-satellite platform, the increasing requirements are fulfilled, such as military application in tactics and battles, civil application in emergency disaster relief and information security, as well as outer space scientific exploration and technology experiments etc. The development of the SAST50 platform provided a signification reference for General-Purpose satellite platforms design.

In 2007, the Secretariat of Finance of Minas Gerais started the project of Electronic Invoice - NF-e, which involves replacing the conventional invoice, on paper, by a document issued and stored electronically that exists only digitally. The purpose of the Electronic Invoice is documenting the movement of goods occurring between the seller and the buyer, which is subject to State taxes. The legal validity of the Electronic Invoice is guaranteed by the issuer's digital signature and by the reception of the data by Secretariat of Finance of Minas Gerais before of the movement of the goods. The information technology architecture of the Electronic Invoice authorization process of the Secretariat of Finance of the State of Minas Gerais is intended to ensure three basic objectives: 1) availability; 2) scalability and 3) elimination of single point of failure. So, the Secretariat of Finance of the State Minas Gerais concluded that the ISO 27001 certification of the information technology production environment, undergoing evaluation by external entities, namely, certification bodies, would demonstrate explicitly the commitment of the State of Minas Gerais with the general public and entrepreneurs who are based in the Minas Gerais and with those who intend establish themselves in the State of Minas Gerais in near future.

In order to test whether different factors explain/predict the information security behavior of those employees who do know the ISP and of those who do not know the ISP, we designed a study using the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) as the baseline theory. Employees' ISP knowledge was tested by asking a few questions related to their organization's ISP.

During the last years, two very promising developments around the wireless part of the smart grid communication were initialized, which possibly could have an impact on the network architectures and the markets far beyond Germany and far beyond energy automation. Besides the specification of the OMS Group of a security extension to the Wireless M-Bus protocol (EN13757-4), the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, BSI) has designed a Protection Profile (PP) and a Technical Directive (TR) for the communication unit of an intelligent measurement system (Smart Meter Gateway), which were released in March 2013. This design uses state of the art technologies and prescribes their implementation in real-life systems. At first, the proposed paper will present the most important characteristics of this architecture. It will then give an insight into the implementation of the OMS security protocols, which imply the usage of a mutually authenticated SSL protocol also in the Local Metrological Network. This is achieved with the help of an additional Authentication and Fragmentation Layer (AFL). This secure communication will be terminated in a BSI conformant secure smart meter gateway, which is developed in a different project and described in the second step.

Large organizations such as Sony or Lockheed Martin were recently attacked and lost confidential customer information. Besides targeted attacks, virus and malware infections, lost or stolen laptops and mobile devices, or the abuse of the organizational IT through employees, to name but a few, also put the security of assets in jeopardy. To defend against IS threats, organizations invest in IS countermeasures preventing, or, at least, reducing the probability and the impact of IS breaches. As IS budgets are constrained and the number of assets to be protected is large, IS investments need to be deliberately evaluated. Several approaches for the evaluation of IS investments are presented in the literature. In this chapter, we identify, compare, and evaluate such approaches using the example of a policy and security configuration management tool. Such a tool is expected to reduce the costs of organizational policy and security configuration management and to increase the trustworthiness of organizations.

Organisations generally apply a single-layer level of defence against information security threats, which includes phishing. This single-layer level of defence is certainly not adequate against modern-day phishing attacks. It is essential for organisations to implement a holistic approach, while considering human factors, organisational aspects and technological controls to combat phishing threats. However, in each of these three elements, weaknesses arise as each is linked by means of human involvement. As a result, this approach creates a gap for successful phishing attacks to potentially compromise these elements. This paper suggests possible linkages to cover the 'gaps' between each of these elements. More understanding is necessary on how these linkages can be managed more appropriately. As such, this paper introduces possible theories and best practices which can be used to understand and address each of these linkages and therefore attempts to bridge the phishing gap by strengthening the human element.","Agency theory; Human factors; Information security; Phishing; Social engineering; Technology acceptance model.

We propose a novel method to do risk assessments: MISRAM, the Model-based Information Security Risk Assessment Method. It uses an information architecture model, a method to assign values to information assets and IT components, and a method to calculate risks. The output of MISRAM is a ranked list of risks and a list of actionable tasks to solve the main issues. METHODS: MISRAM was applied as a test case to an e-Science research group at a Dutch research hospital. Meetings and surveys were used to create and evaluate lists of information assets and IT components. One meeting was used to create a list of practical task recommendations. RESULTS: Good insight into the information architecture and security problems of the IT infrastructure was gained. Also the participating group members confirmed that the identified security issues were realistic. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach raises awareness about security among the developers and operators of e-Science environments. It also gives insight in how the technical architecture affects information security. Traditional questionnaires are an important part of any risk assessment, and MISRAM's inclusion of such generic questionnaires is an important aspect to create an integrated information security risk assessment.","DCRA; E-Science; Information security; IT&T; MISRAM; Risk assessment; Science gateway","Architecture; Information management; Information retrieval; Information science; Risk assessment; Surveys; DCRA; E-sciences; Information architectures; Information security risk assessment; Integrated informations; MISRAM; Science gateway; Virtual research environment; Security of data"

We are focusing on these methods with a perspective that highlights the limits of both empiricism and the theoretical elements that underlie them. From an epistemological point of view we have considered the logical syntax of the two models, the semantics included in statements and the pragmatics of the scientific discourse: the use of models to demonstrate the risk assessment thesis, to solve the problems of risks in the human judgment versus mathematical calculus controversy. The major issues that we are discussing in this article imply various perspectives on scientific criteria, the choice among various theories and the structuring of problems proposed to be solved. We argue that the models that have been developed so far, the top-down approach (which involves well defined and well understood rules), as well as the demonstrations based on the induction method, cannot be applied in a lot of scenarios, because information systems, considered as a complex whole made up of various components, is primarily not a positivistic science solely described by mathematics. The main research question to be answered in this paper is: What are the limits of knowledge in probabilistic computations for information systems security risk assessment? Our purpose is to demonstrate the epistemological limits of the two models and the error of generalizing probability calculus using the interpretive approach.","Cause; Empiricism; Epistemology; Probabilities; Quantitative risk assessment; Space; Time","Calculations; Information management; Information systems; Probability; Security of data; Semantics; Cause; Empiricism; Epistemology; Quantitative risk assessment; Space; Time; Risk assessment"

The empirical tests of a structural model revealed that all proposed hypotheses are accepted, except the hypotheses proposing a positive link between business-based information security and the establishment of security knowledge sharing. Organisational structure has a major direct influence on the establishment of security knowledge sharing in organisations, while the effect of coordinating information security process is moderate. A mediation analysis revealed that the reason for the nonsignificant direct relation between business-based information security and security knowledge sharing is the fully mediating effect of coordinating information security process. Thus, coordinating information security process has an important role on security knowledge sharing by either partially or fully mediating the effects of both organisational structure and business-based information security on security knowledge sharing.

Some examples of this emphasis include security tools such as anti-virus software and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This reactive approach to security is effective against novice adversaries (i.e. script kiddies) because they typically use off-the-shelf tools and popular techniques to conduct their attacks. In contrast, the innovative adversaries often devise novel attack vectors and methodologies that can render reactive measures inadequate. These pioneering adversaries have continually pushed the security frontier forward and motivate a need for proactive security approaches. A proactive approach that we pursue in this research is actionable cyber-attack forecasting. The objectives of actionable cyber-attack forecasting are to learn an attacker's behavioral model, to predict future attacks, and to select appropriate countermeasures. The computational complexity of analyzing attacker models has been an impediment to the realization of reliable cyber-attack forecasting. We address this complexity issue by developing adversary models and corresponding complexity reduction techniques. We then introduce a heuristic for learning behavioral models of potentially deceptive adversaries online. Last, we consider a capture-the-flag problem, formulate the problem as a cybersecurity game with asymmetric information, and demonstrate how the models and techniques developed in this paper can be used to forecast a cyber-attack and recommend appropriate countermeasures. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.","asymmetric information games; belief compression; cyber-attack forecasting; game theory","Behavioral research; Computer crime; Embedded systems; Forecasting; Game theory; Antivirus softwares; Asymmetric information; Complexity reduction; Cyber-attacks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Pro-active approach; Security community; Tools and techniques; Security of data"

In fact, intellectual properties are becoming harder to protect and so are original contents, that's why we need techniques to be developed such as Image Steganography. Steganography is a technique for information hiding. It aims to embed secret data in to digital cover media, such as Images, Audio and Video without being suspicious. Evolutionary algorithms are stochastic search methods that mimic the natural bio logical evolution and the social behaviour of species. Such algorithms have been developed to arrive at near optimum solutions to large-scale optimization problems. For which traditional mathematical techniques may fail. In this paper, a novel stenographic method, based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is proposed, PSO is an evolutionary computational model based on Swarm intelligence. Kennedy and Elbe hart developed PSO through simulating social behaviour. In PSO, each individual is called a ""particle"" and the position of each particle is a candidate solution to a problem. LSB Matching Revisited (LSBMR) image steganography using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is proposed, in Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is used to select the embedding regions according to the size of the secret message and to optimize the threshold value of the selected image regions. In order to improve the quality of stego images, an optimal substitution matrix for transforming the secret messages is first derived by means of the PSO algorithm. The experimental results show that our proposed method has larger message capacity and better image quality then the existing method.","Information hiding; LSBMR; Message concealment; MSE; PSO; Region selection; Steganography","Artificial intelligence; Digital image storage; Image matching; Steganography; Stochastic systems; Information hiding; LSBMR; Message concealment; MSE; PSO; Region selections; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)"

This paper presents the results of an initial case study identifying real-world information security documentation issues for a Global Fortune 500 organization, should the organization decide to implement cloud computing services in the future. The paper demonstrates the importance of auditing policies, standards and guidelines applicable to cloud computing environments along with highlighting potential corporate concerns. The results from this case study has revealed that from the 1123 'relevant' statements found in the organization's security documentation, 175 statements were considered to be 'inadequate' for cloud computing. Furthermore, the paper provides a foundation for future analysis and research regarding implementation concerns for corporate cloud computing applications and services.","Cloud computing; Corporate policy; Guidelines; Information security; Requirements; Standard","Information systems; Security of data; Software reliability; Standards; Cloud computing environments; Cloud computing services; Corporate policies; Guidelines; Requirements; Security and privacy issues; Security documentation; Standards and guidelines; Cloud computing"

The process of memory acquisition presents unique evidentiary challenges since many acquisition techniques require code to be run on a potential compromised system, presenting an avenue for anti-forensic subversion. In this paper, we examine a number of simple anti-forensic techniques and test a representative sample of current commercial and free memory acquisition tools. We find that current tools are not resilient to very simple anti-forensic measures. We present a novel memory acquisition technique, based on direct page table manipulation and PCI hardware introspection, without relying on operating system facilities - making it more difficult to subvert. We then evaluate this technique’s further vulnerability to subversion by considering more advanced anti-forensic attacks. © 2013 Johannes Stüttgen and Michael Cohen. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Dealing with cyber-security at the international, national and enterprise level needs approaches that works across many disciplines and are holistic. Cybernetics is one such promising approach that will aid cyber-security at all levels due to its multidisciplinary nature. But there have been no significant efforts or studies to use cybernetics for cyber-security. In this paper, we propose a generic cybernetics paradigms framework for cyberspace that will be useful to study various mechanisms of cyberspace from economics, engineering, software and social perspectives.

Escalation presents a situation when employees must decide whether to persist or withdraw from nonperforming tasks at work. Drawing on self-justification theory and prospect theory, our model presents two escalation factors in explaining employee’s willingness to engage in noncompliance behaviour with ISPs: self-justification and risk perceptions. We also propose that perceived benefits of noncompliance and perceived costs of compliance, at the intersection of cognitive and emotional driven acts influence self-justification. The model is tested based on 376 respondents from banking industry. The results show that while self-justification has a significant impact on willingness, risk perceptions do not moderate their relation. We suggest that future research should explore the roles of self-justification in noncompliance to a greater extent. © Miranda Kajtazi, Hasan Cavusoglu, Izak Benbasat and Darek Haftor 2013.","Escalation of commitment behaviour; Information security policy; Noncompliance behaviour; Risk perceptions; Self-justification","Behavioral research; Mobile security; Risk perception; Security systems; Banking industry; Escalation of commitments; Information security policies; Noncompliance behaviour; Perceived benefits; Perceived costs; Prospect theory; Self-justification; Security of data"

The paper investigates the effectiveness of sandbox environment in widely used tool named as Sandboxie, and outline how to perform investigation when this tool is used to perform a criminal or illegal act. For the purpose of experimental investigation we have considered two test cases and several scenarios. In the first case we assumed that user simply used sandboxie and terminated it, while in second case we assumed the user also deleted the sandboxie contents after using it. In this investigation process, first common places where evidences are usually found in general scenarios are examined, and then other locations in local machine are examined using special forensics tools. Also the main/physical memory (RAM) is captured and examined for traces. Through these experiments we showed that no trails could be found in common places for any activity if a user deletes his sandboxie content. However, the complete isolation does not occur and some traces can be found into the main memory (RAM) as well as in unallocated clusterson the disks.

In a Federated environment, CSP have an unlimited amount of resources due to the fact that each CSP can use the resources of other CSPs to serve its own clients when its own resources cannot do it. In a same concept, CSPs will be able to sell their unused capacity for other CSPs. From this definition, CSPs could buy resources in the federation in order to serve the upcoming requests that go beyond one CSP capacity. Also, by selling resources, CSPs will increase their revenues. A pre-agreement must be done between CSPs willing to participate to the federation in order to define the rules that manage such environment.

It emphasizes a holistic view of IP: one that protects the applications, systems, and networks that deliver business information from failures of confidentiality, integrity, availability, trust and accountability, and privacy. Using the guidelines provided in the Information Protection Playbook, security and information technology (IT) managers will learn how to implement the five functions of an IP framework: governance, program planning, risk management, incident response management, and program administration. These functions are based on a model promoted by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and validated by thousands of Certified Information Security Managers. The five functions are further broken down into a series of objectives or milestones to be achieved in order to implement an IP framework. The extensive appendices included at the end of the book make for an excellent resource for the security or IT manager building an IP program from the ground up. They include, for example, a board of directors presentation complete with sample slides; an IP policy document checklist; a risk prioritization procedure matrix, which illustrates how to classify a threat based on a scale of high, medium, and low; a facility management self-assessment questionnaire; and a list of representative job descriptions for roles in IP.

Data hiding in images has flourished in recent years as an important field for information security. An Intermediate Significant Bit (ISB) plane based data hiding technique is investigated and presented in this paper. The data to be embedded in a cover image has been scrambled, and embedding has been carried out at the address locations pointed to by Pseudorandom Address Vector (PAV). The perceptual degradation of the image caused due to embedding in ISB planes has been taken care of by using Post Embedding Pixel Adjustment (PEA) technique. The pseudorandom embedding of encrypted data provides a two tier of security to the embedded secret data. The comparison of the proposed technique with an existing data hiding scheme shows that proposed technique is capable of providing better quality stego-images even if the payload is slightly more. This is validated by an improvement in PSNR by about 3dB. Further, an important advantage offered by this technique is that the embedded data is not vulnerable to LSB removal/replacement attack as data is embedded in ISB planes. © 2013 IEEE.","Cryptography; Pixel Adjustment; Scrambling; Steganography","Communication systems; Cryptography; Multimedia signal processing; Pixels; Data hiding; Encrypted data; Pseudo random; Scrambling; Secret data; Significant bit planes; Spatial domains; Stego image; Steganography"

An Information Technology Strategic Plan (ITSP) aims at discovering the resources and IT in an organization, to direct the technological and information architecture to its strategic objectives. The Brazilian Government issued a Normative Instruction (NI04) for public organizations to develop IT Strategic Plans so that they can purchase products and services.

The concern and interest in information security is mainly due to the fact that information security risk assessment (ISRA) is a vital method to not only to identify and prioritize information assets but also to identify and monitor the specific threats that an organization induces; especially the chances of these threats occurring and their impact on the respective businesses. However, organizations wanting toconduct risk assessment may face problemsinselecting suitablemethodsthatwouldaugurwellinmeeting theirneeds. This is due to the existence of numerous methodologies that are readily available. However, there is a lack in agreed reference benchmarking as well as in the comparative framework for evaluating these ISRA methods to access the information security risk. Generally, organizations will choose the most appropriate ISRA method by carrying out a comparative study between the available methodologies in detail before a suitable method is selected to conduct the risk assessment. This paper suggests a conceptual framework of info-structure for ISRA that was developed by comparing and analysing six methodologies which are currently available. The infostructure for ISRA aims to assist organizations in getting a general view of ISRA flow, gathering information on the requirements to be met before risk assessment can be conducted successfully. This info-structure can be conveniently used by organizations to complete all the required planning as well as the selection of suitable methods to complete the ISRA. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It was interesting to find that information privacy-security was perceived differently by the participants in online buying to those involved in online selling. Examination of different demographic traits also shed light on the relationship between these traits and information privacy-security; for instance, females are found to be more concerned about information privacy-security; more international students regarded information privacy as an impediment in their potential use of the Web for selling. In addition, the role of culture in moderating the relationship between information privacy-security and the intention to buy and sell online was also examined.

This study attempts to describe and analyze the current role of the government of Jordan in facilitating the security of e-business.

This can be achieved by understanding the real security needs and concerns of the various stakeholders at the different e-business stages and then aligning them to its policy and plans.

However, most of these mechanisms do not proactively protect sensitive data; rather, they work under predefined policies and conditions to protect data in general. Few systems such as anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) might work independently without much administrative interference, but with no dedication to sensitivity of data. New mechanisms called data leakage prevention systems (DLP) have been developed to mitigate the risk of sensitive data leakage. Current DLPs mostly use data fingerprinting and exact and partial document matching to classify sensitive data. These approaches can have a serious limitation because they are susceptible to data misidentification. In this paper, we investigate the use of N-grams statistical analysis for data classification purposes. Our method is based on using N-grams frequency to classify documents under distinct categories. We are using simple taxicap geometry to compute the similarity between documents and existing categories. Moreover, we examine the effect of removing the most common words and connecting phrases on the overall classification. We are aiming to compensate the limitations in current data classification approaches used in the field of data leakage prevention. We show that our method is capable of correctly classifying up to 90.5% of the tested documents. © 2013 IEEE.","Data leakage prevention; N-gram profiles; N-grams","Communication systems; Computational geometry; Security of data; Signal processing; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Classification models; Data classification; Data confidentiality; Data leakage preventions; Document matching; N-gram profiles; N-grams; Classification (of information)"

The general assessment of the information security status of a company gives the students a view into what the companies have taken into practice and if they have used theoretical models to guide their work. The analysis of the status and suggestions for improvements also teach the students to scale the theory with the size and operations of the company. This is important because usually information security management literature takes the viewpoint of large organizations, whereas the companies that participate in the assessment are small or medium-sized. Course feedback from the students shows that the assignment is perceived to be useful and interesting, and that it works well when paired with the theoretical teaching of the course. The students find working with real companies motivating, and state that they have learned more than they would have learned on a purely theoretical course. The paper discusses experiences from the course to present a teaching and learning method worth experimenting with in other universities.","Experiential learning & education; Information assurance and security; Motivation; Student perceptions","Education computing; Industrial management; Industry; Motivation; Security of data; Students; Experiential learning; Information assurance and securities; Information security managements; Large organizations; Small and medium enterprise; Student perceptions; Teaching and learning methods; Teaching methods; Teaching"

According to the best knowledge of the authors, up to now, there are no research with this perspective on cloud security in the literature. This chapter represents our first discussion of this infrastructure security in the context of SPI service delivery models (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS). Non-information security professionals are cautioned not to simply equate infrastructure security to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) security. Although infrastructure security is more highly relevant to customers of IaaS, similar consideration should be given to providers' platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) environments, since they have ramifications to customer threat, risk, and compliance management. Another dimension is the cloud business model (public, private, and hybrid clouds), which is orthogonal to the SPI service delivery model; what we highlight is the relevance of discussion points as they apply to public and private clouds. When discussing public clouds, the scope of infrastructure security is limited to the layers of infrastructure that move beyond the organization's control and into the hands of service providers (i.e., when responsibility to a secure infrastructure is transferred to the cloud service provider [CSP], based on the SPI delivery model). Information in this chapter is critical for customers in gaining an understanding of what security a CSP provides and what security the customer is responsible for providing. This chapter discusses conceptual issues, basic requirements, and practical suggestions for designing dynamically configured security infrastructure provisioned on demand as part of the cloud-based infrastructure. We end this chapter by describing general-use cases for provisioning cloud infrastructure that provide bases for defining security infrastructure requirements. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Recently with the advancement in technology and the rapid exponential growth in the means of communication there are various domains emerged in the field of communication. Data hiding is a recently developed technique in the field of information security and has received significant attention from both academia and industry. Steganography is the practice of encoding secret information in a manner such that the very existence of the information is concealed. Steganography means hiding data inside cover objects such as images that will escape detection and can be retrieved with no distortion at the receiver. The messages such as images, videos, audio files, text and other computer files can be hidden inside images or other digital objects. The purpose of Steganography is not to keep others from knowing the hidden information - it is to keep others away from thinking that the information even exists. This paper presents one of the latest advancements accomplished in the field of data security. In this project a secret text message, technically known as the payload is embedded into a video which is called the cover video. For a general view it seems as a simple video file that is transmitted finally but actually it has got the secret text message hidden in it.","Data hiding; Text steganography; Video Steganography; Video steganography","Engineering; Data hiding; Digital Objects; Exponential growth; Hidden information; Information exchanges; Secret information; Text steganography; Video steganography; Steganography"

This chapter investigates information security awareness in terms of knowledge, attitude, and behavior. Research was carried out using a survey method. To evaluate the information security awareness of staff, we developed nine components. Seven independent variables-gender, education level, IT awareness, working experience, occupation, field, and job category-were also selected for developing the conceptual model.

In 2013, people will purchase 1.2 billion mobile devices, surpassing personal computers as the most common method for accessing the Internet. However, security of these mobile devices is a major concern for organizations. The two leading mobile operating systems (OS), Google's Android OS and Apple's iOS, both have security concerns as do the mobile applications and the major application markets. 'Bring your own devices,' where employees supply their own equipment for work-related purposes, can cut costs for organizations, but failing to address security can significantly increase those costs. This paper focuses on the increasing need for mobile business and its related mobile device security concerns. We propose that future IT professionals should be aware of these issues and learn how to secure mobile devices through the integration of the topic into the IT Model Curriculum. Using the case of one undergraduate IT program, we developed a set of mobile device security education recommendations, which we then mapped to the IT Model Curriculum using the guidelines from Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).

Information in such environments is managed by systems formed mostly of devices with limited capabilities. Indeed, AmI characteristics, difficult to handle by traditional computing concepts, are making the agent paradigm to gain impetus and increasing the interest of researchers and industry in this concept. However, the inherent complexity of information security is bigger in agent-based AmI systems built by gathering distributed information and services that are not under the control of a single entity, and introduce new security and privacy concerns. In fact, securing these systems requires protecting any element from every other. This paper proposes a mechanism for enhancing security and privacy while using agents in AmI environments, based on three main building blocks: verification, judgment and surveillance. Furthermore, the key idea is based on cooperation and collective decision.

For any e-health information system, the need for increased trust by such clients with potentially little knowledge of any security scheme involved is paramount. In addition notable scalability of any system has become a critical aspect of system design, development and ongoing management. Meanwhile cryptographic systems provide the security provisions needed for confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation. Cryptographic key management, however, must be secure, yet efficient and effective in developing an attitude of trust in system users. Digital certificate-based Public Key Infrastructure has long been the technology of choice or availability for information security/assurance; however, there appears to be a notable lack of successful implementations and deployments globally. Moreover, recent issues with associated Certificate Authority security have damaged trust in these schemes. This paper proposes the adoption of a centralised public key registry structure, a non-certificate based scheme, for large scale e-health information systems. The proposed structure removes complex certificate management, revocation and a complex certificate validation structure while maintaining overall system security. Moreover, the registry concept may be easier for both healthcare professionals and patients to understand and trust. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.

FUZZBUSTER uses different types of test cases to measure security and functionality. In this paper, we describe FUZZBUSTER's adaptation metrics and we present two different policies for balancing security and functionality.

Using analysis from Sorrell V. IMS Health Inc., marketing theory, and the work of Pierre Bourdieu, it argues that the value in information contracts is inherently relational: consumers provide ""things of value"" - rights of access to valuable informational constructs of identity and context - in exchange for access to certain services provided by the data aggregator. This Article presents a contract-based consumer protection approach to privacy and information security. Modeled on trade secret law and landlord-tenant law, it advocates for courts and legislatures to adopt a ""reasonable data stewardship"" approach that relies on a set of implied promises - nonwaivable contract warranties and remedies - to maintain contextual integrity of information and improve consumer privacy.","",""

In addition, vulnerability assessment standardizes the three main steps of the assessment process: representing configuration information of systems for testing; analyzing the system for the presence of the specified machine state (vulnerability, configuration, patch state, etc.); and, reporting the results of the assessment. In this way, vulnerability assessment enables open and publicly available security content and standardizes the transfer of this content across the entire spectrum of information security tools and services.

Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) focus primarily on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, attempting to stop them, and reporting them to security administrators. In addition, organizations use IPSs for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats, and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IPSs have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. IPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events, and produce reports. Many IPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attack's content. This chapter describes the characteristics of IPS technologies and provides recommendations for designing, implementing, configuring, securing, monitoring, and maintaining them. The types of IPS technologies are differentiated primarily by the types of events that they monitor and the ways in which they are deployed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

With the help of cloud computing, users can access their data and obtain different services anywhere and anytime. However, many people and companies still hesitate to use cloud based services because of the information security problem. If the problem cannot be solved properly, the clouds may become a threat to the whole world. Although cryptography is an important technology for solving the problem, it also reveals the existence of secret information and may attract pin-point attacks. In this study, we propose a new type of steganography, in which secret is embedded as hidden information into a virtual but natural image synthesized through image morphing. The basic idea is to make the existence and the meaning of the information unaware, and to make it extremely difficult for unauthorized persons and groups to read or even to find the information. Initial analyses show that the proposed technology is secure, and can be a very promising technique for protecting secret information in cloud computing environments. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Cryptography; Image morphing; Image Synthesis; Information hiding; Stegonography; Un-awareness","Cloud computing; Computer systems; Cryptography; Steganography; Technology; Image morphing; Image synthesis; Information hiding; Stegonography; Un-awareness; Problem solving"

The key escrow is one of the hot topics of encryption technology in recent years. As for the general key escrow scheme, the private key is divided into n parts and the private key can be reconstructed if k (k = n) escrow agents hand over their hosting parts. At the same time, one or several escrow parties can be also given several (fewer than k) key parts so as to have greater weight. But this is only the simplest weight consideration. The flexible set of the escrow parties (escrow agent) hasn't been considered in these schemes. In this paper, an important problem that is widely overlooked has been addressed, namely an escrow party is the most trusted or the most important who has the denial right. And the joint stratagem of all other agents is not workable over monitoring users without its participation. In this paper, the design of the key escrow scheme in which an escrow agent must participate has been described. The most important escrow party can be the notary public, the reliable department designated by the government or the authorities recognized by the government and the civil society. It should be cooperated with other escrow parties and the number of co-escrow parties should reach to the threshold value. Then the private key can be recovered. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Advanced threshold scheme; Denial right; Escrow agent; Key escrow","Computer science; Information technology; Civil society; Denial right; Encryption technologies; Hot topics; Key escrow; Large-scale applications; Private key; Threshold schemes; Security of data"

Engineering managers are responsible for their company's process control systems safe, efficient, and effective operation. Process control cybersecurity is an expanding risk factor which engineering managers may need to provide a greater focus on than they have previously done. This paper explores process control cyber security from the engineering mangers view. The paper objective is to assist in enhancing engineering mangers understanding of the issues as well as provide a concept on how to develop a program that assists in mitigating these risks. To achieve the objective the paper discusses how process control cyber security has emerged as a 21 st century risk.

Students can benefit from the study of information systems security when security concepts are introduced in the context of real-world industry standards. The development of a data security standard for organizations operating within the credit card payment industry serves as an excellent example of a real-world security standard that lends itself to classroom study. The establishment and requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the associated consequences for noncompliance, represents a businesslike approach to the organizational protection of data that students will find interesting and one to which they will relate. Everybody uses credit cards! Incorporating the topic of PCI DSS into an activity allows students to learn and apply PCI DSS concepts to a business setting. Just asking ""If everyone uses credit cards, why don't all businesses accept them?"" will start a process of exploration for the class. A hypothetical business teaching case, Blue Mountain Jams (BMJ), illustrates the challenge of PCI DSS mandates for small businesses. Small business is given some leeway in self-assessment under PCI DSS to document compliance after the decision is made to accept credit card payments. That leeway gives students the opportunity to learn and analyze the PCI DSS requirements and compliance methods and to determine the best course of action for a business that has made the decision to start accepting credit cards.","Critical thinking; Information assurance and security; Security; Teaching case","Industry; Information systems; Students; Teaching; Credit card payment; Critical thinking; Data security standards; Information assurance and securities; Information systems security; Payment card industries; Security; Security standards; Security of data"

As security managers in the industry usually have to operate with limited budgets allocated to information security, they need to prioritize their investment efforts regarding the response mechanisms to the existing vulnerabilities. The utilization of quantitative security vulnerability assessment methods enables efficient prioritization of security efforts and investments to mitigate the discovered vulnerabilities and thus an opportunity to lower expected losses. State of the art approaches for vulnerability assessment such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which is the de facto standard quantifying the severity of vulnerabilities, do not consider the economic impact in case of a vulnerability exploit. To this end, our paper targets the quantitative understanding of vulnerability severity taking into account the potential economic damage a successful vulnerability exploit can cause. We propose a novel approach for a systematic consideration of the relevant cost units (associated costs) for the economic damage estimation of vulnerability exploits. Our approach utilizes Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods to perform a prioritization of the existing vulnerabilities within the target system. The evaluation results show the potential cost savings w.r.t. the mitigation costs using our approach.

The objective of this protocol is not only to encourage actors to provide good services consecutively to establish a security environment of network but also to punish strictly those malicious actors that are trying to take advantage of reputation system to launch malicious attacks.

As a result, a constant stream of compound-words describing new concepts and new technologies has arisen. However, the existing dictionary does not collect those new compound-words in time, so it cannot identify them correctly. In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a SVM-based compound-word recognition method in information security. The method is based on the outputs of the existing word segmentation system. It constructs adjacent atom-word digraph according to the statistical co-occurrence features and lexical rules. Next, it produces compound-word candidate set through deep traverse the digraph by the longest match principle. It further filters the candidate set by using a SVM classifier with the help of domain contrast corpus and computer dictionary. We use this method to identify new compound-words from 2200 vulnerability description texts. It achieves a precision of 82.25% and recall of 77.44%. The results show that our method is able to effectively identify new compound-words in information security from large scale of corpus. © 2013 IEEE.","compound-word; depth first traversal; domain contrast corpus; SVM","Computational linguistics; Directed graphs; Fuzzy systems; Vocabulary control; Co-occurrence features; Compound words; Depth first; domain contrast corpus; Longest match principles; SVM; Vulnerability description; Word segmentation systems; Security of data"

In this regard, an effectiveness score is defined for each countermeasure based on its mitigation level against all threats. Organizations are always looking for more effective low-cost solutions, so another consideration is that the implementation cost of the selected countermeasure portfolio should not exceed the allocated budget. Following the knapsack idea, the implementation cost of each countermeasure and its effectiveness, defined as inputs and the best subset, are chosen with respect to budget limits.

The document may appear normal in its format, but behave strangely or beyond users' expectation, sometimes lead to severe consequences when it is opened. Detecting malicious documents tops one of the most important tasks in modern information security. Malicious documents usually contain specific control codes inside which may cause the malicious shell code be executed automatically. The document control code is originally designed to enrich the documents' functionalities, but in this case, it may create vulnerabilities and then become a key to trigger attacks. Detecting control codes of certain pattern is a key to the success of malicious document detection. Different from previous research that was focused on detecting malicious documents of a particular format or containing specific control codes, we propose a method that analyzes the document objects from three general views: the use of functional words, preference words, and constant data. The functional words control how an attack is launched, and through what actions, if the document is considered a malicious one, the preference words usually suggest the favored word choices from document authors, and the constant data can be considered the bullets to complete the attack. We also propose a TF-IDF method to normalize the features to detect documents with mimicry attacks. Overall, given the three feature views, we detect malicious documents under a classification framework. We evaluate the proposed approach through series of experiments that use different view combinations for prediction, followed by some comparison of the proposed method to related work. © 2013 IEEE.","exploit; malicious document; multi-view; PDF; vulnerability","Artificial intelligence; Security of data; exploit; malicious document; Multi-views; PDF; vulnerability; Feature extraction"

Having the ability to gauge and measure exposure within an environment effectively prepares the organization to proactively implement workflows and assessments. Defining security holes in an organization is the delineation of risk that may exist. It is necessary to architect a framework to analyze exclusive incidents, potential outcomes that may arise from such incidents, and the impending consequences. Managing vulnerability where a team can identify, classify, remediate, and mitigate potential situations is critical to keeping a business up and running. Additionally, tools can be utilized to identify and classify possible vulnerabilities. Information security needs to be in line with the business objectives, and decisions must be made based on metrics and indicators of vulnerabilities. Regularly combining assessments and audits offers executives a clear, prioritized, and comprehensive view of risks and vulnerabilities, while integrating IT assets, resources, environment and processes into a single platform. Just as IP addresses had to advance from IPv4 to IPv6, password lengths will have to increase, as will their complexity.

However, cyber security attacks are just not limited to IT networks. With the advent of Stuxnet, cyber security attacks on control and SCADA systems have become a reality. The threat of cyber security attacks on our nation's critical control systems infrastructure, which includes our power generation facilities, presents yet another challenge to utility directors and staff. We will discuss what the federal government is doing about cyber security and the impact of the latest Presidential Executive Order. As part of the growing need for cyber security, the types of malwares and viruses that have been designed to attack SCADA systems (such as Stuxnet and Flame) will be examined. To address the need to secure our critical control systems, the paper will discuss the latest standards, regulations and guidelines that can be applied to the power industry. The discussion will focus on the NERC CIP Version 5 standards and the ISA99, Industrial Automation and Control Systems Security standards. Based on the ISA99 standards and Department of Homeland Security guidelines, there are a number of best practices that engineers can employ in designing control systems networks and end users can implement for existing systems. These include authentication and auditing, intrusion detection, and defense-in-depth strategies including firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs). We will focus on these best practices and how they are applicable to the Version 5 NERC-CIP standards.","Access controls; Authentication; Authorization; Cybersecurity; Encryption; Filtering; Firewalls; ISA-99; NERC-CIP; NIST 800-82; Stuxnet; Virtual private networks","Access control; Authentication; Computer system firewalls; Cryptography; Filtration; Intrusion detection; National security; SCADA systems; Security systems; Standards; Virtual private networks; Viruses; Authorization; Cyber security; ISA-99; NERC-CIP; NIST 800-82; Stuxnet; Computer viruses"

The WikiLeaks affair is simultaneously 1) emblematic of a new world order, 2) the product of state power encountering a technologically-enabled counter-power, and 3) a focal point for the (re)negotiation of norms and values governing the control of and access to information. This public controversy concerns the rights and responsibilities of citizens and the state vis-a-vis information, with profound implications for public life, diplomacy, and international relations. Not only is it substantively about the media, it is also in the media and argued through the media. Drawing from a variety of disciplines such as communication studies, rhetoric, sociology, political science, and international relations, this paper examines public discourse in the forms of official rhetoric (coming from the U.S. government, WikiLeaks and proxies for either party), as well as the comments of media and scholarly observers, as representative of arguments that work to define and constitute these ideas as discursively sustained institutions of civic and political culture. This qualitative study relies chiefly on archival research focused on news articles published by the global newspapers that collaborated with WikiLeaks on the so-called Cablegate releases, feature-length articles from prominent newsmagazines, and other publications. ©Common Ground, Nathalie Marechal.","Bradley manning; Chelsea manning; Cybersecurity; Hacker ethic; Hacking; Information security; Julian assange; Leaks; Privacy; Surveillance; Transparency; Whistle-blowers; WikiLeaks",""

Even so, the complexity of the system is leading to an increase in the response time due to various bottlenecks in relation to information flow. As a result, a paradigm shift in security auditing in cyberspace is required. An approach based on intelligent agents may decrease the time needed to gather and process the basic information. A multi-agent system with the goal of helping the user, the security expert, and the security officer is presented in this chapter. The system will process local knowledge databases as well as external information provided by social networks, news feeds, and other forms of published information available on the Internet.

With the term of 'lossless', secret information is embedded into original image with methods developed by researchers at the encoder, and marked image is produced. Correspondingly, at the decoder, users are capable of perfectly separating the embedded secret and original image from the marked image, based on the reasonable amount of side information, and it is the major reason for the name of 'lossless'. In this paper, we propose an optimized method based on hybrid prediction for lossless data hiding. With the characteristics of the original image, the predicted image can be produced firstly. Then, difference values between the two are utilized for the embedding of secret information. And finally, the marked image can be obtained by adding back the modified difference values. With the properly designed fitness function to control the error between original image and marked one, enhanced amount of secret information can be embedded. Besides, the amount of side information is reasonable for decoding. With the optimization of genetic algorithm, simulation results have revealed that with the same quality of marked images, increased amount of secret information can be observed with our algorithm. It also provides the flexibility in the design of fitness function to meet the needs for practical implementations. © 2013 IEEE.","Capacity; Hybrid prediction; Lossless data hiding; Output image quality","Computer vision; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Signal processing; Capacity; Difference values; Fitness functions; Hybrid predictions; Lossless data hiding; Original images; Secret information; Side information; Steganography"

As for the network that used as a medium for data delivery, can be via fibre-optic cable, GPRS modem, VSAT satellite, RF channels, and so on. Problems can occur when the data is sent as a plaintext (not secure). Such data can be read by unauthorized persons in various ways.

This paper explores structures of ISO 27001 and KATAKRI and presents results of gap analysis of risk management requirements between ISO 27001 controls for information security management and KATAKRI requirements.","Information security management system (ISMS); ISO 27001; KATAKRI; Risk management","Industrial management; Information management; ISO Standards; National security; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Security of data; Security systems; Gap analysis; Information security management system; Information security managements; ISO 27001; KATAKRI; Management IS; Private sectors; Risks management; Security management systems; Specific information; Risk management"

A major shift away from hobby hacking towards well-organized cyber crimes can be observed. The aim of these criminal organizations is the commercial exploitation of vulnerabilities in ICT infrastructures. Since attacks become more and more coordinated, we argue that counter measures must be properly coordinated too. Additionally, networks have grown to a scale and complexity, and have reached a degree of interconnectedness, that their protection can often only be guaranteed and financed as shared efforts. In this paper, we therefore introduce the concept of social cyber defense alliances. These alliances are shaped by social networks which connect information security stakeholders from various domains and facilitate the sharing of incident information. Some primary challenges include: 1) how to encourage participating stakeholders to contribute, and 2) how to ensure the quality and reliability of shared incident information. Here, we discuss an incentive model, which encourages information security stakeholders to share incident information. Furthermore, we highlight an architectural blueprint which is able to support the establishment of our proposed social cyber defense alliances in a real world context, and evaluate its applicability using agent-based simulations. © 2013 IEEE.","cyber alliances; incentive model; information exchange format; security incident sharing architecture","Information dissemination; Personal computing; Agent based simulation; Commercial exploitation; cyber alliances; ICT infrastructures; Incentive models; Information exchanges; Information sharing; Sharing architectures; Network security"

In previous CA-based multiple-SIS schemes, the resulting encrypted files are noise-like appearance images, which arises suspicion of observers when these are transmitted through a public network. To solve this problem, the LSB steganography is used to hide the encrypted noise-like images into camouflage images. To reduce execution time of the encoding and the decoding process of the SIS scheme, a parallel implementation based on CUDA technology is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed parallel algorithm is more than 7 times faster than the conventional sequential algorithm.

Security in Cloud Computing is a challenging research problem because it involves many interdependent tasks including vulnerability scanning, application layer firewalls, configuration management, alert monitoring and analysis, source code analysis, and user identity management. It is widely accepted that we cannot build software and computing systems that are free from vulnerabilities and cannot be penetrated or attacked. Consequently, there is a strong interest in resilience approach because of its potential to address the cybersecurity challenges. Our is based on using the Dynamic Data Driven Application System (DDDAS) and Moving Target Defence (MTD) strategies to develop resilient DDDAS. The Resilient Applications utilize the following capabilities: Software Behaviour Encryption (SBE), Replication, Diversity, Automated Checkpointing and Recovery. Software Behaviour Encryption employs spatiotemporal behaviour encryption and a moving target defence to make active software components change their implementations and their resources randomly and consequently evade attackers. Diversity and random execution is achieved by ""hot"" shuffling multiple functionally- equivalent, behaviourally-different software versions at runtime (This encryption of the execution environment will make it extremely difficult for an attack to disrupt the normal operations of a cloud application. Also, the dynamic change in the execution environment will hide the software flaws that would otherwise be exploited by a cyberattacker. Checkpointing is used to save the current state of the task to a reliable storage and thus enabling rollback recovery if it is required to tolerate cyberattacks and mitigate their impacts. We use the Compiler for Portable Checkpointing (CPPC), a tool for automatically inserting portable checkpoints into the code. We also evaluate the performance and overhead of running three applications in our rDDDAS environment. Our experimental results show that the rDDDAS environment can be used to develop resilient cloud applications are resilient against attacks with around 7% in execution time overhead. © 2013 The Authors.

The distributed nature of the Internet combined with various anonymizing technologies contributes to making the attribution problem more difficult, especially when traversing hostile networks. What is needed is a new way to assist in attribution performance; this method must be technology independent. Culture offers a technology independent vector for analysing CNAs. The human mind uses both conscious and unconscious thought, and both of these processes are culturally influenced. This researcher seeks to determine if those cultural influences leave traces in CNA choices and behaviours. Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions provide a framework for evaluating and understanding various behaviours. Hofstede's framework has been used in academia and business for research in order to better understand other cultures. Hofstede avails his data for researchers in all disciplines. The goal of this study is to determine if Hofstede's framework can be applied to the cyber environment in order to understand CNAs with the hope of greater understanding of cyber adversary choices and behaviours. The preliminary findings support the hypothesis: culture influences CNA choices and behaviours. Two sets of data were examined across all six cultural dimensions. The analysed data displayed statistically significant findings across three dimensions: power distance, individualism versus collectivism, and indulgence versus restraint. The tests performed were quantitative and included means comparison tests for the first data set, and group comparison tests in the second data set. The findings revealed valuable data in both the easily seen visible results, and in the areas that lacked data. These findings suggest that culture not only influences CNA choices and behaviours, but may also influence non-behaviours. The results of this research study suggest the need for additional research targeted toward specific cultural dimensions.","Automatic thought; Computer network attack (CNA) choices and behaviours; Cultural dimensions; Hofstede","Computer crime; Computer networks; Network security; Attack attribution; Automatic thought; Comparison test; Computer network attack  choice and behavior; Computer network attacks; Cultural dimensions; Data set; Hofstede; Information security professionals; Technology independent; Statistical tests"

Our mechanism is based on Microsoft .NET technologies. Unlike rival competitors, it is not intrusive, as it hardly modifies the source code of any component of the system to be monitored. Our mechanism consists of four modules: the specification module, which comes with a security policy specification language, geared towards the capture of integrity policies; the monitoring module, which includes a code injector, whereby the mechanism observes how specific methods of the system, referred to by some policy, are invoked; the verifier module, which examines the operation of the distributed system in order to determine whether is policy compliant or not; and, the reporter module, which notifies the system is policy compliant, or sends an alert upon the occurrence of a contingency, indicating policy violation. We argue that our mechanism can be framed within the Clark and Wilson security model, and, thus, used to realise information integrity.

Regardless of the type of security-based framework, or the levels of effort and investments made in technology, enterprises remain vulnerable to attacks that consequently have negative business, social and political repercussions. An enterprise's lack of an effective defensive posture and resilient countermeasures are best understood in the context of dynamic complex systems behavior and systems thinking approach to enterprises and security. This research paper examines key issues that undermine the ability of an enterprise to develop a viable and effective security posture. Recognition of such concerns then provides input and direction into the development of an alternative approach to information security for enterprises expressed in the development of Enterprise Ontology and security based Business Capability Framework that is derived from the strategic goals and objectives of the organization. The proposed solution considers the creation of an enterprise-specific ontology that expresses the enterprise as a complex system. A security framework is developed that recognizes the enterprise as a set of business capabilities that have measureable strategic outcomes against which business decisions regarding security are made. To ensure a balanced implementation of security, a business value model is defined that is a function of financial, operational and quality assurance measures. The concept of value chain is used to represent the relationship between strategy and enterprise domain resources of which security is an integral component and driver rather than a post or ad hoc consideration. Validation of the Enterprise Ontology and Information Security Capability-Driven Framework is derived from the creation of a business strategy to business capability value map and the quantification of key business and security metrics. A set of ontology-based competency questions allows the business to make informed and judicial decisions regarding how and where security should be applied. Successful analysis of the results of this study demonstrates the usefulness of the model in guiding the organization to assess current security risks and make informed, business-motivated security decisions and deployment strategies that are balanced in accordance with the scarce resource of the enterprise whilst maintaining alignment to the strategic imperatives of the organization. Further opportunities exist to improve the creation and quality of Enterprise Ontology through reuse and auto discovery techniques. The ability to respond in a timely manner driven from selective causal feedback loops to changes in the business model whilst evaluating impact against the enterprise's current set of business and technical capabilities and business strategy becomes a critical success factor in the development of an effective security model for the enterprise. The development of a more rigorous and systematic approach to modeling the enterprise's current state and assessment of future state scenarios using the business capability framework creates consistent and repeatable process within the organization. Semantically driven conceptual models of the enterprise may also be expressed in key security technologies and systems that support the organization by forming a collection of ontology-aware integrated technologies that respond and react collectively to attacks.","Business capability; Complex systems; Enterprise strategic planning; IT security; Ontology; Reliability","Information management; Large scale systems; Quality assurance; Reliability; Risk assessment; Security of data; Strategic planning; Critical success factor; Dynamic complex system; Enterprise ontology; Integrated technologies; IT security; Security frameworks; Strategic imperative; Technical capabilities; Ontology"

In 2002 a committee of UK Members of Parliament highlighted how unprepared the country was to deal with this problem: ""We have around 140,000 police officers in the UK. Barely 1000 have been trained to handle digital evidence at the basic level and fewer than 250 of them are currently with Computer Crime Units or have higher-level forensic skills."" Since then the capacity to deal with digital crime has improved but the problem has grown alarmingly. In the last decade the author has been working with The College of Policing (formerly named the NPIA) and developed a jointly validated Masters programme for UK law enforcement, intelligence and Government agencies. A variety of courses have now been taken by thousands of police officers in this area acting as first-responders to crime scenes and more specialist High Tech Crime Units. The European Commission has committed significant research and development funding in seeking to protect the community from Cybercrime and Cyberwar. This paper discusses a new European Commission funded project ECENTRE - England's Cybercrime Centre of Excellence Network for Training, Research and Education. On 20th December 2012 the European Commission signed the €0.935million (£760,000) contract for the project. The contract is awarded under the Programme Prevention of and Fight against Internet Crime Targeted Call - ISEC 2011 Action Grants- Project Number HOME/2011/ISEC/AG/INT/ 4000002226. The author is the Project Manager and Principal Investigator for the project. ECENTRE forms part of a wider European network of centres of excellence to share expertise, promote best practice and provide training opportunities for law enforcement across the EU. The challenges in establishing effecting cooperation and sharing are discussed. The considerable problem of keeping pace with the fast-developing, complex, problem posed by threats to national infrastructure, organisations and individuals is examined; highlighting the role of education as a fundamental weapon in the fight.

Since IT infrastructures have become an integral part of almost all organisations, cloud computing will have a significant impact on them. Protecting sensitive critical infrastructure data in the cloud environment is the explicit focus of our work. The scale and dynamic nature of cloud computing cause challenges for their management, including investigating malicious activity and/or policy failure. Sufficient security metrics needs to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data on the cloud. Hosting critical infrastructure services in the cloud brings with it security and resilience requirements that existing cloud services are not well placed to address. The protection of critical infrastructure and data has been particularly highlighted with the increase of advanced persistent threats being designed to specifically target the systems that control these infrastructures. There had been a belief in the industry that even if these control systems had vulnerabilities, they were not actively being targeted, but this is now believed to be unrealistic. The severity of the control system specific malware and cyber attacks has led to an increased awareness and understanding from security vendors, as well as the government, both in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Gaining a deeper understanding of the infrastructure security needs is of utmost importance as there is currently a paradigm shift in assessing the extent of risks and protecting against zero-day vulnerabilities. To continue to offer safe and reliable services for public consumption, infrastructure providers need to recognise they have a problem and lack adequate tools, processes and experience to deal with it. It is inevitable that cloud computing will be introduced into their computing paradigm, and effective protection metrics need to be developed to deal with this revolution. Multiple intrusion detection activities have been introduced to address the issue of intrusion detection within cloud computing environments. Security, risk management, control, and trust are important issues that deter and holdback organisations from fully adopting cloud computing and profiting from its many advantages. Our research aims to develop a framework for the protection of critical infrastructure data in the cloud computing environment. We aim to develop a model that can be tailored to the different cloud environments, creating anomaly based intrusion detection techniques tailored to the specialist nature of the cloud computing environment. Our framework should provide monitoring of the network and have an improved detection efficiency based on the efforts in literature. It will be composed of network-based IDS, with a distributed architecture so that there is no single point of failure. The use of unsupervised learning methods will observe the behaviours of users within the network.","Anomaly based intrusion detection; Cloud computing; Control system; Critical infrastructure protection; Risk management; Security; Trust","Cloud security; Control systems; Critical infrastructures; Cybersecurity; Intrusion detection; Malware; Public works; Risk assessment; Sensitive data; Trusted computing; Zero-day attack; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Cloud computing environments; Cloud environments; Cloud-computing; Critical infrastructure protection; Infrastructure services; Intrusion-Detection; Risks management; Security; Trust; Risk management"

Smartphones, tablets, and other small form-factor devices are integrated in educational institutions, medical and commercial facilities with further military, governmental as well as industrial deployment expected in future. However, the complexity from interconnected hardware and software layers opens up multiple attack vectors for adversaries, allowing personally identifiable data exfiltration, malicious modifications of the device's intended functionality, pushing unauthorized code without user consent, or incorporating it into a botnet. Mobile threat landscape has become the next stage of cyberwarfare. Here, users unable or unwilling to adequately protect themselves make decisions based on information originating from untrusted third parties with potentially harmful intents. Recognizing the situation, a comprehensive array of tools and concepts such as ASLR, DEP, closing the source code, sandboxing, and code validation has been implemented. In this asymmetric security model, developers invalidate novel attack vectors while adversaries employ sophisticated techniques to thwart detection for large-scale penetration. The former are further penalized by heterogeneous base of software versions, some entirely defenseless against recent exploits. The paper presents an overview of techniques in current mobile operating systems and best practices the vendors incorporated to minimize unauthorized third-party modifications. It also aims to provide high-level description of exploits malware creators use to target users who, as we further postulate, underestimate capabilities of their devices. Best practices for safer use are briefly outlined, too.","Cyberwarfare; Exploit; Malware; Mobile; Security","Codes (symbols); Cybersecurity; Attack vector; Best practices; Cyberwarfare; Exploit; Malwares; Mobile; Mobile Technology; Security; Smart phones; Third parties; Malware"

The major challenge faced in the IdentityBased Cryptography IBC is that the integrity of Key Generation Center KGC is sometimes disputable, and the possibility of misuse of private keys of the user cannot be ruled out. This problem is well known as key escrow problem. Later, the newly emerged paradigm of CL-PKC has partially solved the key escrow problem. CL-PKC provides twofold benefits; one that the certificates are no more required in Public Key Infrastructure PKI and second that it takes care of the inherent key escrow problem in ID-Based cryptography. Recently, Zhang and Mao proposed a RSA-Based certificateless signature scheme and claimed that their construction is unique and secure in random oracle model. In this paper, we present a security analysis of their scheme and our results prove that the security of the scheme is not impregnable as suggested by the esteemed authors and can be compromised by using key replacement attack. ©2013 International Information Institute.","Certificateless public key cryptography; Cryptanalysis; Digital signature; RSA",""

Building Information Modelling (BIM) based technologies have emerged for communication, data exchange and sharing between project delivery actors within a virtual 3D environment, where analysis and management of sustainability indicators is aided by information driven software and systems. Significant challenges, however, exist in relation to characteristics and current capability of technologies to deliver effective exchange. The challenges broadly relate to lack of interoperability, security and lack of adaptable standards, which is exacerbated by increasing intensity, size and complexity of data requirements to meet evolving knowledge base for sustainability management through communication and information modelling. In addition to dire effects on efficiency, effectiveness and cost of mitigation, it is argued that a key consequence of these challenges is an increasing perception of risk in relation to implementation challenges, information security and data integrity, which is causing reluctance to use BIM for information exchange. Research agenda is proposed to ascertain the relative impact of the above issues on the supply chain attitudes towards information exchange, as a premise for establishing their impact on overall effectiveness of BIM in delivering acceptable outcomes for data exchange including quality and adequacy of shared data. © 2013 WIT Press.","Building Information Modelling (BIM); Construction projects; Digital data; Sustainability","construction; information and communication technology; modeling; sustainability"

It is a modernization of power distribution systems, and the introduction of information and communication technologies (ICT) is one of the means. Consequences include larger integration and larger connectivity, which lead to the power automation systems facing a whole new set of information security threats than before. It will be impossible to prevent all possible incidents from occurring. Therefore, the ability to appropriately prepare for, detect, and respond to, information security incidents, is of great importance. As a critical infrastructure the power industry is an attractive target for hackers. The threats are ever-changing, hence the industry needs to be prepared for the unexpected. Resilience engineering concerns adaptation to changes and disturbances and offers valuable principles and practices to the power industry in managing the unexpected. This paper investigates to which degree the power industry aligns with the principles of resilience engineering and suggests future steps to be taken in order to improve resilience towards information security incidents.

(2) What are the main scenarios of information security incidents that are expected to occur? (3) What is the decision process used for planning and selection information security controls? Current trends in technological advances impose new security requirements to information systems. This is true for all application domains, including military and especially concerning their unavoidable links to cyberspace. However, most of the time these information systems are specified under rules adapted to a different environment, what can result in unexpected and dangerous security flows. This study aims to evaluate how the military doctrine of the Portuguese Army limits or promotes the implementation of the international standard ISO / IEC 27001 (information systems security management) and simultaneously to propose a formal method for the selection and management of information security controls, based on that standard and aligned with the military organization. This Case Study consists of three phases: the first phase involves the collection and analysis of key documentation of the organization; in a second phase, a questionnaire was applied in the military organization, to three distinct groups - decision-makers, information security specialists, and employees with functions specifically linked to information use; and finally, in a third phase, interviews with specialists are used to validate the results obtained from the other phases. This study reveals that (1) information security within the military organization is built on the basis of physical and human attack vectors, and targeting the infrastructure that supports the flow of information in the organization (i.e. Information Systems), (2) the information security controls applied in the military organization are included in ISO 27001; (3) planning and selection of applied information security controls are made by decision makers and information security specialists, aiming to protect mainly integrity of digital information. It appears that specialists impose their planning options essentially inferring knowledge from analogies (like following guidelines), or rather, seeking to select and retrieve past successful information security cases, i.e. similar scenarios concerning situations under planning and that may (likely) lead to the selection and implementation of the most efficient information security controls.","Case studies; Information security management; Information security method; International standard ISO 27001; Military decision-making process","Decision making; Formal methods; Industrial management; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Management information systems; Security of data; Surveys; Case-studies; Decision-making process; Information security managements; Information security method; International standard ISO 27001; International standards; Military decision making; Military decision-making process; Military organizations; Security methods; ISO Standards"

This routing protocol has been extended to include the necessary parameters to perform the cryptographic operations at the nodes. Based on the cooperative neighbor and the short signatures technique, the proposed ECPDR scheme can not only detect and avoid but also can preserves the message privacy against elemental attacks and compound attacks.

Security efforts often focus on protecting against data loss, but an area which is often neglected is that of data being obtained surreptitiously without any trace of the acquisition remaining. This can happen during transfer or via an endpoint while the data is being worked on: often called 'shoulder surfing'. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of information being overheard or observed in public. So far, hard proof of significant business loss has remained elusive. The recent rapid increase in the uptake of photographically-enabled smart phones has exacerbated this risk. The casual sounding term 'Shoulder Surfing' is slowly changing to 'Visual Data Capture' (VDC) to reflect the fact that the data is no longer merely being observed or overheard but is now being captured in photographic format resulting in information capture. However, it is still challenging to quantify the degree of risk related to VDC as data is not removed or altered by the observer during acquisition. In this paper we report on the results of two experiments which set out to investigate the vulnerability of data on laptops and tablet devices to VDC. We address both capability and likelihood (probability) of such acquisition. The results deliver insight into the size of the VDC risk and suggests possible approaches towards mitigating it.","Information security; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Sensitive data risk; Shoulder surfing; Threat; Visual data capture","Mobile computing; Mobile security; Risks; Smartphones; Cellulars; High Speed; Mobile-computing; Organizational information; Sensitive data risk; Sensitive datas; Shoulder surfing; Threat; Visual data; Visual data capture; Sensitive data"

These new threats require new approaches for security of military networking. This paper proposes a cognitive service configuration model for tactical military networks. In the model, the user and other services are established and maintained dynamically by adapting the service configuration continuously. The dynamic environment of ICT services creates a moving target for an attacker causing the pre-prepared cyber attacks to be useless. The paper presents a functional architecture of the cognitive service configuration, and uses a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack as an example to demonstrate the features of the proposed cognitive service configuration. Some implementation challenges are also been discussed. The paper shows that the cognitive service establishment and maintenance is a promising approach to provide more protection on military computer networks and services, although there are still many details such as decision-making, and control mechanisms that require more research in the future.","Cognitive network; Phrases: cyber threat; Threat management","Cybersecurity; Decision making; Military communications; Network security; Cognitive network; Configuration modeling; Cyber threats; Cyber-defense; Interconnected computer; New approaches; Phrase: cybe threat; Service configuration; Tactical network; Threat management; Denial-of-service attack"

One of the reasons lies in a problem in security. It is easy to protect message on communication in terms of confidentiality when all of the nodes are under the control of one user. In such case as sensor networks, malicious nodes are out of consideration. However, when a network is open to the public, a matter of security would be complicated since attacks and falsification might occur inside the network. Furthermore, detection and elimination of malicious nodes are difficult on an unstable multihop wireless network where nodes continuously move and some of them frequently join or leave the network. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method for secure protocols to make an unstable multihop wireless network securely. The three elements in security are confidentiality, integrity and availability. In addition, we put a stress on authenticity and forensics on the network. The method contributes congestion control for unstable multihop wireless networks while keeping the network secure. © 2013 Infonomics Society.","Digital Forensics; Information Security; Wireless Communication","Electronic crime countermeasures; Network security; Security of data; Sensor networks; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Digital forensic; Malicious nodes; Multihop wireless; Multihop wireless network; Network secure; Secure protocols; Wireless communications; Sensor nodes"

War no longer seems to be about international politics and trade; instead, it is now perceived as a struggle within an omnipresent network which nobody is able to escape from. The different networks have enabled multiple actors - from states to non-governmental organizations, from individuals to the mafia - to organize themselves and cooperate. The globalization of the economy and the multiplication of information networks have also enabled and increased the probability of cyber attacks and propaganda. Encountering these kinds of problems demands comprehensive planning. The Western military today is not sufficiently organized, trained, or equipped to analyze, plan, coordinate, and integrate the full spectrum of capabilities available to promote national or global interests. The Western military is not the asset it should be in the security policy and crisis management. Security policy development and crisis management are not determined primarily by the military or by military interests, but by considering a variety of factors including social, economic, ecological, and cultural conditions. It is therefore normally not possible to guarantee security through unilateral national action, or with armed forces only. Given the complexity and interdependency of different actors and nations in crisis management, it is necessary to achieve greater harmonization among all appropriate actors in the analysis, planning, management, and evaluation of interventions in complex contingencies and emergencies. From the military perspective, there is a need for clear political guidance in crisis management, but also a need for operational freedom at every level. According to the German Army Command and Control Regulation, Auftragstaktik is based on mutual trust and demands from each soldier that, in addition to the conscientious performance of duty and willingness to achieve the objectives ordered, he or she is prepared to accept responsibility, to cooperate, and act independently and resourcefully in accordance with the overall mission. The command grants subordinated commanders freedom in the way they execute the mission. In crisis management, the military tries to turn political objectives into actions in the operational area. The military needs the freedom to communicate - in accordance with political guidance - with different audiences during the operation. Because there are many discrepancies in how communication takes place in different networks and because we increasingly use social media tools, we need synchronizing themes, messages, images, and actions that contribute to Strategic Communication across the joint force. These can be critical to mission accomplishment. Key Leader Engagement can help the military command avoid the crisis of perception management in the form of a ""say-do gap"" in a critical media environment. As a tool for implementing a communication strategy program, the employment of Key Leader Engagement cells has ensured that whenever commanders meet with leaders, they deliver an effective, consistent message that supports the command's goals. In this paper the Comprehensive Approach (CA) model is discussed as a continuum of the classical Auftragstaktik and the basic ideas of the Comprehensive Approach concept, such as Strategic Communication (SC), Key Leader Engagement (KLE), and Combat Camera (CC).","Comprehensive approach; Core narrative; Key leader engagement (KLE); Key leader enhancement (KLEN); Strategic communication","Complex networks; Information services; International trade; National security; Network security; Public policy; Security systems; Comprehensive approach; Core narrative; Crisis management; Cyber security; Key leader engagement; Key leader enhancement; Management tool; Perception management; Security environments; Strategic communication; Cybersecurity"

The purpose of this paper is to form a preliminary hypothesis about how to identify characteristics that a leader needs to focus when aiming cyber security leadership. First, the paper studies the key concepts and terms of cyber security. Then the paper outlines a structure and activities based framework for increasing understanding of required leadership in cyber context. The framework is derived from research on organizations and information technology. The framework models that activities are executed either in the physical or cyber world and they are occurring in one of those worlds. Recently, the activities executed in the cyber world and occurring in the physical world have gained most interest. An example is malware affecting on manufacturing systems or controlling systems. The paper analyzes the results of two limited media surveys about cyber related newspaper articles. Newspaper articles were published on one of the main newspapers in Finland during the years 2011 and 2012. The key findings of the first media survey showed that organization structures as well as norms and rules were not discussed. This means that it was not known or under general interest that what were the responsibilities and who was responsible of what. In addition, the internal integration of the community had no commonly agreed departure point. The second media survey showed that the internal discussions in society about the norms and rules of cyber activities and behavior were started. People want to what kind of norms will guide the world and how this cyber-physical world will be perceived in futures. A strong need to organize cyber world seems to be in front of us. However, the ways of integration of the various communities is still unclear. This means that the basic question is: Whom we want to let to lead us?","Cyber security theory; Cybersecurity; Governance; Information security","Behavioral research; Decision making; Malware; Manufacture; Surveys; Cybe security theory; Cyber security; Decision-making systems; Governance; Physical world; Security theory; Strategic communication; Structure and activities; System communications; Cybersecurity"

This new proposed new theoretical construct will not just be an update on Soft Power or Noopolitik, but instead will also include elements of Information Operations (IO) and the practical aspects of diplomacy and warfare. This new theory is all about the communication paths and changes in connectivity focused around a central theme that power has now been globally distributed. This is caused by the huge increase in access to information, for all people around the world, with increased connectivity and the ability to influence events far beyond the previous normal range. This new theory will therefore reference power and influence operations including the ability to shape the information in this new cyber era while still protecting the assets and maintaining the ability to get accurate and relevant information from multiple sources and channels. For what has changed in this new era is the range in which one person can extend the influence of their actions or ideas. This is evidenced in the increased rise in cyber attacks and the need to always be ready, with robust Computer Network Defense (CND) or Information Assurance (IA) efforts. Most succinctly, success in this era can be characterized by the ability to counteract or reject adversaries' global influence while still projecting your own. To succeed, one must maintain the required connectivity and logistics, to include networks, computers, and fiber, to ensure access, while isolating the adversary by countering his ideology propagation and cutting off communication access as well. Military theories in the past often focused on protecting interior lines of communications. This is still applicable in the information age, although the author's believe the focus is not about controlling the networks or information, but rather about ensuring open access and the free flow of data. It is critical to maintain continuous and ubiquitous connectivity, where horizontal integration across different organizations is a key ingredient of this new theory, with an emphasis on sharing vice closed, on open architecture, on open minds, all of which the authors believe equals total transparency.","Academic; Comprehensive; Cyber; Power; Strategy; Theory","Academic; Communication path; Comprehensive; Cybe; Information operations; New theory; Power; Soft power; Strategy; Theory; Network security"

The rises of the Internet phenomenon as well as the rise of terrorism make this control even stronger yet more subtle. Contrary to the common belief, the freedom of technology and science is just an illusion. Recently the emerging hacker phenomenon has upset and thwarted this balance between the need of freedom and the need of State security requirements. The main issue lies in the fact that these controls originally focus on homeland and international security purposes (e.g. protection against terrorism or mafia activities). But the fall of the iron curtain and of the Soviet block has dramatically changed the rules of the game. The enforced controls aim at first organizing an economic dominance of a very few Nation States (e.g. G- 8 countries) whose real intent is to organize the strategic dominance over the ever-growing technological societies. As an example (among many others), we could mention the case of Cisco vs Huawei/ZTE companies.

Such implementations however, are becoming less secure and practical, thus leading to an increasing interest in techniques related to biometrics systems. Biometrics systems are the systems which store physical properties of people in electronic environment and enable them to be recognized by the stored electronic information when needed. Biometrics is the identification of human. It works on the principle of identification of physical properties of a person which he or she cannot alter, are distinctive from others, can be used for identification, and are in his or her possession only. Extensive studies are conducted on biometrics techniques such as fingerprint, hand, face, iris, retina and voice recognition. Some systems have been developed, tested, and results have been obtained. Face recognition systems are among the most important subjects in biometrics systems. These systems, which are very important for security in particular, have been widely used and developed in many countries.

Once forensically detected, these same TTPs act as 'fingerprints' (called indicators), locating where the attackers have been elsewhere with a network of host computers. A very commonly used technique to locate compromised systems is to calculate the MD5 hash values for each file within a filesystem and compare against a known 'bad fingerprint' (hash value of known malware components). Our research demonstrates that of all of the indicators, the exhaustive computation of MD5 hash values across the full file contents of every file within the entire filesystem consumes the largest amount of time. Given the goal of reducing the time to determine if a system is compromised, we develop a novel approach to optimizing the creation of these indicators. Our experiments identify that computing a MD5 hash value of just the first four kilobytes (4KB) of each file provides a substantially faster method to search for specific MD5-based indicators with a very low false positive rate. © 2013 Infonomics Society.","Cryptographic controls; Search process; Security; Security, integrity, and protection","Computer crime; Design; Internet; Optimization; False positive rates; Host computers; Information security threats; Lateral movement; Search process; Security; Security, integrity, and protection; Sensitive datas; Security of data"

Among all database types, rational databases are very popular. Most of relational database management systems such as MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, MS Access, Postgres use SQL as their language. Flexibility of SQL makes it a powerful language. It allows the user to ask what information he wants without having any knowledge about how the information will be fetch. However vast use of SQL based databases make it the center of attention of hackers. SQL injection attack is a well-known security threat to database driven web applications. A successful SQL injection attack reveals critical confidential information to the hacker. In this paper first we provided background information on this vulnerability.

The asymmetrical threat posed by cyber-attacks and the inherent vulnerabilities of cyberspace constitute a serious security risk confronting all nations. In recent years attacks against critical infrastructures, critical information infrastructures and the Internet have become ever more frequent and complex because perpetrators have become more professional. Threats in cyberspace can be classified in many ways. This is evident when you look at cyber security on a multinational level. One of the most common models is a classification based on motivational factors. Most nations use this model as a foundation when creating a strategy to handle cyber security threats as it pertains to them. This paper will use the five level model: cyber activism, cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. The National Cyber Security Strategy articulates the overall aim and objectives of the nation's cyber security policy and sets out the strategic priorities that the national government will pursue to achieve these objectives. The Cyber Security Strategy also describes the key objectives that will be undertaken through a comprehensive body of work across the nation to achieve these strategic priorities. Cyberspace underpins almost every facet of the national functions vital to society and provides critical support for areas like critical infrastructure, economy, public safety, and national security. National governments aim at making a substantial contribution to secure cyberspace and they have different focus areas in the cyber space. In this paper the cyber security priority areas are in three categories: the public sector, the private sector and citizens. In this context the level of cyber security reached is the sum of all national and international measures taken to protect all activities in the cyber space. This paper will analyze the definitions, threats and objectives of the Cyber Security Strategies made by Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.","Cyber definition; Cyber security strategy; Cyber threats","Computer crime; Critical infrastructures; National security; Network security; Public works; Security systems; Terrorism; Cybe definition; Cybe security strategy; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Cyber-attacks; Cyberspaces; Daily lives; National governments; Security strategies; Technology revolution; Cybersecurity"

Watermark insertion and detection is done by K Map Minimizer. The crucial aspect of the proposed technique is the permuted bit pattern generation. The bit pattern is generated by first selecting unique rows and columns and solving the four attributes at the selected position through the K Map Minimizer to constitute a pattern. To make the bit pattern more secure permutation is applied before, where the size of the bit pattern is adjusted as per requirement. This unique permuted bit pattern is called the watermarked permuted bit pattern. Each bit of watermarked permuted bit pattern is added /subtracted while sub watermarking the selected attribute. Four secret keys and one permutation key are used which adds to the integrity of the technique. Secret keys are always used in pair so knowledge of a single key to an attacker, is of no use rather access to k-1 keys, where k is the number of keys, is also of not much worth as to generate a watermarked permuted bit pattern all four keys are requirement. Watermark detection routine is blind as it neither requires the original dataset nor the watermarked one. Watermarks are equally distributed in a very large dataset as six digits number is selected through K Map Minimizer, so the watermark can be detected even in a small subset of a watermarked relation as long as the sample contains some of the marks. Proposed technique is robust against various malicious attacks and updates to the data. Dealing with multiple tables adds to the practicality of the data. © 2013 IEEE.","data security and privacy; information security; K Map Minimizer; robust; sub-watermarking; watermarking","Digital watermarking; Security of data; Data security and privacy; Embedding watermarks; Large dataset; Malicious attack; robust; sub-watermarking; Watermark detection; Watermark insertion; Watermarking"

Existing methods do not scale well with the hundreds of millions of URLs encountered every day as the problem is a heavily-imbalanced, large-scale binary classification problem. Our proposed method is able to handle nearly two million URLs in less than five minutes. We generate two filtering models by using lexical features and descriptive features, and then combine the filtering results. The on-line learning algorithms are applied here not only for dealing with large-scale data sets but also for fitting the very short lifetime characteristics of malicious URLs. Our filter can significantly reduce the volume of URL queries on which further analysis needs to be performed, saving both computing time and bandwidth used for content retrieval. © 2013 IEEE.","Data Mining; Information Filtering; Information Security; Machine learning","Computer crime; Digital storage; Filtration; Information filtering; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Security of data; Big data applications; Binary classification problems; Content retrieval; Criminal activities; Drive-by-download; Filtering models; Large scale data sets; Processing method; Data mining"

Efficient healthcare is thus highly dependent on doctors being provided with access to patients' medical information at the right time and place. However it frequently happens that critical pieces of pertinent information end up not being used because they are located in information systems that do not inter-operate in a timely manner. Unfortunately the standard operational mode for many healthcare applications, and even healthcare institutions, is to be managed and operated as isolated islands that do not share information in an efficient manner. There are many reasons that contribute to this grim state of affairs, but what interests us the most is the lack of enforceable security policies for systems interoperability and data exchange and the existence of many heterogeneous legacy systems that are almost impossible to directly include into any reasonable secure interoperable workflow. In this paper we propose a RBAC mobile agent access control model supported by a specially managed public key infrastructure for mobile agent's strong authentication and access control. Our aim is to create the right means for doctors to be provided with timely accurate information, which would be otherwise inaccessible, by the means of strongly authenticated mobile agents capable of securely bridging otherwise isolated institutional eHealth domains and legacy applications. © 2013 IEEE.","Authentication; Health Information Systems (HIS); Information Security; Interoperability; Mobile agent; Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)","Authentication; Bioinformatics; Diagnosis; Electronic data interchange; Health care; Interoperability; Legacy systems; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Access control models; Health care application; Health care providers; Health information systems; Healthcare institutions; Public key infrastructure; Role-based Access Control; Systems interoperability; Mobile agents"

This advanced hardware and technology brings great convenience, however users are faced with a growing threat to their personal privacy due to various information security issues. This is especially true for the non-official APP markets which might provide malicious cybercriminals with a breeding ground from which to spread their malware and viruses targeting Android mobile devices. Due to their growing popularity, mobile phones and smartphones and tools for voice communication and information-passing may be endangered by the threats mentioned above once there is malicious eavesdropping malware which targets these smart mobile devices and they start to spread themselves. Regardless of whether users are passing information via a telephone network, their voices over Internet Protocol communication system, or simple text messages and email, malware will inevitably crop up, causing negative consequences which smartphone users must face due to the great threat to their personal privacy and information security. The very existence of Covert Channels on Android systems provides a pathway for stealthy data transfer between different Android APPs. Malicious Android APPs can utilize system resources such as screen brightness, volume and external storage to launch a covert channel communication. If no appropriate countermeasure is deployed, malicious Android Malware will use this approach to lower Android Permissions required to block each malware's entry, secretly transmitting/receiving private data, and jeopardizing smartphone users' privacy and information security. Therefore, we have to pay attention to these kinds of threats. In this paper, we analyze various scenarios and examine the possibility of android smartphones being eavesdropped upon by malicious APPs. For the purpose of experiment and analysis for our anti-eavesdropping framework design, we implemented a test malware which integrates VoIP technology and an Android covert channel. In our conclusion, we propose a malware eavesdropping countermeasure solution composed of a Covert Channel Detection Module and an Eavesdropping Behavior Analysis Module. Based on this solution, we implement an Android APP and prove that our APP can execute malicious eavesdropping behavior analysis using limited Android Permissions and mobile computing resources.","Android; Eavesdropping Trojan; Malware; Smartphone","Android (operating system); Android malware; Computer viruses; Data transfer; Digital storage; Mobile computing; Mobile security; Program processors; Security systems; Viruses; Android; Android systems; Behavior analysis; Covert channels; Eavesdropping trojan; Malware analysis; Malwares; Personal privacy; Smart phones; Trojans; Smartphones"

The focus is on detecting zero day malware. We describe a prototype security system that automatically identifies and classifies malware. The core technology is based upon manifold learning that uses diffusion processes, diffusion geometries and other methodologies that find geometric patterns that deviate from normality. The main technology core is based upon training the system to extract heterogeneous features, to cluster the normal behavior and then detect patterns that deviate from it which are malware anomalies. The proposed technology offers behavioral analysis of heterogeneous complex dynamic networking data to that maintains and preserves networks' health. The system uses efficient computation that is based on multiscale dictionary learning and kernel approximation, patch processing, adaptive subsampling and clustering and profile updating. These are universal generic core technologies for anomaly detections algorithms that are based on well founded deep unification between different mathematical theories from different disciplines that emerged recently.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for information hiding based on gray-scale digital images which considers the threshold of the pixel of an image while hiding the bits of a secret message in its least-significant-bits (LSBs). The proposed method works on the secret message by converting it into a stream of bits. Then we generate pseudo random numbers to provide a random distribution of the secret bits across the image. We use m-least significant bits of an 8-bit pixel to hold the secret bits. The value of m varies depending on the threshold of the pixels. The number of bits (m) to be embedded in a pixel having small threshold is more than that of a pixel having high or medium threshold. When we consider low and high thresholds we simply replace the m-least significant bits of a pixel with the m-secret bits. For medium threshold category pixels we use exclusive-or (XOR) of m-least significant bits of the pixel with the m-secret bits. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high embedding capacity and good visual quality of stego images for m=3 and m=2 for low and non-low thresholds respectively. © 2013 IEEE.","Digital Security; Information Hiding; Information security; LSB Matching; LSB Replacement; LSB technique; Threshold-LSB based Information Hiding","Communication systems; Information technology; Random number generation; Security of data; Digital security; Information hiding; LSB matching; LSB replacement; Lsb techniques; Pixels"

The increase in the online services and operations for various industries has led to an increase in different security threats and malicious activities. In US, the department of homeland security reported recently that there have been 200 attacks on core critical infrastructures in the transportation, energy, and communication industries (Erwin et al., 2012). This paper is concerned with the growing dependence of modern society on the Internet, which has become an ideal channel and vital source of malicious activities and various security threats. These threats could have an impact on different distributed systems within and across all the critical infrastructures, such as industrial networks, financial online systems and services, nuclear power generation and control systems, airlines and railway traffic controllers, satellite communication networks, national healthcare information systems ⋯ etc. The major problem is that the existing Internet mechanisms and protocols are not appropriately designed to deal with such recently developed problems. Therefore, a rigorous research is required to develop security approaches and technologies that are capable of responding to this new evolving context. This paper presents various security threats and incidents over the past recent years on different critical infrastructure domains. It introduces some security measures including vulnerability assessment and penetration testing approaches for critical infrastructure.","Critical infrastructure protection; Cyber security; Security threats and violations","Critical infrastructures; Nuclear fuels; Online systems; Satellite communication systems; Security systems; 'current; Critical infrastructure protection; Cyber security; Department of Homeland Security; Malicious activities; On-line service; Online operations; Security threats; Security violations; Threat activity; Cybersecurity"

The information systems may have legacy elements, even from the time when an internet connection was not common for every company. Today most companies are online all the time, and their internal systems are used in environments that are already or easily connected to the internet. The amount of devices connected to the internet is approximated to grow fivefold by the end of the decade (Evans 2012). The internet population is estimated to over two billion individuals at the moment (James 2012). Cyber threats are usually discussed from the perspective of national infrastructures and national safety. Although national infrastructure comprises organizational infrastructures, the operations of companies many times do not follow national borders. Companies operate in a truly global environment. Hence, the threats that companies face in their operations are not national, they are global. The weakest link in a global network may prove to be dramatic for the whole entity. Companies use information security policies and procedures as a tool to manage their information security. The policies usually address multiple threats that the information of the company is facing. Most of the threats addressed are direct threats to the company. Another type of threat is the use of one organization as a passage to another. The problem is to recognize the possible indirect effects and to prepare for them as well. The paper analyses threats and their potential effect on the operations of different companies with the use of scenario analysis. The scenarios are built based on a literature review on cyber threats. One outcome of the analysis is that to a company it is irrelevant where a cyber threat originates from and who it is targeted for. If the threat is specifically targeted to the company or if the threat is collateral in nature is not important; preparing for the threat is important in both cases. The paper discusses the pressures that the cyber threats pose for information security policies and raises a question of whether information security policies are used in companies to prepare also for cyber threats.","Companies; Cyber threats; Information security management tools; Security policy","Cybersecurity; Information systems; Information use; Online systems; Security systems; Cyber threats; Information security management tool; Information security managements; Information security policies; Internal systems; Internet connection; Management tool; National infrastructure; National safety; Security policy; Legacy systems"

In these approaches in-network services require access to various control data signalled in different ways to utilise the complete functionality of the orchestrated network. The diversity and amount of required control data rises progressively so that the communication endpoints have to allow more and more access to information about themselves. To ensure information confidentiality and integrity for two communicating end points, the de facto method applied so far is end-to-end encryption of information transferred between the two end points. However, in-network services have then no longer access to the encrypted control data and they cannot accomplish their tasks anymore. Thus, we can either ensure information security or establish smart in-network services. Our paper focuses on this dilemma and introduces an approach where we redesign the smart in-network services to blind but still smart ones that can still correctly process masked control data by using a new kind of cryptographic algorithms. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by redesigning the packet forwarding service to a blind one. Additionally, we present our prototype implementation of the blind packet forwarding and evaluate it. © 2013 IEEE.","blind in-network service; blind packet forwarding; Future Network security; masked control data; PEKS","Cryptography; Network security; Quality of service; Control data; Cryptographic algorithms; End-to-end encryption; In-network services; Information confidentiality; Packet forwarding; PEKS; Prototype implementations; Access control"

Multimedia security is already one of the most crucial problems in information science. Specially, as character of digital image, the standard cipher like DES and RSA don't seem to be appropriate for being applied to encipher the digital image. Consequently, the study of image encryption scheme attracts the interest of huge researchers. There are different techniques that have been enforced to get better the protection in the field of secret writing. In the existing system they have used many transforms such as DCT, Fourier, etc., along with scrambling. In this project, an efficient kind of image encryption scheme is presented by using a random permutation, rotation operation, cipher block chaining (CBC) technique being regarded for encryption. The parameters are random and serve as the key of this encryption method then the scrambling scheme of the pixels. The scrambling operation is based on the RGB planes in specified directions such as horizontal vertical, diagonal.

Systems under particular scrutiny include those involved in critical infrastructures and large public organisations. Recent high profile attacks and security breaches have highlighted the significance of security research. The increasing complexity of modern systems is largely due to the rising demand for functionality. However, systems are expected to retain their security, integrity and usability, which can often be affected by complexity. System-of-Systems (SoS) is a concept aiming to address these issues whilst increasing functionality beyond the capabilities of individual systems. It involves creating a large-scale decentralised super-system, composed of multiple independent component systems. Components voluntarily collaborate by pooling resources and sharing services, and are able to join, leave and change their contribution spontaneously. In complex environments, it is often necessary to lower security to achieve a compromise with functionality. This can lead to weaknesses being created or exposed. In an unpredictable SoS environment, which supports emerging behaviour, this is a major security risk, and is vulnerable to component misbehaviour. Real-time misbehaviour detection is a vital security feature of any SoS, requiring a solution that is lightweight and consumes minimal system resources, whilst providing adequate accuracy and indication of misbehaviour. However, the dynamic and uncertain nature of such systems, combined with their undefined boundaries, poses significant challenges. Many existing monitoring solutions and methods utilised in static systems are unable to function effectively in SoS environments. This paper presents our statistical anomaly detection based solution, to address the problem of detecting component misbehaviour on complex and uncertain systems in real-time. It is also able to make informed decisions regarding the degree of irregularity of anomalous behaviour. The paper also examines problems with existing solutions and presents some our promising initial results.","Component misbehavior; Monitoring; System-of-systems","Cybersecurity; Indium compounds; Network security; Personal computing; Real time systems; System of systems; Complex system of systems; Component misbehavior; Cyber warfare; Misbehaviour; Public organizations; Real- time; Security breaches; System composition; System environment; System-of-systems; Monitoring"

An extension of this right is the right to know i.e freedom of information which can be enjoyed only if there are sources from which the information can flow. Here comes into role the print media as well as audio-visual media. In the present era, with the advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), there comes into picture machines like computers and facilities like internet. Nowadays, cyberspace is put to maximum use for exercising the freedom of expression. Due to anonymous nature of cyberspace one can exercise the freedom of expression to the extent of defaming another. But one must understand that this freedom is not absolute and reasonable restrictions can be imposed upon it on certain grounds like defamation, privacy, decency, public order etc. The law of defamation addresses harm to a person's reputation or good name through slander and libel. The Internet has made it easier than ever before to disseminate defamatory statements to a worldwide audience with impunity. For quite some time, courts have been struggling with remedies for online defamation. The problem has been magnified by the difficulty in identifying the perpetrator, and the degree to which Internet Service Providers (ISP's) should be held accountable for facilitating the defamatory activity. This research paper contains a comprehensive study of laws of various countries dealing with cyber crimes in general and cyber defamation in particular. For example, Indian Information Technology Act, 2000 as amended by the IT (Amendment) Act, 2008; US Communication Decency Act, 1996; UK Defamation Act, 1996 An attempt has also been made to study the jurisdictional riddles involved in cases of internet defamation because internet is a global medium transcending across boundaries. It also focuses on the recent judicial pronouncements of High Courts and Supreme Court of various nations which have delivered landmark judgments for curbing the menace of cyber defamation.","Cyber space; Defamation; Internet service provider; Jurisdiction; Online","Computer crime; Computers; Crime; Cybersecurity; Web services; Audio-visual media; Cyberspaces; Defamation; Freedom of informations; Freedom of speech; Human rights; Jurisdiction; Online; Print media; Right-to-know; Internet service providers"

The majority of this effort involves the application of well known information security techniques to protect system networks. These techniques are primarily concerned with the prevention of unauthorized access and the protection of data integrity. While these efforts are important to protect the control systems that operate critical infrastructure, they are never perfectly effective thus motivating a need to develop control systems that will operate successfully during a cyber attack. Little research has focused on the design of control systems with closed-loop dynamics that are resilient to cyber-attack. An understanding of the types of modifications to the system and signals that could be employed by an attacker after they have gained access to the control system and the effects of these attacks on the behavior of the control systems can guide efforts to develop attack detection and mitigation strategies. To formulate this problem, consistent mathematical definitions of concepts within resilient control need to be established to enable a mathematical analysis of the vulnerabilities and resiliencies of a particular control system design methodology and architecture. In this paper, we propose rigorous definitions for state awareness, operational normalcy, and resiliency as they relate to realtime control systems. We will also discuss some mathematical consequences that arise from the proposed definitions. The goal is to begin to develop a mathematical framework and testable conditions for resiliency that can be used to build a sound theoretical foundation for resilient control research. © 2013 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Control systems; Research; Security of data; Closed loop dynamic; Control system design methodologies; Design of control system; Industrial control systems; Mathematical analysis; Mathematical definitions; Mathematical frameworks; Theoretical foundations; Control system analysis"

In this paper, we focus on the oscillation frequency of the integrated RC oscillators. In this paper, we use a keyboard as a device that includes a RC oscillator.

Assembling an ISMS consists of several difficult tasks, e.g., asset identification, threat and risk analysis and security reasoning. Moreover, the standard demands consideration of laws and regulations, as well as privacy concerns. These demands present multi-disciplinary challenges for security engineers. Cloud computing provides scalable IT resources and the challenges of establishing an ISMS increases, because of the significant number of stakeholders and technologies involved and the distribution of clouds among many countries. We analyzed the ISO 27001 demands for these multi-disciplinary challenges and cloud computing systems. Based on these insights, we provide a method that relies upon existing requirements engineering methods and patterns for several security tasks, e.g., context descriptions, threat analysis and policy definition. These can ease the effort of establishing an ISMS and can produce the necessary documentation for an ISO 27001 compliant ISMS.

The steganography concealed the information between the sender and receiver without causing any attention by third party. The encrypted algorithm transformed and substituted the hidden information. The encrypted message with secret key is transmitted via the communication channel. At the receiver side the weak encrypted message can be retrieved back effectively. Thus, we propose the image communication systems to secure the information by using a steganographic system and empirical mode decomposition method. Simulation results have confirmed that this combination model is highly robust against various signal processing operations and geometric attacks.

Cyber criminals are primarily targeting the human aspect of security, since end users are easier to manipulate. In order to effectively secure information, the fields of Usable security and User experience should be integrated in the design and use of security features.

Political unrest on international and local levels and recent technological developments increase the seriousness of threats against national security. The concept of security has evolved gradually, especially since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and end of the Cold War. The lingering impact of the policy of the bipolar world has blurred the image of relations between states. However, it provides an opportunity to understand and identify new threats and emerging conflicts, in addition to many unsolved problems. Simultaneously, globalisation has changed international rules and norms, in order to facilitate the rapid flow of capital and technology, with a weakening of national barriers. Non-governmental actors now play key roles in international politics, some as a threat, and others bridging the gap between communities and nations. In these circumstances, the role of the state began to suffer and the accepted traditional concept of power was challenged. Today, a major issue of such concern worldwide, arousing heated debate at both national and international levels, is terrorism. The threat of terrorism has never been as prominent as it seems to be at the present time. Terrorism is an old phenomenon that has existed since the emergence of human societies, but the threat of terrorism has increased steadily over the past 30 years. With technological and technical progress, the actions of terrorists have become more dangerous and destructive, while the perpetrators of such acts are becoming more elusive. There are few parts of the world that have escaped terrorism since late 1960s (Mythen and Walklate 2006). The phenomenon of terrorism is changing, while the motives of terrorism remain the same. The world today faces new and unfamiliar kinds of weapons. The international system, intelligence systems, security procedures and tactics which are expected to protect people, nations and governments, are not able to meet this new and devastating enemy. The methods and strategies developed to combat terrorism over the years are providing ineffective, as the enemy no longer attacks only with hijacked plans, truck bombs or suicide bombers. Terrorists may engage in cyber-terrorism, the use of cyberspace to launch attacks. The integration of the virtual and physical worlds, is a weakness confronting security agents (Collin 1996). This paper outlines a PhD proposal, which seeks to design an effective framework for the potential threat of cyber-terrorism on national security, compared with conventional terrorism by addressing three main themes: awareness-vulnerabilities-response, important in assessment of any security threat. According to Denning (2000) to understand the potential threat of cyber-terrorism, we should consider two factors: first, whether there are targets that are vulnerable to attack, and, secondly, whether actors have the ability and motivation to attack them. In this proposal a preliminary review of relevant literature will be introduced, followed by the research questions to be addressed and the proposed methods to address them. Then the expected time frame will be considered.","Cyber-terrorism; National security; Saudi arabia; Terrorism","Bombs (ordnance); Cybersecurity; Losses; National security; Cyber-terrorism; Economic loss; Loss of life; Number of peoples; Political unrest; Potential threats; Property; Saudi Arabia; Soviet Union; Technological development; Terrorism"

The event was a major success and provided Regis University with valuable recognition in the academic community focused on information assurance. The prevailing trends at the end of 2010, the interestingly-named Stuxnet malware, Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), and Smart Grid technology deployments, inspired the scenario for this cyber competition. Many government and industry-specific organizations have been stepping up efforts to heighten awareness amongst national organizations managing critical infrastructure, as well as authoring guidelines and policies for moving progress forward on secure infrastructure. In recent times, CIP has received much greater awareness by the United States Congress and other governmental agencies, such as the General Accounting Office (GAO), due to the trend towards ""connectedness"", with distribution and communications systems being increasingly connected over TCP/IP networks. CIP is especially important due to the far-reaching damage that can be suffered by businesses, industrial and government facilities, and the general populace in the event of a successful cyber attack. Simulating a true utility environment for the purposes of a cyber competition scenario is next to impossible due to resource constraints and unavailability of specialized equipment. However, the essence can be captured, and this is exactly what we strived for in the CANVAS cyber competition in 2011. Our primary goal was to introduce a CIP theme to a cyber competition in order to raise awareness of these types of attacks, especially since many power utilities across the nation are pushing Smart Grid infrastructure in order to offer value-added services to customers and increase efficiencies in power generation and distribution, which will inevitably increase complexity and connectedness of power utility operations and customer home area networks that can be exploited by motivated actors. This paper will discuss these goals as well as some of the intricacies of developing the CANVAS cyber competition, including technical details, extensibility of CIP-focused cyber competitions, as well as the continued development and value of CIP simulation infrastructure.","CANVAS; CCDC; Critical infrastructure protection; Cyber competition; ICS; SCADA; Virtualization","Competition; Critical infrastructures; Cybersecurity; Home networks; Integrated circuits; Malware; Network security; Public works; Smart power grids; Virtualization; CCDC; Computer and network vulnerability assessment simulation; Computer and network vulnerability assessments; Critical infrastructure protection; Cybe competition; Cyber security; Power utility; SCADA; Virtualizations; Electric power transmission networks"

Whilst many tools exist and much research is being undertaken, many questions exist regarding the future of the domain. Indeed, prior literature has widely published the challenges that exist within the domain, from the increasing volume of data (e.g. SANs, hard drive capacities, databases) to the varying technology platforms and systems that exist (e.g. tablets, mobile phones, embedded systems, cloud computing). However, little effort has focused upon understanding the reality of these challenges. The paper presents research that seeks to identify, quantify and prioritise these challenges so that future efforts can be concentrated on the issues that actually affect the domain. The study undertook a survey of researchers and practitioners (both law enforcement and organisational) to examine the real-challenges from the perceived challenges and to understand what effect the future will have upon the digital forensic domain. A total of 42 participants undertook the study with 55% having 3 or more years of of experience. 45% were academic researchers, 16% law enforcement and 31% had a forensic role within an organisation. Overwhelmingly, 93% of participants felt that the number and complexity of investigations would increase in the future. Apart from the plethora of findings elaborated in the paper, the principal future challenge priorities included cloud computing, anti-forensics and encryption. Respondents also identified, improving communication between researchers and practitioners and the need to develop approaches to identify and extract 'significant data' through techniques such as criminal profiling as essential. Interestingly, participants did not feel that the growth in privacy enhancing technologies nor legislation was a significant inhibitor to the future of digital forensics. © 2013 IEEE.","Cybercrime; Cybersecurity; Digital Forensics; Forensic Tools","Cloud computing; Electronic crime countermeasures; Law enforcement; Security of data; Surveys; Tools; Computer assisted; Cyber security; Cybercrime; Digital forensic; Forensic tools; Future challenges; Privacy enhancing technologies; Technology platforms; Research"

The latter are usually regarded as a central concept of cryptography, but the very existence of one-way functions depends on difficult conjectures in complexity theory, most notably on the notorious ""P NP"" conjecture. This is why cryptographic primitives that do not employ one-way functions are often called ""unconditionally secure"". In this paper, we suggest protocols for secure computation of the sum, product, and some other functions of two or more elements of an arbitrary constructible ring, without using any one-way functions. A new input that we offer here is that, in contrast with other proposals, we conceal ""intermediate results"" of a computation. For example, when we compute the sum of k numbers, only the final result is known to the parties; partial sums are not known to anybody. Other applications of our method include voting/rating over insecure channels and a rather elegant and efficient solution of the ""two millionaires problem"". Then, while it is fairly obvious that a secure (bit) commitment between two parties is impossible without a one-way function, we show that it is possible if the number of parties is at least 3. We also show how our unconditionally secure (bit) commitment scheme for three parties can be used to arrange an unconditionally secure (bit) commitment between just two parties if they use a ""dummy"" (e.g., a computer) as the third party. We explain how our concept of a ""dummy"" is different from the well-known concept of a ""trusted third party"". Based on a similar idea, we also offer an unconditionally secure k-n oblivious transfer protocol between two parties who use a ""dummy"". We also suggest a protocol, without using a one-way function, for the so-called ""mental poker"", i.e., a fair card dealing (and playing) over distance. Finally, we propose a secret sharing scheme where an advantage over Shamir's and other known secret sharing schemes is that nobody, including the dealer, ends up knowing the shares (of the secret) owned by any particular player. It should be mentioned that computational cost of our protocols is negligible to the point that all of them can be executed without a computer. © de Gruyter 2013.","Bit commitment; Mental poker; Multiparty computation; Secret sharing","Security of data; Bit commitment; Cryptographic primitives; Mental poker; Multiparty computation; Oblivious transfer protocols; Secret sharing; Secret sharing schemes; Unconditionally secure; Cryptography"

When an attack evades detection, it may disrupt the systems and networks, and then the need for survivability is more critical. In this context, mission assurance seeks to ensure that critical mission essential functions (MEFs) survive and fight through the attacks against the underlying cyber infrastructure. Survivability represents the quantified ability of a system, subsystem, equipment, process, or procedure to function continually during and after a disturbance. US Air Force systems carry varying survivability requirements depending on MEF's criticality and protection conditions. Almost invariably, however, replication of a subsystem, equipment, process, or procedure is necessary to meet a system's survivability requirements. Therefore, the degree of replication within a system can be paramount for MEF's survival. Moreover, diversity will prevent the same fault or attack from damaging all the replicas so that they can continue the mission. This research shows that the more dangerous vulnerabilities (that affect more replicas) in a system are sometimes less likely to be exploited. The attacker may be better off when exploiting small vulnerabilities because they will be less protected by the defender. In fact, diversity always gives extra challenges to attackers. This work uses the mathematical framework of game theory to show the significance of replica diversity for mission survival in cyberspace.","Cybersecurity; Diversity; Game theory; Replication; Survivability","Computers; Cybersecurity; Cyber security; Cyberinfrastructure; Cyberspaces; Diversity; Game-theoretic; Mission assurances; Replication; Survivability; U.S. Air Force; US Air force; Game theory"

Schools handle large volumes of sensitive information pertaining to educators, learners, creditors and financial records, which they are obliged to secure. Unfortunately, school management and users are not aware of the risks to their information assets and the repercussions of a compromise thereof. Computerised information systems are susceptible to both internal and external threats but ease of access is likely to manifest in security breaches, thereby undermining information security. One way of enlightening schools about the risks to their computerised information systems is through a risk management programme. Schools may not have the full capacity to perform information security risk management exercises due to the unavailability of risk management experts and scarce financial resources. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to educate secondary schools' management and users on how to perform a risk management exercise for their computerised information systems in order to reduce or mitigate information security risks within their information systems and protect vital information assets.

We develop an algorithm that monitors power flow results and detects anomalies in the input values that could have been modified by cyberattacks. Our algorithm uses principal component analysis to separate power flow variability into regular and irregular subspaces. Analysis of the information in the irregular subspace determines whether the power system data has been compromised. We verify the efficacy of the algorithm using both the IEEE 24-bus and 118-bus reliability test systems.

It is based on the concept that if the feature is revealed then it is liable to attack. Thus the main aim of steganography is to conceal the embedded data from eavesdroppers. Moreover it should maintain the quality of the carrier medium and anti-steganalysis should be hard to accomplish. This paper introduces a novel approach to image steganography which attains the above by performing mod-3 and stratification. To begin with, mod-3 operation is performed in each byte of the secret image. The result would either be a 0, 1 or 2. Based on the result that byte is placed in anyone of the three data files. As a result, three data files of the secret image are obtained. The carrier image is chosen and the three data files are appended below the carrier image one after the other. A pass-key is used for security purpose and it is also used as a delimiter between the layers. Text can also be encrypted and appended as one of the layers to the carrier image. The receiver receives the Stego image and performs the reverse process. The experimental result shows that the carrier image and secret image are independent of size. This is done after pointing out the related approaches and then highlighting this model's contributions with respect to the embedding and extraction processes. © Research India Publications.","Encryption; Image processing; Image segmentation; Image steganography; Information security",""

The easy coordination of disparate digital means of attack suggests we should move to tighter coordination between digital information assurance, psychological operations, and physical security. Examples at the physical end of the spectrum includes embedded Floating Point Gate Array (FPGA) computer chips that can be configured on the fly to function as completely different chips, 3D printers that can be used to bypass traditional physical security, hypervisors that virtualize complexity previously instantiated in hardware, and immersive communications environments where traditional physical facilities are being replaced. Digital technology also has a profound ability to monitor and induce behavior, opinion, and identity in ways that were not possible in previous eras. These include vivid multimedia production resources capable of inducing assumptions of events and facts in large populations, artificial intelligent systems capable of filtering of large volumes of communications for population behavior and also filter for patterns or persons of interest, and opportunities for highly engaging insertions of pseudonym contact and identity imprinting with low risk to operatives. Analyzing the behavior of a population and inducing behavior seem separate at first, but from the perspective of bit-induced reality and bit monitored reality, the two are ever closer. The author proposes that we re-assess vulnerability models to ensure that the natural integration occurring across a new Psy-BIR-Phys spectrum that tracks the level at which systems are a Bit-induced Reality (BIR) across a psychological-physical spectrum.

The notion of a cyber disarmament treaty is appealing as we begin to wrap our minds around the destructive possibilities in cyber, including the potential for civilian casualties of cyber dimensions of recognized armed conflicts-a traditional arena for treatymaking. In this paper, I argue that calls for cyberwarfare treaties miss the mark because they conflate traditional forms of force with the avenues that nation-state cyber actors are exploiting. In this, I differ from existing cyber treaty skeptics because my rationale hinges on the substantive nature of the cyber threat as one ill-suited to treaties. I agree with others' critiques that definitions in the cyber world remain vague, often haphazard or poor adjustments of kinetic world definitions. Yet the search for terminology to best address cyber threats and behaviors is not a problem particular to cyber disarmament. Another common critique of cyber disarmament is that we have no enforcing body. Similarly, I find this critique true but not necessarily unique- international law of all sorts faces problems in law enforcement. I contend that the reason a cyber disarmament treaty is not an appropriate tool to address the threat of cyberwarfare is that it fails to recognize that the most threatening cyber warfare concerns involve quiet but lucrative zero-day threats. A zero-day threat is a foundational ""hole"" in software or hardware that can be exploited before its existence is even known. Emerging research shows that zero-day exploitations last longer and the payload is significantly higher than that of traditional hacking. Because a cyber disarmament treaty could only effectively bind countries to behavior that is known to the other players, it would not bind zero-day hacks or the deliberate installation of zero-day vulnerabilities in products. The notion of a treaty derives from a sense that violence is knowable at the moment when a defector acts. Cyber warfare simply acts outside of that assumption much of the time.","Cyber disarmament; Supply chain integrity; Zero-day threat","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Supply chains; Zero-day attack; Armed conflict; Cybe disarmament; Cyber behaviors; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Cyber warfare; Cyberwarfare; Supply chain integrities; Zero day vulnerabilities; Zero-day threat; Personal computing"

This principle has been proven generally accurate and is routinely used for long term planning by the computer industry, which has led to an explosion in computing power and technologies that have catapulted computing into every aspect of human's lives in the 21st century. However, while new technologies increase the quality of life for the current generation, they also provide avenues for nefarious individuals to take advantage of others using the same new technologies. To help counter this, the IT industry has made great strides in its efforts to protect users by developing security appliances to include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, passwords, two-factor authentication methods, and a layered approach to security; to name just a few. It is because of this effort by the IT industry to help protect users, the authors have identified unique cyber attack trends, that could be referred to as a new ""Moore's Law"" (as it pertains to cyber security). As computer technologies become more sophisticated and robust, malicious actions have become less sophisticated, and in many instances, cyber exploitation and attacks occur without the use of technology. The authors have penned this concept as the ""Adam & Eve Paradox"". The paradox construct being, as technologies improve and network perimeters are hardened preventing direct attacks against systems, users and systems are being exploited at an exponentially increased rate by methods contrary to the technological improvements. Cyber criminals and hackers will always first attempt attacks against the easiest targets, known as the low-hanging forbidden fruit described in the biblical Adam & Eve story. While the IT industry continues to spend billions of dollars (US) annually to create appliances and develop software to protect its resources, data, and users; attackers are increasingly focusing their attention on the lowest hanging fruit, whether it be an unsuspecting user who clicks a link in an email, to a helpful administrator who provides information to a false authority. As the IT industry moves in the direction of complex defensive tactics, attackers are moving towards less complex - softer targets that are more difficult to detect, block, and mitigate. It is the authors' intention to define and substantiate the ""Adam & Eve Paradox"".","Adam & Eve; Cyber-attack; Malware; Moore's law; Perimeter defense; Social engineering","Authentication; Complex networks; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Computing power; Crime; Cryptography; Fruits; Intrusion detection; Network security; Personal computing; Adam & eve; Computer technology; Cyber-attacks; Exponentials; Guiding principles; Information technology industry; Malwares; Moore Law; Perimeter defense; Social engineering; Cybersecurity"

Differing from previous works, this method retains the quality of the carrier image and it doesn't depend on the size of the carrier image and shows better imperceptibility. To abate to the damage in the reconstructed carrier image, the secret image is divided into two segments, one with odd bytes and the other with even bytes.

The number of cybersecurity incidents affecting businesses of all sizes demonstrates that our current cybersecurity posture is not entirely successful and that businesses are slowly moving from a risk avoidance stance to a risk mitigation strategy. The business world is changing and few businesses are able to easily protect their assets within a known business perimeter, particularly with inevitable budget constraints. Technology changes such as cloud computing, e-business, teleworking and bring-your-own device (BYOD) increase the potential for vulnerabilities from attacks to the business information technology infrastructure throughout the supply chain. In addition, business changes such as global suppliers, outsourcing and offshoring, and the need to cut costs in all aspects of manufacturing and operations are creating new vulnerabilities. To respond to these changes, businesses must consider cybersecurity strategies that are not focused primarily on firewall and encryption techniques, as threats are increasing from ""trusted sources"" including employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Supply chain security is an important consideration that is not covered in most cybersecurity educational programs.

Yet, as mobile nodes change addresses, the critical points in the system that applications are set to communicate with, such as servers, cloud services, and peer registration servers, remain static and become easily identifiable.

This research shows that when using a prize phishing email, neuroticism is the factor most correlated to responding to this email, in addition to a gender-based difference in the response. This study also found that people who score high on the openness factor tend to both post more information on Facebook as well as have less strict privacy settings, which may cause them to be susceptible to privacy attacks. In addition, this work detected no correlation between the participants estimate of being vulnerable to phishing attacks and actually being phished, which suggests susceptibility to phishing is not due to lack of awareness of the phishing risks and that real-time response to phishing is hard to predict in advance by online users.

This paper presents recommendations and insights gleaned from over 100 security risk assessment (SRA) and process control analyses, using requirements baselines extracted from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special publication 800-53 (and Appendix A), the Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, in conjunction with NIST special publication 800-82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems(ICS) Security, to provide the bridge in application of 800-53 controls to IC/SCADA. The paper identifies how current and projected malevolent threats posed by insiders, outsiders, collusion, and system-induced threats can erode system performance in terms of shut downs, sabotage, production disruption, and contamination. The issue is not whether there are clear and present cyber threats, nor whether there are business prudent practices that can be implemented to counter those threats; but rather that there is such a diverse compendium, at times conflicting and often technically obtuse guidance, that clarity is needed to narrow the focus of this guidance to assist those responsible for implementing effective process control security. The paper focuses on application of business-prudent controls and discusses how disparities in implementation of controls can exacerbate system vulnerabilities. Topics include issues of processes control system management, systems documentation, use of contractors and remote contractor access, system authorities that exceed user needs, misalignment of staff perception of information asset values, exposures related to use of USB ports, lack of encryption, and background surety gaps for individuals and contractor companies with access to process control systems. The paper examines the dynamics of communicating information from process control systems to business IT systems and the pressure from business operations to capture process data and make it available in near real-time through administrative networks. Such pressures may influence systems administrators to overlook or ignore firewall and systems engineering architecture, increasing potentials for two-way interface between business and process control that significantly increases exploit exposures. Despite the availability of excellent guidelines for physical and technical security of IT related assets, these practices are too often unheeded in favor of expediency or expanded access. The paper includes a discussion of Risk Management Framework models that should be considered to enhance the correspondences and relationships between multiple organizational domains, thereby promoting more effective cyber security for current and future process control systems. The paper summarizes the process for establishing security for industrial control systems (ICS), and addresses cyber security baseline requirements and expectations, within a risk management framework that provides a decision basis, threat dynamics, common vulnerabilities, and prudent mitigation measures. Much of this summary has been derived from The Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and NIST SP 800-82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security. NIST has also published Applying NIST SP 800-53 to Industrial Control Systems which demonstrates the relationship of 800-53 to ICS security and the application of more than 20 control families and over 625 control elements to ICS security. Although originally designed for Federal systems, portions of these publications also provide a solid foundation for critical commercial and industrial information control systems in terms of addressing the basic questions that companies in the process industry should consider when selecting security controls, including: • What controls are actually needed to protect process systems, while supporting operations and safeguarding critical assets? • Can the selected controls suggested for Federal systems effectively be implemented for systems in the process industry? • Once selected and implemented, will these controls really be effective in protecting the processes? NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, helps answer questions to strengthen commercial processes information security programs. The security controls articulated in NIST SP 800-53 provide guidance and recommend practices applicable to security systems in process industries, to provide a foundation for understanding the fundamental concepts of security controls. The introductory material presents the concept of security controls and their use within well-defined information security programs. Some of the issues discussed include the structural components of controls, how the controls are organized into families, and the use of controls to support information security programs. The guide outlines the essential steps that should be followed to determine needed controls, to assure the effectiveness of controls, and to maintain the effectiveness of installed controls. The appendices in NIST SP 800-53 provide additional resources including general references, definitions, explanation of acronyms, a breakdown of security controls for graduated levels of security requirements, a catalog of security controls, and information relating security controls to other standards and control sets. The controls are organized into classes of operational, management, and technical controls, and then into families within each class. To maintain parity and applicability with advances in technology, NIST also plans to review and to update the controls in the catalog as technology changes and new safeguards and new information security countermeasures are identified. NIST SP 800-53 and related documents are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/index.html. The extensive reference list in SP 800-53 includes standards, guidelines, and recommendations that process industry companies can use as the foundation for comprehensive security planning and lifecycle management processes. Additionally, a significant effort of broad commercial and government cooperation, the Consensus Audit Guideline (CAG) provides a 20-element cyber security controls roster supporting a common commercial framework for cyber security, correlating to the NIST 800-53 Control Library. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Configuration management; Cyber risk assessment; Industrial control systems; Security controls; Security threats","Access control; Computer system firewalls; Contractors; Control systems; Cryptography; Human resource management; Identification (control systems); Information management; Information systems; Intelligent control; Knowledge management; Molecular physics; National security; Network function virtualization; Petrochemicals; Publishing; Real time systems; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Security systems; Standards; Configuration management; Industrial control systems; Information control systems; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Risk management framework; Security controls; Security risk assessments; Security threats; Process control"

Twelve purposively selected postgraduate students who used Facebook Mobile for exchanging learning resources and micromanagement of their daily lives were interviewed to unravel the influence of converged social media on students' lives. Identity construction and convergence as theoretical constructs were drawn upon to examine student narratives of their Facebook interactions and navigation of their identities.

Of most interest to national security is the role ICSs play in the management of critical infrastructure (CI) such as the national power grid, water treatment, and chemical industry. The control systems used in such sectors are developing into highly networked collections of distributed devices. Unfortunately, security has only recently become a topic of major concern for these devices. This leaves many implementations without secure configurations due to their long lifespan compared to the rate of advancing threats. In the paradigm of ICSs, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) represent the front line between the cyber world and physical systems. Attacks like Stuxnet have already proven the effectiveness of cyber-physical attacks by altering and disguising PLC programming, but the next generation of threats will likely focus on PLC firmware. Just as traditional computer malware evolved to hide itself using operating system-level rootkits, so will ICS attacks evolve to embed themselves in the PLC equivalent: the firmware. Since little research has been done in the area of PLC firmware security, this paper begins by addressing the related security concerns. One such concern is the application of digital forensics to a potential incident of ICS attack. Forensic investigations of digital devices have traditionally been limited to the analysis of typical computer systems like desktops or laptops. As forensic capabilities begin to expand into the scope of embedded devices like smartphones, parallels can be drawn to PLCs that will enable the development of more advanced forensic tools and processes. By performing a firmware analysis through reverse engineering, a PLC can be exploited for both malicious and forensic purposes. This paper discusses the techniques and procedures required to access, inspect, and manipulate firmware for an Allen-Bradley PLC to suit the purposes of the examiner. From this analysis, lessons can be learned not only about the capabilities and methods required by a potential attacker, but also about the accessibility and effectiveness of recovering PLC firmware for forensic investigation of a potential attack.","Embedded device; Firmware; Forensics; Industrial control system; Programmable logic controller; Threat assessment","Chemical analysis; Computer circuits; Controllers; Cybersecurity; Digital devices; Electric power transmission networks; Firmware; Malware; National security; Network security; Reverse engineering; Assessment investigations; Distributed devices; Embedded device; Forensic; Forensic investigation; Industrial control systems; National power; Power grids; Secure configuration; Threat assessment; Programmable logic controllers"

Organization managers must recognize the roles that organization insiders have in protecting information resources rather than solely relying upon technology to provide this protection. Unfortunately, compared to negative insider behaviors, the extant literature provides sparse coverage of beneficial insider activities. The few beneficial activities in the literature represent only a small portion of the diverse collection of insiders' protective actions. This research focuses on protection-motivated behaviors (PMBs), which are volitional behaviors enacted by organization insiders to protect (1) organizationally relevant information and (2) the computer-based information systems in which the information is stored, collected, disseminated, and/or manipulated from information security threats. Based on systematics, we propose a six-step methodology of qualitative and quantitative approaches to develop a taxonomy and theory of diversity for PMBs. These approaches integrate the classification techniques of multidimensional scaling (MDS), property fitting (ProFit), and cluster analyses. We leverage these techniques to identify and display how insiders collectively classify 67 unique PMBs and their homogeneous classes. Our taxonomy provides researchers and practitioners a comprehensive guide and common nomenclature for PMBs. Our methodology can be similarly used to create other theories of diversity.","Behavioral information security; Cluster analysis; Multidimensional scaling; Protection-motivated behaviors; Systematics; Taxonomy; Theory of diversity","Cluster analysis; Security of data; Security systems; Behavioral information security; Multi-dimensional scaling; Protection-motivated behaviors; Systematics; Theory of diversity; Taxonomies"

The unique aspect of the OCIF project was the autonomy in which, once released, the program would complete a mission or set of goals without user intervention or support through traceable proxy services. One requirement not addressed was identified by the author that would be required to allow such a system to be successful; the ability to recover from a counter attack or adverse affect and re-spawn as a viable system. In the following paper the authors review the OCIF framework, requirements for resiliency, and outline their solution for this additional capability that will provide autonomous functional resiliency for an OCIF-based tool. Advancements in cyber security, to include the ability for network security companies and government agencies to identify and mitigate new or legacy attacks, have significantly decreased the life span of exploits and attack tools. Coupled with more robust operating systems, and a generation of better educated system administrators, the longevity of any attack tool can be measured in hours rather than days. If a unique attack exploit or methodology is developed it is often withheld; for once it is released it will rapidly be countered or defeated. Furthermore, the releasing organization engaging in cyber warfare will wish to remain anonymous in order to prevent political fallout or a retaliatory attack. Polymorphism and code mutation have been key components in successful attacks, but for a tool to continue a specific mission, resiliency will need to be developed into the tool's framework. Often touted as a system requirement, resiliency is rarely achieved in software projects due to the cost in time and other resources. The least complicated and least expensive method of resiliency is achieved through redundancy of systems, providing immediate failsafe measures should an adverse condition arise at an alternate operating location (AOL). Unfortunately, an autonomous system with the requirement to remain anonymous cannot afford to be duplicated throughout the World Wide Web or be linked to multiple AOLs, as multiple instances (especially static instances) would amplify the systems' exposure to an adversary. The author's solution is a cloud-based non-traditional redundant array of independent disks (RAID) that will allow an autonomous tool to replicate itself using concatenation of a large span of disks. The necessary disk space is acquired through easily exploited systems throughout the cloud. Each span or node is separated from other nodes and wholly contained, allowing one node to be corrupted or discovered without affecting other nodes. In this way an OCIF-based system will survive counter attacks, reconstitute, and the new instance will continue the mission. The authors will discuss the various methods of RAID and demonstrate through a simulated cloud environment their solution and results.","Autonomous cyber warfare; Cloud RAID; Functional resiliency; RACS; RAIC; Re-spawn","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Autonomous cybe warfare; Cloud redundant array of independent disk; Cyber warfare; Functional resiliency; Information warfare; RACS; RAIC; Re-spawn; Redundant array of independent disks; Tool development; Network security"

Typically, national strategies call for the establishment of a cyber operations unit capable of computer network defence, exploitation, and, in some nations, attack. The cyber operations unit will be manned by professionals and operate under government authority compliant with national and international law. Our research focuses on offensive cyber operations (i.e. computer network exploitation and attack). The cyber unit must be provided with the right resources, in the form of accommodation, computing and networking infrastructure, tools and technologies, doctrine, and training. The open literature gives an unbalanced view of what tools and technologies a professional group needs because it emphasizes malware and, to a lesser extent, the delivery media used by cyber criminals. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to identify systematically the tools and technologies needed for professional, offensive cyber operations. A canonical model of the cyber attack process was enhanced by adding control inputs and mechanisms, and tools and technologies were extracted from these mechanisms. Both the enhanced model and the set of tools and technologies have been checked by a subject matter expert.","Attack; Canonical process model; Offensive cyber operations; SADT; Technologies; Tools","Computer networks; Crime; Malware; Network security; Professional aspects; Attack; Canonical process; Canonical process model; Cyber operations; Offensive cybe operation; Operations units; Process-models; SADT; Technology; Tools and technologies; Cybersecurity"

In an RBAC system, a user's legitimate access may be denied if their need has not been anticipated by the security administrator at the time of policy specification. Alternatively, even when the policy is correctly specified an authorised user may accidentally or intentionally misuse the granted permission. The heart of the challenge is the intrinsic unpredictability of users' operational needs as well as their incentives to misuse permissions. In this paper we propose a novel Budget-aware Role Based Access Control (B-RBAC) model that extends RBAC with the explicit notion of budget and cost, where users are assigned a limited budget through which they pay for the cost of permissions they need. We propose a model where the value of resources are explicitly defined and an RBAC policy is used as a reference point to discriminate the price of access permissions, as opposed to representing hard and fast rules for making access decisions. This approach has several desirable properties. It enables users to acquire unassigned permissions if they deem them necessary. However, users misuse capability is always bounded by their allocated budget and is further adjustable through the discrimination of permission prices. Finally, it provides a uniform mechanism for the detection and prevention of misuses. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, they are all faced with a challenge regarding gaining and maintaining consumer trust in a volatile cloud-based e-commerce environment where risks pertaining to information security, privacy of information and inadequate monitoring of compliance to applicable laws are prevalent. The pervasiveness of these risks has indirectly propelled the development of web assurance models, which were designed in an attempt to encourage online consumer trust. Regrettably, many of these models have been inadequate in certain areas, such as being unable to provide online real-time assurance on a comprehensive set of attributes, which include a check of compliance to the applicable e-commerce legislation or standards in a cloud-based environment. The aim of this research was to examine whether the integration of the attributes of adaptive legislation, adaptive ISO standards, policies, advanced user security and website availability can be used to develop a compliant assurance model. The model uses an intelligent cooperative rating based on the analytical hierarchy process and page ranking techniques to improve the level of cloud-based trustworthiness.

Attacks that impact the operations of these critical assets could have devastating consequences. Yet, the complexity and desire to interconnect ICS components have introduced vulnerabilities and attack surfaces that previously did not exist. Cyber attacks are increasing in sophistication and have demonstrated an ability to cross over and create effects in the physical domain. Most notably, ICS associated with the critical infrastructure have proven susceptible to sophisticated, targeted attacks. The numerous communication paths, various ingress and egress points, diversity of technology and operating requirements provide myriad opportunities for a motivated adversary. Indeed, the complex systems enable both traditional and nontraditional attack surfaces. Current defense strategies and guidelines focus on defense-in-depth as a core component to protect critical resources. System security relies on multiple protection mechanisms to present an attacker with various challenges to overcome. This strategy, however, is not adequate for safeguarding critical assets against sophisticated attacks. This paper analyzes current ICS defense strategies and demonstrates that defense-in-depth alone is not a successful means for preventing attacks. Findings indicate that a paradigm shift is required to thwart advanced threats. As an alternative, cyber security for ICS is examined from the notion of weakest link as opposed to the current recommended strategies. Recent examples, including Stuxnet, are examined to shed light on the next-generation targeted attack in the context of current defensive strategies. The results demonstrate that current defense-in-depth strategies are necessary but not sufficient.","Critical infrastructure protection; Defense-in-depth limitations; ICS security","Cybersecurity; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Gas industry; Integrated circuits; Network security; Petroleum transportation; Public utilities; Public works; 'current; Control system security; Critical asset; Critical infrastructure protection; Defense strategy; Defense-in-depth limitation; Industrial control system security; Industrial control systems; System control; Systems monitor; Critical infrastructures"

The proliferation of key management systems or protocols also results in higher operational and infrastructure costs, and fails in interoperability. Thus, it is essential to realize key management interoperability between different and heterogeneous cryptosystems. This paper presents a practical and separable key management system for heterogeneous public-key cryptosystems. We achieve the interoperability between different cryptosystems via cryptography approaches rather than communication protocols. With our scheme, each client can freely use any kind of cryptosystem that it likes. The proposed scheme has two advantages over the key management interoperability protocol introduced by the organization for the advancement of structured information standards. One is that all the related operations do not involve the communication protocol and thus no special restrictions are taken on the client devices. The other is that the proposed scheme does not suffer from single-point fault and bottleneck problems. © 2013 KICS.","Heterogeneous public-key cryptosystems; Information security; Key management interoperability","Information management; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Communications protocols; CryptoGraphics; Heterogeneous public-key cryptosystem; Infrastructure costs; Key distribution; Key management interoperability; Key management protocols; Key management systems; Key-management; Public key cryptosystems; Interoperability"

Their competing interests, the profit motive and national security, have historically impeded any sharing of cyber attack information or defensive tools and strategies. As most critical infrastructure in the US is owned and managed by private companies, lacking access to corporate networks and being unable to compel companies to report cyber events prevents the government from collecting sufficient data on attacks to analyse and develop better defences. The cost of this inability is the continued rate of loss of monies from hacked financial data; loss of work product from billions of dollars of research and development loss; loss of future economic competitiveness as a result of lost future earnings on that work product; and threats to future military dominance and national security from the theft of intellectual property. To overcome the competing drivers of the public and private sector for a workable partnership on cyber defence, there must be better incentives for companies to share cyber event information. Lack of data is the leading impediment to meaningful analysis of trends and anomalies in cyber events. While industry-specific voluntary reporting associations have attempted to attract companies to report breaches in exchange for analytical products from that data, competition concerns lead companies to underreport, not report, and/or free-ride the system, resulting in a narrow pool of data. Market tools like insurance have been posed as a possible solution, but its purpose is primarily risk redistribution and indemnification of losses. Companies are only self-interested in reporting events for which there is coverage and resist full access to networks by insurance auditors for data breach assessment out of privacy and security concerns. Neither solution accounts for the desire of businesses to protect shareholder value and brand reputation by concealing data breaches. A potential solution would be a national cyber event database to which companies could anonymously submit relevant cyber event information for analysis, without revealing identifying information that might compromise corporate interests. By decreasing the risk of information sharing by addressing privacy concerns, while offering the benefits of information sharing and analysis, this system could vastly increase the size and scope of data collection.","Cyber security cooperation; Data breach reporting; Incident management","Competition; Critical infrastructures; Data acquisition; Information analysis; Information dissemination; National security; Network security; Risk assessment; Cybe security cooperation; Cyber security; Cyber-defense; Data breach reporting; Incident Management; Information sharing; Private sectors; Public-private; Security cooperation; Work products; Cybersecurity"

The trick involves an intruder connecting to a victim indirectly through a sequence of hosts called stepping-stone, which makes network managers difficult to detect the intrusion, often results in serious injuries. In this study, a detection method of stepping-stone based on the association rule mining of network traffic records is proposed. The association rules establish a model for detecting stepping-stones in accordance with collecting the connecting records in the governed network. Test records are gathered from the source and destination addresses of Internet protocol in a fixed time interval, which are then analyzed with the association rules algorithm to filter out the transmission characteristics of stepping-stone attacks. In the experimental results, empirical evaluation under 5min of test records shows that the accuracy rate, the precision rate, and the recall rate are 83.81%, 84.26%, and 83.16%, respectively. When the test record gathering time is extended to 20min, with the same detecting method, the three evaluations achieve 99.9%.

Today, it is estimated as many as 27 million people around the world are victims of trafficking into the sex trade and other forms of servitude known as modern slavery or trafficking in persons. ""Trafficking in persons"" and ""human trafficking"" has been used by the U.S. Department of State and other governmental and multinational organizations as umbrella terms for the act of recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining a person for compelled labor or commercial sex acts through the use of force, fraud, or coercion. Recent research reflects that the exploitation of people through trafficking, is being channeled heavily through cyber activity such as Internet service, local bulletin board service, or any device capable of electronic data storage or transmission including social networking sites like Craig's List, Facebook, MySpace, and email instant messaging, text messaging, fictitious employment advertisements, immigration assistance and online bride websites. The goals of the research include: (1) identifying some of the key present challenges in cybertrafficking investigations, (2) understanding the impact of cybertrafficking in our society, locally, nationally and globally; and (3) assessing the role of the private sector in regulating the Internet for human trafficking activity. Presently, human trafficking scholarship and education is in its early stages particularly as it relates to understanding victim protection and assistance, technological, evidentiary and surveillance issues and international legal frameworks for the prevention of human trafficking. Greater awareness and education is needed to assist in the challenges faced by our Executive and Legislative Branches as they address important issues of national security and the growing incidence of cybercrime. This paper will introduce common law legal doctrines, procedural and evidentiary tools, forensic analysis, and case studies that will assist in creating a deeper understanding of the impact of cyber activity on the human trafficking industry in the effort to find greater solutions for the prevention, prosecution and protection of the innocent from the growing incidence of cyber activity as it relates to human trafficking around the globe.","Cybercrime; Cyberlaw; Human trafficking; Modern slavery","Computer crime; Crime; Cybersecurity; Digital storage; Gateways (computer networks); National security; Network security; Social networking (online); Cyber-crimes; Cyberlaw; Data-transmission; Department of state; Electronic data storage; Human trafficking; Internet-services; Modern slavery; Multinational organizations; Recent researches; Text messaging"

The χ2 detection and Regular-Singular (RS)-attack methods are two well known statistical steganalysis schemes used against LSB (least significant bit) steganography. The embedded message length can be estimated accurately by these two steganalysis schemes. For secret communication, the resistance of steganography against steganalysis is very important for information security. To avoid the enemy's attempts, the statistical features between stego-images and cover images should be as similar as possible for better resistance to steganalysis. To ensure the security against the RS and χ2 analysis, we presents in this paper a new steganographic method based on graph coloring problem (GCP). Before embedding the secret message in LSB (least significant bit) of the cover image, we use a (GCP) algorithm to locate the optimal positions of the pixels in the cover image. Thus, the existence of the secret message is hard to be detected by the RS analysis. Meanwhile, better visual quality can be achieved by the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness in resistance to steganalysis with better visual quality. © 2013 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.","Graph coloring; Heuristic DBG; LSB method; Steganography",""

We have designed and implemented a prototype technology platform for providing home-based healthcare services. It supports a personal electronic health diary and enables secure and reliable communication and interaction with peers and healthcare personnel. The platform runs on a small computer with a dedicated remote control. It is connected to the patient's TV and to a broadband Internet. The platform has been tested with home-based rehabilitation and education programs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. As part of our work, a risk assessment of privacy and security aspects has been performed, to reveal actual risks and to ensure adequate information security in this technical platform. Methods. Risk assessment was performed in an iterative manner during the development process. Thus, security solutions have been incorporated into the design from an early stage instead of being included as an add-on to a nearly completed system. We have adapted existing risk management methods to our own environment, thus creating our own method. Our method conforms to ISO's standard for information security risk management. Results: A total of approximately 50 threats and possible unwanted incidents were identified and analysed. Among the threats to the four information security aspects: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and quality; confidentiality threats were identified as most serious, with one threat given an unacceptable level of High risk. This is because health-related personal information is regarded as sensitive. Availability threats were analysed as low risk, as the aim of the home programmes is to provide education and rehabilitation services; not for use in acute situations or for continuous health monitoring. Conclusions: Most of the identified threats are applicable for healthcare services intended for patients or citizens in their own homes. Confidentiality risks in home are different from in a more controlled environment such as a hospital; and electronic equipment located in private homes and communicating via Internet, is more exposed to unauthorised access. By implementing the proposed measures, it has been possible to design a home-based service which ensures the necessary level of information security and privacy. © 2013 Henriksen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Confidentiality; Diabetes self-management education; Information security; Privacy; Pulmonary rehabilitation; Risk assessment; Tele-homecare; Video conference","Chronic Disease; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; Home Care Services; Humans; Models, Statistical; Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care); Patient Education as Topic; Qualitative Research; Risk Assessment; United States; article; chronic disease; computer security; confidentiality; health insurance; home care; human; legal aspect; methodology; patient education; qualitative research; risk assessment; standard; statistical model; treatment outcome; United States; chronic disease; legislation and jurisprudence; procedures; risk assessment; standards"

However, knowledge protection and security-oriented knowledge management processes related to SM have received little attention in previous studies. This research attempts to close that gap by examining which information and knowledge protection challenges arise from employees' use of SM, why they arise, and how organizations can address them. The main contribution of this study is a framework that integrates three types of knowledge protection challenges (information security challenges; reputation challenge; management challenges) with five special characteristics of SM (information distribution speed; blurry audience; merging of private and professional identity; easily collectible information; generation transition), which explain why these challenges arise. In addition, the framework presents eight questions that organizations should answer to help them address the three types of knowledge protection challenges. Our findings have practical implications: by answering the eight questions proposed in this study, companies can create knowledge management and protection policies for SM.

Medium luminance districts of carrier image are supposed to unavailable districts without hiding information. High-frequency coefficients approaching subgraph of discrete wavelet transform of carrier image are chosen to hide information and diagonal high-frequency coefficients approaching subgraph is prior choice. The variance of partial subgraph is defined as imbedding coefficient. The positions to hide information are determined by noise sensitivity model ωθ(i,j) of high-frequency subgraph. The quality decline of the result image is unapparent compared with carrier image owing to sufficiently considering the visual masking effect. The proposed method is proved to be a valid approach for improving the imperceptibility of information hiding method via computer simulation and leading to a good hiding result. Meanwhile the method can effectively resist the influence of noise, cutting, compression and other attacks.

The process of memory acquisition presents unique evidentiary challenges since many acquisition techniques require code to be run on a potential compromised system, presenting an avenue for anti-forensic subversion. In this paper, we examine a number of simple anti-forensic techniques and test a representative sample of current commercial and free memory acquisition tools. We find that current tools are not resilient to very simple anti-forensic measures. We present a novel memory acquisition technique, based on direct page table manipulation and PCI hardware introspection, without relying on operating system facilities - making it more difficult to subvert. We then evaluate this technique's further vulnerability to subversion by considering more advanced anti-forensic attacks. © 2013 Josiah Dykstra and Alan T. Sherman. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Organizations and individuals are struggling to keep up with the onslaught It is commonly accepted that humans are the weakest link and the cause of many security breaches. Therefore, it is essential that individuals need to become aware, knowledgeable, and educated regarding these related threats. They also need to be motivated and influenced to behave and act more securely. This paper discusses the idea of a personal information security agent (PISA) that assists in achieving this and presents a framework for the development of such an agent. The framework considers various aspects and makes recommendations with regard to persuading users to a more security-conscious behaviour. It specifies a set of criteria that have been established through a technical review of a functional software prototype as described by the IEEE 1028 Standard for Software Reviews. These criteria include functions, such as to educate users; and additionally, supporting characteristics, such as usability and context sensitivity. This research therefore investigated the criteria mat should be considered in the development of a PISA and if such an agent has the potential to influence users. Findings suggest that a PISA based on these criteria is a plausible alternative for influencing computer users towards more secure behaviour. © 2013 International Information Institute.","Human behaviour; Human computer interaction; Information security; Information security awareness; Persuasive technology",""

Recently, a game-theory approach has been widely employed to investigate this issue, including the optimal configurations of the detection software. However, for both the firm and the user, inaccuracies may persist in the gap between strategic decisions and actual actions, due to the effects of irrationality and the error-prone nature of the devices that carry their commands. This paper analyzes the effects of decision errors on the optimal strategies of both the firm and the user and, in particular, on the optimal configurations of the detection software. We finally demonstrate that decision errors can promote several pure equilibrium strategies and that fine-tuning these configurations quickly becomes difficult. Furthermore, we find that decision errors can drastically influence the optimal configurations and expected costs for a firm. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Decision errors; Detection software; Game-theory; Intrusion detection systems","Game theory; Industry; Security of data; Decision errors; Detection software; Equilibrium strategy; Expected costs; Heterogeneous features; Intrusion Detection Systems; Optimal strategies; Strategic decisions; Errors"

This paper aims at analysing the existence and quality of AT, describing scenarios in hospitals and making some recommendations to improve the quality of information. Methods. The responsibles of HIS for eight Portuguese hospitals were contacted in order to arrange an interview about the importance of AT and to collect audit trail data from their HIS. Five institutions agreed to participate in this study; four of them accepted to be interviewed, and four sent AT data. The interviews were performed in 2011 and audit trail data sent in 2011 and 2012. Each AT was evaluated and compared in relation to data quality standards, namely for completeness, comprehensibility, traceability among others. Only one of the AT had enough information for us to apply a consistency evaluation by modelling user behaviour. Results: The interviewees in these hospitals only knew a few AT (average of 1 AT per hospital in an estimate of 21 existing HIS), although they all recognize some advantages of analysing AT. Four hospitals sent a total of 7 AT - 2 from Radiology Information System (RIS), 2 from Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), 3 from Patient Records. Three of the AT were understandable and three of the AT were complete. The AT from the patient records are better structured and more complete than the RIS/PACS. Conclusions: Existing AT do not have enough quality to guarantee traceability or be used in HIS improvement. Its quality reflects the importance given to them by the CIO of healthcare institutions. Existing standards (e.g. ASTM:E2147, ISO/TS 18308:2004, ISO/IEC 27001:2006) are still not broadly used in Portugal. © 2013 Cruz-Correia et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Adult; Hospital Information Systems; Hospitals; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Medical Audit; Portugal; adult; article; hospital; hospital information system; human; medical audit; Portugal; psychologic test; standard"

However, moving patients' medical information to the Cloud implies several risks in terms of the security and privacy of sensitive health records. In this paper, the risks of hosting Electronic Health Records (EHRs) on the servers of third-party Cloud service providers are reviewed. To protect the confidentiality of patient information and facilitate the process, some suggestions for health care providers are made. Moreover, security issues that Cloud service providers should address in their platforms are considered. Objective: To show that, before moving patient health records to the Cloud, security and privacy concerns must be considered by both health care providers and Cloud service providers. Security requirements of a generic Cloud service provider are analyzed. Methods: To study the latest in Cloud-based computing solutions, bibliographic material was obtained mainly from Medline sources. Furthermore, direct contact was made with several Cloud service providers. Results: Some of the security issues that should be considered by both Cloud service providers and their health care customers are role-based access, network security mechanisms, data encryption, digital signatures, and access monitoring. Furthermore, to guarantee the safety of the information and comply with privacy policies, the Cloud service provider must be compliant with various certifications and third-party requirements, such as SAS70 Type II, PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, and the US Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). Conclusions: Storing sensitive information such as EHRs in the Cloud means that precautions must be taken to ensure the safety and confidentiality of the data. A relationship built on trust with the Cloud service provider is essential to ensure a transparent process. Cloud service providers must make certain that all security mechanisms are in place to avoid unauthorized access and data breaches. Patients must be kept informed about how their data are being managed.","Cloud-computing; EHealth; Electronic health records (EHRs); Privacy; Security","Computer Security; Information Management; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Privacy; cloud-computing; eHealth; electronic health records (EHRs); privacy; security; article; cloud-computing; computer security; electronic health records (EHRs); electronic medical record; information system; privacy; security; telehealth"

Interestingly, researchers have found mixed results when attempting to associate reports of information security breaches with changes in the affected firm's stock price. This research delves further into this puzzle by investigating the association between the textual contents of information security breach media reports and the stock price, as well as the trading volume reactions of the affected firm(s) around the breach announcement day. Our findings suggest that when the textual contents of breach reports provide more detailed information regarding the incidents, a more consistent belief is formed by the market about the negative impact of the reported security incident on the firm's business value. However, when there is a lack of specific information regarding the reported breach, the market does not seem to reach consensus on the impact of reported security incidents. We further demonstrate that different perceptions exist among general and sophisticated investors regarding the impact of reported information security incidents on a firm's future performance as demonstrated by changes in trading volume. By exploiting the different perceptions among investors, we form a trading strategy to demonstrate that, on average, one can make about 300% annual profit around the breach announcement day. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","breach announcements; decision tree; information security; sophisticated investors; text mining",""

Our model considers concurrent heterogeneous attacks with distinct characteristics and derives the breach probability functions based on the theory of scale-free networks. The relationships among the major variables, such as network exposure, potential loss due to a security breach, investment effectiveness, and security investment levels, are investigated via analytical and numerical analyses subject to various boundary conditions. In particular, our model shows how a firm should allocate its limited information security budget to defend against two classes of security attacks (targeted and opportunistic) concurrently. Among the results of these analyses, we find that a firm with a limited security budget is better off allocating most or all of the investment to measures against one of the classes of attack. Further, we find that managers should focus the security investment on preventing targeted attacks when the information systems are highly connected and relatively open and when the potential loss is large relative to the security budget. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, efforts are often private and thus both firms and MSSPs can suffer from double moral hazard. Furthermore, the double moral hazard problem in security outsourcing is complicated by the existence of strong externality and the multiclient nature of MSSP services. In this prescriptive research, we first show that the prevailing contract structure in security outsourcing, bilateral refund contract, cannot solve double moral hazard. Adding breach-contingent sunk cost or external payment cannot solve double moral hazard either. Furthermore, positive externality can worsen double moral hazard. We then propose a new contract structure termed multilateral contract and show that it can solve double moral hazard and induce first-best efforts from all contractual parties when an MSSP serves two or more client firms, regardless of the externality. Firm-side externality significantly affects how payments flow under a multilateral contract when a security breach happens. When the number of client firms for an MSSP increases, we show that the contingent payments under multilateral contracts for any security breach scenario can be easily calculated using an additive method, and thus are computationally simple to implement. © 2013 INFORMS.","Double moral hazard; Externality; Information security outsourcing; Managed security service providers","Outsourcing; Risk management; Security of data; Additive methods; Client firms; Contingent payments; Contractual parties; Externality; Managed security service providers; Moral hazard; Security breaches; Economics"

The internal information associated with disclosures may be positive or negative. In this paper, we evaluate how the nature of the disclosed security risk factors, believed to represent the firm's internal information regarding information security, is associated with future breach announcements reported in the media. For this purpose, we build a decision tree model, which classifies the occurrence of future security breaches based on the textual contents of the disclosed security risk factors. The model is able to accurately associate disclosure characteristics with breach announcements about 77% of the time. We further explore the contents of the security risk factors using text-mining techniques to provide a richer interpretation of the results. The results show that the disclosed security risk factors with risk-mitigation themes are less likely to be related to future breach announcements. We also investigate how the market interprets the nature of information security risk factors in annual reports. We find that the market reaction following the security breach announcement is different depending on the nature of the preceding disclosure. Thus, our paper contributes to the literature in information security andsheds light on how market participants can better interpret security risk factors disclosed in financial reports at the time when financial reports are released. © 2013 INFORMS.","Information security; Information security incident; Risk factor; Text mining","Commerce; Decision trees; Security of data; Breach announcements; Decision tree modeling; Information security incidents; Information security risks; Risk factors; Security breach announcements; Text mining; Text mining techniques; Data mining"

The Ministry of Health and Welfare started the project to enhance medical and health technology by collecting, managing, and providing researchers with high-quality human bioresources. The National Biobank of Korea, under the leadership of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, collects specimens through various cohorts and regional biobanks within university hospitals gather specimens from patients. The project began in 2008, and the first phase ended in 2012, which meant that there needed to be a plan for the second phase that begins in 2013. Consequently, professionals from within and outside the project were gathered to develop a plan for the second phase. Under the leadership of the planning committee, six working groups were formed to formulate a practical plan. By conducting two workshops with experts in the six working groups and the planning committee and three forums in 2011 and 2012, they have developed a strategic plan for the second phase of the KBP. This document presents a brief report of the second phase of the project based on a discussion with them.During the first phase of the project (2008-2012), a network was set up between the National Biobank of Korea and 17 biobanks at university-affiliated hospitals in an effort to unify informatics and governance among the participating biobanks. The biobanks within the network manage data on their biospecimens with a unified Biobank Information Management System. Continuous efforts are being made to develop a common standard operating procedure for resource collection, management, distribution, and personal information security, and currently, management of these data is carried out in a somewhat unified manner. In addition, the KBP has trained and educated professionals to work within the biobanks, and has also carried out various publicity promotions to the public and researchers. During the first phase, biospecimens from more than 300,000 participants through various cohorts and biospecimens from more than 200,000 patients from hospitals were collected, which were distributed to approximately 600 research projects.The planning committee for the second phase evaluated that the first phase of the KBP was successful. However, the first phase of the project was meant to allow autonomy to the individual biobanks. The biobanks were able to choose the kind of specimens they were going to collect and the amount of specimen they would set as a goal, as well as being allowed to choose their own methods to manage their biobanks (autonomy). Therefore, some biobanks collected resources that were easy to collect and the resources needed by researchers were not strategically collected. In addition, there was also a low distribution rate to researchers outside of hospitals, who do not have as much access to specimens and cases as those in hospitals. There were also many cases in which researchers were not aware of the KBP, and the distribution processes were not set up to be convenient to the demands of researchers.Accordingly, the second phase of the KBP will be focused on increasing the integration and cooperation between the biobanks within the network. The KBP plans to set goals for the strategic collection of the needed human bioresources. Although the main principle of the first phase was to establish infrastructure and resource collection, the key objective of the second phase is the efficient utilization of gathered resources. In order to fully utilize the gathered resources in an efficient way, distribution systems and policies must be improved. Vitalization of distribution, securing of high-value resource and related clinical and laboratory information, international standardization of resource management systems, and establishment of a virtuous cycle between research and development (R&D) and biobanks are the four main strategies. Based on these strategies, 12 related objectives have been set and are planned to be executed. © 2013 .","Biobank; Biobank network; Biospecimen; Korea Biobank Project; National Biobank of Korea","article; cohort analysis; electronic medical record; geographic distribution; government; health care planning; health care utilization; human; information processing; Korea; Korea Biobank Project; medical informatics; medical information; medical information system; priority journal; public health; public health service; resource management"

The problem is approached statistically, as that of sequential (quickest) changepoint detection. A multi-cyclic setting of quickest change detection is a natural fit for this problem. We propose a novel score-based multi-cyclic detection algorithm. The algorithm is based on the so-called Shiryaev-Roberts procedure. This procedure is as easy to employ in practice and as computationally inexpensive as the popular Cumulative Sum chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average scheme. The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes.

An optimal information management is a critical success factor for the effectiveness, performance and sustainability of ISMS. Information security (IS) has been considered as technical job for a long time. In the last years IS research has developed further an IS governance and people oriented direction. Additionally, different best practices such as control objectives for information and related technology (COBIT) and the information technology infrastructure library (ITIL) have been published. In accordance to the IS approaches the information management for ISMS was studied either only from a technical perspective or a measurement perspective. In this paper we integrate all perspectives by defining a holistic, generic IS management taxonomy. To establish this taxonomy we start from a collaborative ISM framework that considers the different IS research approaches and best practices. Based on our novel IS management taxonomy we define the requirements for information system integration and information processing for a holistic, collaborative IS management. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.","","Data processing; Industrial management; Information technology; Security of data; Taxonomies; Collaborative information; Control objectives for information and related technologies; Critical success factor; Differentiators; Information security management systems; Information system integration; Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL); ISO/IEC; Oriented direction; Research approach; Information management"

After acquiring the user data from this massive information leak, this study has two major research purposes: the paper aims to reveal similarities and differences of password construction among four companies; and investigate how culture factors shape user password construction in China. Design/methodology/approachThis article analyzed real-life passwords collected from four companies by comparing the following attributes: password length, password constitution, top 20 frequent passwords, character frequency distributions, string similarity, and password reuse. FindingsMajor findings include that: general users in China have a weaker sense of security than those in Western countries, which reflected in the password lengths, the character combinations and the content structures; password constitution preferences are different between users in Western countries and in China, where passwords are more similar to the Pinyin context and Chinese number homonym; and password reuse is very common in China. General users tend to reuse the same passwords and IT professionals tend to engage in Seed Password reuse. Research limitations/implicationsDue to the rapid growth of Internet users and e-commerce markets in China, many online service providers may not pay enough attention to security issues, but focus instead on market expansion. Employees in these companies may not be well trained in information security, resulting in carelessness when handling security issues.

Secondly, based on the information provided by the hypersphere centers and the hypersphere radius, the positions of the test samples are confirmed, so that corresponding discrimination rules can be adopted.

However, the flourish of m-Healthcare still faces many challenges including information security and privacy preservation. In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving opportunistic computing framework, called SPOC, for m-Healthcare emergency. With SPOC, smart phone resources including computing power and energy can be opportunistically gathered to process the computing-intensive personal health information (PHI) during m-Healthcare emergency with minimal privacy disclosure. In specific, to leverage the PHI privacy disclosure and the high reliability of PHI process and transmission in m-Healthcare emergency, we introduce an efficient user-centric privacy access control in SPOC framework, which is based on an attribute-based access control and a new privacy-preserving scalar product computation (PPSPC) technique, and allows a medical user to decide who can participate in the opportunistic computing to assist in processing his overwhelming PHI data. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed SPOC framework can efficiently achieve user-centric privacy access control in m-Healthcare emergency. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations demonstrate the SPOC's effectiveness in term of providing high-reliable-PHI process and transmission while minimizing the privacy disclosure during m-Healthcare emergency. © 2013 IEEE.","Mobile-healthcare emergency; opportunistic computing; PPSPC; user-centric privacy access control","Access control; Body sensor networks; Cellular telephone systems; Smartphones; Attribute based access control; Computing frameworks; Computing power; Extensive simulations; Health care providers; Health monitoring; High reliability; Mobile health care; Mobile-healthcare emergency; opportunistic computing; Performance evaluation; Personal health; Pervasive environments; PPSPC; Privacy preserving; Scalar product; Security analysis; Security and privacy; User-centric; Wireless body sensor networks; Health care"

Such environments are prone to externalities, and can cause huge societal losses. We focus on the risks that arise from interdependent reliability failures (faults) and security failures (attacks). We advocate that a sound assessment of these risks requires explicit modeling of the effects of both technology-based defenses and institutions necessary for supporting them. Thus, we consider technology-based security defenses grounded in information security tools and fault-tolerant control in conjunction with institutional structures. Our game-theoretic approach to estimating security risks facilitates more effective defenses, especially against correlated failures. © 2013 IEEE.","","Embedded systems; Game theory; Risk perception; Computational components; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Explicit modeling; Fault tolerant control; Game-theoretic; Institutional structure; Reliability failure; Security defense; Security failure; Security risks; Technology-based; Security of data"

Information security can be viewed as the efficient control of uncertainty arising from malicious acts intended to exploit valuable assets, and in the context of information systems the valuable assets under consideration are data. Data were collected by using an interpretive approach through in-depth interviews and observation within a single case study in Greece. The contribution of this research to interpretive information-systems consists of the study of project commitment and goal theory in an information security-management context, and its grounding within an interpretive epistemology.

It aims to explain the processes that were followed, highlight the problems that were encountered, and show how these were overcome. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a case study approach. The case study emerged from a broader grounded theory study which is outside the scope of this paper. Findings - This paper demonstrates that ISO27001 can be fully integrated into a single management system with ISO9001 and ISO14001, and also illustrates that the various standards can be applied more flexibly than is often thought. Practical implications - This study will be of significant benefit to bereavement professionals because it offers advice and guidance on addressing pitfalls that may be encountered when bereavement services wish to seek certification against international standards. It will also benefit quality, environmental, and information security professionals because it shows, in a practical way, how the three standards can be fully integrated. Originality/value - The integration of ISO27001 into a comprehensive management system is an area which has previously been under-researched. Furthermore, this paper takes an original perspective to information security, arguing that ISO27001 can be applied beyond an ICT environment, and this is demonstrated by considering the standard in the context of bereavement services. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bereavement; Integration; ISO 9000 series; ISO14001; ISO27001; ISO9001; Local authorities; Quality; Quality standards; United Kingdom","Image quality; Integration; Management; Quality control; Research; Security of data; Bereavement; ISO 14001; ISO 9000 series; ISO 9001; ISO27001; Local authorities; Quality standard; United kingdom; Standards"

One of the most promising current biometric techniques is based on the human iris. This paper attempts to detect shape information from the iris by analyzing local intensity variations of an iris image. The methodology involves extraction of iris features using bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and fractal dimension. After the preprocessing procedure, the normalized effective iris image is decomposed into 2D intrinsic mode function (IMF) components at different spatial frequencies by bidimensional empirical mode decomposition. Then the texture features of each intrinsic mode function image are obtained via the differential box-counting method. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, three different similarity measures used in recognition are adopted. The experimental results using the CASIA and ICE iris databases show that the schema presented achieves promising results for iris recognition. Crown Copyright © 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Recently, Chang and Lee proposed a new SSO scheme and claimed its security by providing well-organized security arguments. In this paper, however, we demonstrative that their scheme is actually insecure as it fails to meet credential privacy and soundness of authentication. Specifically, we present two impersonation attacks. The first attack allows a malicious service provider, who has successfully communicated with a legal user twice, to recover the user's credential and then to impersonate the user to access resources and services offered by other service providers. In another attack, an outsider without any credential may be able to enjoy network services freely by impersonating any legal user or a nonexistent user. We identify the flaws in their security arguments to explain why attacks are possible against their SSO scheme. Our attacks also apply to another SSO scheme proposed by Hsu and Chuang, which inspired the design of the Chang-Lee scheme. Moreover, by employing an efficient verifiable encryption of RSA signatures proposed by Ateniese, we propose an improvement for repairing the Chang-Lee scheme.

Modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is usedto convert a primary image into a phase-only mask (POM). The POM isusedas a Fresnel domain key for encrypting an arbitrary data, called random intensity mask (RIM) bonded with a random phase mask. With phase- and amplitude-truncation, asymmetric keys are generated from the RIM. For decryption, the main target is to get the POM, for which the concept of known-plaintext attack has been used. The conventional schemes for attack use known-plaintext for key generation, but in this study it refers to the asymmetric keys. Obtaining Fresnel transform with the same parameters of the POM gives the primary image. We present the computer simulation results of multiple gray-scale images without any cross talk and also for a color image.

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy. This paper is a contribution, from the security point of view, to the assessment of the current situation of a wide class of industrial distributed computing systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper takes into account the process of ensuring a satisfactory degree of security for a distributed industrial system, with respect to some key elements such as the system characteristics, the current state of the art of standardization and the adoption of suitable controls (countermeasures) that can help in lowering the security risks below a predefined, acceptable threshold. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Industrial networks; information security; network security; risk assessment; security analysis and monitoring; security countermeasures","Distributed parameter networks; Industry; Information technology; Risk assessment; Security of data; Classical approach; Current situation; Cyber threats; Distributed computing systems; Distributed information; Industrial computers; Industrial networks; Industrial systems; Key elements; Physical systems; Satisfactory degree; Security analysis; Security countermeasures; Security issues; Security point; Security risks; State of the art; System characteristics; Network security"

At the same time, existing technology is not being fully utilized because of non-technological issues that pertain to economics and the human dimension. Issues related to how insiders actually behave are critical to ensuring that the best technologies are meeting their intended purpose. In our research, we have investigated accepted models of perceptions of risk and characteristics unique to insider threat, and we have introduced ordinal scales to these models to measure insider perceptions of risk. We have also investigated decision theories, leading to a conclusion that prospect theory, developed by Tversky and Kahneman, may be used to describe the risk-taking behavior of insiders and can be accommodated in our model. Our results indicate that there is an inverse relationship between perceived risk and benefit by insiders and that their behavior cannot be explained well by the models that are based on the traditional methods of engineering risk analysis and expected utility. We discuss the results of validating that model with forty-two senior information security executives from a variety of organizations. We also discuss how the model may be used to identify characteristics of insiders' perceptions of risk and benefit, their risk-taking behavior and how to frame insider decisions. Finally, we recommend understanding risk of detection and creating a fair working environment to reduce the likelihood of committing criminal acts by insiders. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Behavior; Insider; Perception; Prospect theory; Risk","Models; Risk analysis; Risks; Security of data; Sensory perception; Behavior; Engineering risk analysis; Insider; Inverse relationship; Perceptions of risks; Prospect theory; Risk-taking behaviors; Working environment; Risk perception"

Despite government efforts to limit the flow of online news, Chinese Internet users are able to access unprecedented amounts of information, and political activists have utilized the Web as a vital communications tool. In recent years, Twitter-like microblogging has surged, resulting in dramatic cases of dissident communication and public comment on sensitive political issues. However, the Web has proven to be less of a democratic catalyst in China than many observers had hoped. The PRC government has one of the most rigorous Internet censorship systems, which relies heavily upon cooperation between the government and private Internet companies. Some U.S. policy makers have been especially critical of the compliance of some U.S. Internet communications and technology (ICT) companies with China's censorship and policing activities. The development of the Internet and its use in China have raised U.S. congressional concerns, including those related to human rights, trade and investment, and cybersecurity. The link between the Internet and human rights, a pillar of U.S. foreign policy towards China, is the main focus of this report. Congressional interest in the Internet in China is tied to human rights concerns in a number of ways. These include the following: • The use of the Internet as a U.S. policy tool for promoting freedom of expression and other rights in China, • The use of the Internet by political dissidents in the PRC, and the political repression that such use often provokes, • The role of U.S. Internet companies in both spreading freedom in China and complying with PRC censorship and social control efforts, and • The development of U.S. Internet freedom policies globally. Since 2006, congressional committees and commissions have held nine hearings on Internet freedom and related issues, with a large emphasis on China. In response to criticism, in 2008, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google, and other parties founded the Global Network Initiative, a set of guidelines that promotes awareness, due diligence, and transparency regarding the activities of ICT companies and their impacts on human rights, particularly in countries where governments frequently violate the rights of Internet users to freedom of expression and privacy. In the 112th Congress, the Global Online Freedom Act (H.R. 3605) would require U.S. companies to disclose any censorship or surveillance technology that they provide to Internet-restricting countries. It also would bar U.S. companies from selling technology that could be used for the purposes of censorship or surveillance in such countries. For over a decade, the United States government has sought to promote global Internet freedom, particularly in China and Iran. In 2006, the Bush Administration established the Global Internet Freedom Task Force, which was renamed the NetFreedom Task Force under the Obama Administration. Congress provided $95 million for global Internet freedom programs between 2008 and 2012. The Broadcasting Board of Governors has spent approximately $2 million annually during the past decade to help enable Internet users in China and other Internetrestricting countries to access its websites, such as Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Some experts argue that support for counter-censorship technology, which has long dominated the U.S. effort to promote global Internet freedom, has had an important but limited impact. Obstacles to Internet freedom in China and elsewhere include not only censorship but also the following: advances in government capabilities to monitor and attack online dissident activity; tight restrictions on social networking; and the lack of popular pressure for greater Internet freedom. As part of a broadening policy approach, the U.S. government has sponsored a widening range of Internet freedom programs, including censorship circumvention technology; privacy protection and online security; training civil society groups in effective uses of the Web for communications, organizational, and advocacy purposes; and spreading awareness of Internet freedom. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

While an efficient and fundamentally safe means of transport, this network is vulnerable to cyber attacks. In particular, cyber infiltration of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems could allow successful ""hackers"" to disrupt pipeline service and cause spills, explosions, or fires-all from remote locations. In March 2012, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported ongoing cyber intrusions among U.S. natural gas pipeline operators. These intrusions have heightened congressional concern about cybersecurity in the U.S. pipelines sector. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is authorized by federal statute to promulgate pipeline physical security and cybersecurity regulations, if necessary, but the agency has not issued such regulations. TSA officials assert that security regulations could be counterproductive because they could establish a general standard below the level of security already in place for many pipelines. An April 2011 White House proposal and the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 (S. 2105) both would mandate cybersecurity regulations for privately owned critical infrastructures sectors like pipelines. A revised version of S. 2105, S. 3414, would permit the issuance of regulations but would focus on voluntary cybersecurity measures. While the pipelines sector has many cybersecurity issues in common with other critical infrastructure sectors, it is somewhat distinct in several ways: • Pipelines in the United States have been the target of several confirmed terrorist plots and attempted physical attacks since September 11, 2001. • Changes to pipeline computer networks over the past 20 years, more sophisticated hackers, and the emergence of specialized malicious software have made pipeline SCADA operations increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks. • There recently has been a coordinated series of cyber intrusions specifically targeting U.S. pipeline computer systems. • TSA already has statutory authority to issue cybersecurity regulations for pipelines if the agency chooses to do so, but it may not have the resources to develop, implement, and enforce such regulations if they are mandated. TSA maintains that voluntary standards have been effective in protecting U.S. pipelines from cyber attacks. Based on the agenc's corporate security reviews, TSA believes cybersecurity among major U.S. pipeline systems is effective. However, without formal cybersecurity plans and reporting requirements, it is difficult for Congress to know for certain. Whether the self-interest of pipeline operators is sufficient to generate the level of cybersecurity appropriate for a critical infrastructure sector is open to debate. If Congress concludes that current voluntary measures are insufficient to ensure pipeline cybersecurity, it may decide to provide specific direction to the TSA to develop regulations and provide additional resources to support them, as such an effort may be beyond the TSA Pipeline Security Division's existing capabilities. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We introduce a novel embedding approach called representation permutation to embed messages in the representation domain. The proposed approach embeds messages by permuting/rearranging vertex representation orders, triangle representation orders, and connectivity information. In contrast to the general data hiding schemes that embed messages by slightly modifying the appearance of cover media, the proposed approach will not degrade any perceptual quality of the cover model, that is, without visual distortion. In addition, the proposed approach can hide (∂p +βp) nv bits on a polygon model (nv represents the number of vertices, and the variables ∂p and βp are greater than 2.1 and 3.7, respectively). Furthermore, the proposed approach can easily combine with other spatial-based and spectral-based information hiding schemes to provide additional hiding capacity. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is efficient and can provide greater hiding capacity than recent techniques, while complying with the basic security requirement for steganography. © 2013 ICIC International.","Information hiding; Information security; Representation domain; Steganography","Algorithms; Contrast media; Security of data; Steganography; Three dimensional; Connectivity information; Data hiding; Distortion-free; Hiding capacity; High-capacity; Information hiding; Perceptual quality; Polygon-models; Representation domain; Security requirements; Visual distortion; Three dimensional computer graphics"

However, various levels of uncertainties exist in consumer knowledge and evaluation of online phishing risks. Drawing upon research in decision under risks and uncertainties, this study categorizes an online consumer's knowledge of phishing risks as falling under one of four uncertainty states: known certainty, known uncertainty, unknown uncertainty, and unknowable uncertainty. This research focuses on the effect of uncertainty levels of e-commerce consumers' knowledge of phishing risks on their online purchase intentions and decision. A series of four group experiments were conducted with the four uncertainty knowledge states as treatments among 120 subjects. The experimental results indicate that consumer willingness to pay to avoid risks and their intention to purchase online vary systematically under different uncertainty levels of knowledge of phishing risks. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","","Electrical engineering; Electronic commerce; Intelligent systems; Security of data; Consumer knowledge; Decision under uncertainty; Four-group; Knowledge state; Online consumers; Phishing; Purchase intention; Risks and uncertainties; Unknown uncertainty; Willingness to pay; Computer crime"

These benefits range from obvious cost reductions brought about by the elimination of wiring to better plant productivity, improved asset management, and strong data reporting. The success achieved while complying with the DoD's restrictive security requirements demonstrates that secure wireless technology can be adopted by operators of critical systems looking to implement more robust, secure, reliable, cost-effective systems. In the absence of any commercial or federal cybersecurity standards or requirements, the industrial sector has looked to the military for an example of best practices and security requirements. Although integrated networks provide undeniable benefits, some critical infrastructure operators are still in denial about cyber threats targeting, disrupting and/or damaging industrial control systems. Recent threats such as Stuxnet and Flame have powerfully demonstrated that once-theoretical threats have now become a reality; cyber attacks that threaten to penetrate and sabotage critical control and monitoring systems continue to generate serious consequences. Many of these threats can be effectively countered and defended against with changes to key security processes and organization. Cyber warfare is not just a threat for the future - it is a very real threat today, forcing an increased need for robust security to ensure the continued operation and protection of critical control and monitoring systems worldwide. The time to future-proof plant control systems is now, and the DoD approaches described in this article should pave the way for broader industrial adoption of secure wireless networks.","",""

In order to rapidly charge the high correlation among pixels of image, the study proposed a new image permutation approach using combinational chaotic maps. The new chaotic map was realized by processing image stretch and fold. Firstly, a square image was divided into two isosceles triangles along the diagonal direction. Utilizing the difference of the pixel numbers of adj acent columns, each pixel in a column was inserted to the corresponding adj acent column. Then, the plain image could be stretched to a line. Finally, the line was folded over to the cipher image. Utilizing two different methods of fold, the study designed four maps for permutation. A new permutation approach was developed which used a six decimal numbers as the keys. The deciphering process was an invertible process using the same keys. The simulation results showed the speed of permutation is fast and high correlation among adjacent pixels was rapidly charged. And the encryption could satisfy the high security requirements or as a part of the other encryption. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Baker map; Chaotic map; Image encryption; Image permutation; Information security","Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Image processing; Lyapunov methods; Security of data; Adjacent pixels; Chaotic map; Image encryptions; Image permutation; Image security; Permutation approach; Security requirements; Pixels"

This task can be crucial when images are used as evidence to influence or decide judgment such as in a court of law. Aiming at copy-move forgery, which is the most popular tampering method, many detecting methods have been proposed by researchers all over the world. But these methods seldom take the new compression standard-JPEG 2000 into account, which will be more and more popular. Based on this, a robust detecting method based on ridgelet transform is proposed in this paper. The method is according to the fact that ridgelet transform applies wavelet transform on the slices gained from Radon transform. Copy-move forgery detecting methods using Radon transform have already been proposed and proved to be robust to some kinds of attacks except JPEG 2000. The experiments done with eleven types of digital images show that the proposed method is a robust to attackes, such as rotation, JPEG compression, adding noise. Especially, the method is robust to the new compression standard of JPEG 2000.","Image forensics; JPEG 2000 compression; JPEG compression; Ridgelet transform","Intelligent networks; Mathematical transformations; Security of data; Compression standards; Copy-move forgeries; Detecting methods; Digital image forensics; Image forensics; JPEG 2000; JPEG compression; Ridgelet transforms; Image compression"

However, there are still several issues regarding large-scale deployment of biometrics in realworld situations that need to be resolved before biometrics can be incorporated together. One of these issues is the occurrence of high training time while enrolling a large amount of people into the system. Hence, in this chapter, the authors present the training architecture for an audio visual system for large scale people recognition over internet protocol. In the proposed architecture, a selection criteria divider unit is used to decompose the large scale people or population into smaller groups whereby each group is trained subsequently. As the input dimensions of each group is reduced compared to the original data size, the proposed structure greatly reduces the overall training time required. To combine the scores from all groups, a two-level fusion based on weighted sum rule and max rule is also proposed in this chapter. The implementation results of the proposed system show a great reduction in training time compared to a similar system trained by conventional means without any compromise on the performance of the system. In addition to the proposal of a scalable training architecture for large-scale people recognition based on audio visual data, a literature review of available audio visual speaker recognition systems and large-scale population training architectures are also presented in this chapter. © 2013 by IGI Global.

In the late 1990s, Korea put much effort into development of broadband networks, starting from a master plan in 1995. Korea became a world leader with widely available wired and wireless broadband networks. Korea also led in Internet applications including online games, search engines and social networking services. As one of the earlier Internet countries, Korea has been vulnerable to newly arising problems on the Internet such as cybersecurity, net abuse and game addiction. Korea has been trying to solve these problems in collaboration with other leading countries.

Pervasive communication and computer systems intend to provide access to information and services anytime and anywhere, demanding cryptographic systems more practical and that consider the characteristics of emerging network paradigms, such as wireless communication, device constraints and mobility. Identity- Based Cryptography (IBC) is an asymmetric key cryptographic technology that employs as user's public key any unique information related to the identity of the user. IBC efficiently manages keying material and provides an easy way to issue a pair of keys applying user information. However, it assumes the existence of a Trusted Third Party (TTP), called Private Key Generator (PKG), which is responsible for generating the corresponding user private key. Relying on a TTP and using an identity as the base of the scheme result in different weaknesses on the system, as the inherent key escrow problem. This chapter investigates those weaknesses, and it points out the stat-of-the-art of proposed solutions to avoid them. This chapter also provides an overview of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE), Identity-Based Signature (IBS) and Identity-Based Key Agreement (IBKA), emphasizing IBE due to being an open problem for many years.

Measurement: We utilized the results from the Kroll/Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society telephone-based survey of 250 US healthcare organizations including adoption status of security practices, breach incidents, and perceived compliance levels on Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Red Flags rules, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state laws governing patient information security. Results: Our analysis identified three clusters (which we call leaders, followers, and laggers) based on the variance of security practice patterns. The clusters have significant differences among non-technical practices rather than technical practices, and the highest level of compliance was associated with hospitals that employed a balanced approach between technical and non-technical practices (or between one-off and cultural practices). Conclusions: Hospitals in the highest level of compliance were significantly managing third parties' breaches and training. Audit practices were important to those who scored in the middle of the pack on compliance. Our results provide security practice benchmarks for healthcare administrators and can help policy makers in developing strategic and practical guidelines for practice adoption.","","American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; Cluster Analysis; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Discriminant Analysis; Guideline Adherence; Health Care Surveys; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; Humans; Medical Informatics; United States; adoption; article; computer security; health care industry; health care organization; health care policy; health survey; medical information system; telephone"

Conventional optical image encryption systems can securely transmit valuable images using an encryption method for possible application in optical transmission systems. The steganographic optical image encryption system based on the DRPE technique has been investigated to hide secret data in encrypted images. However, the DRPE techniques vulnerable to attacks and many of the data hiding methods in the DRPE system can distort the decrypted images. The proposed system, based on reversible data hiding, uses a JBIG2 compression scheme to achieve lossless decrypted image quality and perform a prior encryption process. Thus, the DRPE technique enables a more secured optical encryption process. The proposed method extracts and compresses the bit planes of the original image using the lossless JBIG2 technique. The secret data are embedded in the remaining storage space. The RSA algorithm can cipher the compressed binary bits and secret data for advanced security. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves a high data embedding capacity and lossless reconstruction of the original images. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Double random phase encoding; Information security; Optical encryption; Reversible data embedding; Steganography","Cryptography; Digital storage; Encoding (symbols); Geometrical optics; Image processing; Light transmission; Mobile security; Optical data processing; Steganography; Data embedding capacity; Double random-phase encoding; Lossless reconstruction; Optical encryption; Optical image encryption; Optical transmission systems; Reversible data embedding; Reversible data hiding; Security of data"

Thus legal compliance, commercial image and competitive edge are sustainable maintained. Due to increasingly faster changing information security (IS) requirements (from market, customer, technology, law or regulations) the effectiveness and performance of the ISMS must be continually evaluated and improved. Data must be recorded, analyzed and if necessary appropriate corrective or preventive actions should be taken. For these measurement and improvement tasks we have to assign roles and responsibilities. Firstly we define different roles and their tasks for information security (IS) measurement and improvement. Starting from the approved organizational structure we assign the responsibilities for these roles to top and executive management. After we elaborate and document all relevant business processes with their supporting IT services and go on through all technical layers describing the relevant items with their dependencies and relationships. To entire processes, services and items are assigned responsibilities for the defined roles systematically, consistently and traceably.

Therefore, insuring the information system continuously and correctly working has become an urgent problem in the information security field. And continuous data protection (CDP) supporting service recovery provides us a good idea to resolve it. In this article, we have designed and implemented a continuous data protection system supporting service recovery, which is named SSR-CDPS. The basic design idea of the SSR-CDPS architecture is dividing the whole protection process into three stages: monitoring, protecting and recovery. Meanwhile, we propose a multi versioning data backup mechanism for the protecting process and a novel file failure recovery mechanism. Especially, we transfer the full copy operation of file contents into the merely slight modification operation on the FAT table, MFT table or other similar data structures; so that we achieve the aim of greatly reducing the direct disks read and write overhead. The test toward the SSR-CDPS prototype system shows that the system can significantly improve the efficiency of data protection within limited change to the existing file system; thus, it can meet the high real-time and the continuity requirements of the information system recovery applications. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Continuous data protection (CDP); Monitoring; Protecting; Recovery; Service recovery","Data structures; Information systems; Manufacture; Monitoring; Security of data; Continuity requirements; Continuous data protections; Data backups; Data protection; Design ideas; Failure recovery mechanism; File contents; File systems; Multi-versioning; Network environments; Protecting; Prototype system; Urgent problems; Recovery"

Managing multiple private/public keys is a heavy burden to a user due to key management and storage. The recent advancement of identity-based cryptography allow a single private key to map multiple public keys (identities); therefore the private key management is simplified. Unfortunately, the existing schemes capturing this feature do not allow dynamic changes of identities and have a large data size proportional to the number of the associated identities. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we present an efficient and dynamic identity-based key exchange protocol and prove its security under the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model.

The use of social media and collaboration directly with users could permit a new paradigm in the way the public services are used by the public, allowing users to add and manipulate data and even applications that will use the data.

Self-adaptive security is an applicable solution for this challenge. This paper presents an architectural approach for security adaptation in smart spaces. The approach combines an adaptation loop, Information Security Measuring Ontology (ISMO) and a smart space security-control model. The adaptation loop includes phases to monitor, analyze, plan and execute changes in the smart space. The ISMO offers input knowledge for the adaptation loop and the security-control model enforces dynamic access control policies. The approach is novel because it defines the whole adaptation loop and knowledge required in each phase of the adaptation. The contributions are validated as a part of the smart space pilot implementation. The approach offers reusable and extensible means to achieve adaptive security in smart spaces and up-to-date access control for devices that appear in the space. Hence, the approach supports the work of smart space application developers. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Architecture; Authentication; Authorization; Ontology; Self-adaptation",""

These benefits range from obvious cost reductions brought about by the elimination of wiring to better plant productivity, improved asset management, and strong data reporting. The success achieved while complying with the DoD's restrictive security requirements demonstrates that secure wireless technology can be adopted by operators of critical systems looking to implement more robust, secure, reliable, cost-effective systems. In the absence of any commercial or federal cybersecurity standards or requirements, the industrial sector has looked to the military for an example of best practices and security requirements. Although integrated networks provide undeniable benefits, some critical infrastructure operators are still in denial about cyber threats targeting, disrupting and/or damaging industrial control systems. Recent threats such as Stuxnet and Flame have powerfully demonstrated that once-theoretical threats have now become a reality; cyber attacks that threaten to penetrate and sabotage critical control and monitoring systems continue to generate serious consequences. Many of these threats can be effectively countered and defended against with changes to key security processes and organization. Cyber warfare is not just a threat for the future - it is a very real threat today, forcing an increased need for robust security to ensure the continued operation and protection of critical control and monitoring systems worldwide. The time to future-proof plant control systems is now, and the DoD approaches described in this article should pave the way for broader industrial adoption of secure wireless networks. © 1995-2012 All rights reserved.","",""

As a widely adopted solution to carry a principal's identity and attributes of different organizations, the credential-based trust establishment has become popular over Internet. In this paper, we propose a hybrid negotiation tree based modeling approach, named HiTrust, to build cross-organizational trust relationship. The HiTrust is used to characterize the gradual interactions state during the trust establishment between the principals from different security organizations. Compared with the original disclosure tree model, the hybrid tree model in HiTrust can embed both policies and credential sets in a tree node, and is able to describe fine-grained security policy with attributes or negotiation context information. This property endows the HiTrust with the capability of describing complex trust establishment requirements, and makes it more efficient to search desired tree node. Furthermore, to enhance the usability and efficiency of negotiation service, we propose a session state maintenance mechanism based on a policy stack and an asynchronous trust chain propagation mechanism.

Manufacturing message specification (MMS), sample measured value (SMV) and generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE), are common messages used in smart substations, whether these messages can be transmitted secretly is extremely important for the security of entire substation system. If each message uses a mode of authentication encryption algorithm, that may increase the burden of network equipments and affect their inter-operability. A message security mechanism and the message format for the secure transmission of smart substation messages based on GCM (Galois/counter mode) are designed. Taking GOOSE message as an example, the secure message transmission algorithm design, and its time cost based on GCM are analyzed. Finally, advantage analysis of secure message transmission method based on GCM for smart substation is carried. With the analysis, it is concluded that the common message authentication encryption algorithm based on GCM is adopted for different security requirements of messages and secure transmission of different messages is achieved through choosing different algorithm modes. That can improve security of smart substation information and network performance. © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.","Authentication encryption; IEC 61850; Secure message transmission; Smart substation","Algorithms; Cryptography; Electric substations; Network performance; Security of data; Standards; Advantage analysis; Algorithm design; Authentication encryption; Common messages; Generic object oriented sub-station events; GOOSE messages; IEC 61850; Iec 61850 standards; Manufacturing message specification; Measured values; Message format; Message securities; Network equipment; Secure message transmission; Secure transmission; Security requirements; Smart substations; Substation system; Time cost; Authentication"

This paper proposes a secure satellite image encryption technique based on chaotic and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) techniques to protect critical and confidential satellite imagery. Arnold's cat map is used to shuffle the pixel values. A chaotic Henon map is used to generate a random sequence for the AES algorithm, and the shuffled-image is encrypted using the AES algorithm. The security and performance is acceptable to deal with high resolution and multi-spectral satellite imagery. The experimental results are shown, along with those for some traditional encryption techniques, for a comparison and evaluation. Detailed experimental results are also given of the security, statistical, and performance analyses of the complete implementation of the new proposed solution.

This would result in that origins of different sections within an information resource are different. Users cannot trace the path of the information resource's propagation, so they are unable to determine its reliability. To resolve this security problem, a new concept ""Information Resource View"" is proposed which uses ""File View"" as reference. Each information resource is divided into logical blocks. Several logical blocks are combined as one view through the multi-layers mapping mechanism. In order to provide the operation interface to manipulate information resource views, this paper proposes nine kinds of algebra operations using the relation algebra operations of database as reference. There are four kinds of relation algebra operations of database which are taken as basic operations, they are union, selection, difference and rename. Then, this paper defines information resource life-cycles as two main phases: creating the information resource view and accessing the content of it. Finally, according the requirements of these two phases, it defines other five kinds of relation algebra operations: normalization, citation, projection, instantiation and access. © 2013 Binary Information Press.","Algebra operation; File view; Information resource view; Information security","Algebra; Security of data; File view; Information resource; Information resource views; Internet environment; Mapping mechanism; Operation interface; Relation algebras; Security problems; Information science"

In this study we examine the influence of interactivity, as well as static and interactive fear appeals, on motivating users to increase the strength of their passwords. We developed a field experiment involving the account registration process of a website in use in which we observed the strength of passwords chosen by users. Data were collected from 354 users in 65 countries.

The method uses the interval time of network packets to transfer information, the sender codes covert information using hash spreading spectrum, and the receiver forecasts the channel noise and eliminates it. In order to solve the contradictory relationship between transmission rate and robustness, the strategy of maximizing robustness under fixed transmission rate is proposed. The experimental environment of this covert channel is constructed and several experiments are conducted. The results show that the ability to resist noise is increased about by 20%, compared with other methods on the same problem.","Channel robustness; Channel transmission rate; Information security; Network covert timing channel","Electrical engineering; Signal processing; Channel robustness; Channel transmission; Covert channels; Covert timing channels; Experimental environment; Network packets; Transfer information; Transmission rates; Security of data"

Also, the chaotic signal is very sensitive to the initial conditions. So, if you do not know the initial conditions. In noise and interference environment, we will evaluate performance of different chaotic maps in the CDSK chaotic modulation system. Also, we analyze BER performance depending on the selection of spreading factor. We like to propose the selection condition of spreading factor to maximize BER performance. For this analysis, we were used Tent map, logistic map, henon map, Bernoulli shift map. Through the theoretical analysis and computer simulations, it is confirmed that henon map is better than the other three chaotic maps.

We propose a moving target defense concept in which the means of detection is set in motion. This is done by moving away from static signature-based detection and instead adopting biological modeling techniques that describe families of related sequences. We present here one example for how to apply evolutionary models to cyber sequences, and demonstrate the feasibility of this technique on analysis of a complex, evolving software project. Specifically, we applied sequence-based and profile-based evolutionary models and report the ability of these models to recognize highly volatile code regions. We found that different drift models reliably identify different types of evolutionarily related code regions. The impact is that these (and possibly other) evolutionary models could be used in a moving target defense in which the ""signature"" being used to detect sequence-based behaviors is not a fixed signature but one that can recognize new variants of a known family based on multiple evolutionary models.

Given a set of potential threats and a set of available countermeasures, the decision maker needs to decide which countermeasure to implement under limited budget to minimize potential losses from successful cyber-attacks and mitigate the impact of disruptions caused by IT security incidents. The selection of countermeasures is based on their effectiveness of blocking different threats, implementation costs and probability of potential attack scenarios. The problem is formulated as a single- or bi-objective mixed integer program and a conditional value-at-risk approach combined with scenario-based analysis is applied to control the risk of high losses due to operational disruptions and optimize worst-case performance of an IT system. The bi-objective trade-off model provides the decision maker with a simple tool for balancing expected and worst-case losses and for shaping of the resulting cost distribution through the selection of optimal subset of countermeasures for implementation, i.e., the selection of optimal countermeasure portfolio. The selected portfolio explicitly depends on preferred confidence level and cost/risk preference of the decision maker. Numerical examples are presented and some computational results are reported to compare the risk-averse solutions that minimize conditional value-at-risk with the risk-neutral ones that minimize expected cost. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this method, the color image is split into three-color channels: red, green, blue. Each color channel bonded to a random phase mask and a random phase key code are gyrator transformed separately. The two obtained information multiplexed to form a joint gyrator power spectrum, which is again gyrator transformed to get a joint-extended gyrator power spectrum. The same phase key code is used in both the data encryption and decryption. The three-color channels are independently encrypted and decrypted to avoid the interference of crosstalks. The decrypted image is obtained without any noise and distortion. The angle parameters of gyrator transform in each channel are additional encryption keys for enhancing the security. The proposed system has resistant against chosen- and known plaintext attacks. The calculated values of mean square error and peak signal-to-noise ratio support the noise-free recovery of original color image. The implementation of opto-electronic setup has been proposed.

Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, we examine the relationship between the personality traits of conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness with attitudes and intentions towards managing technical security measures. The highly relevant moderating role of compliance factors is also investigated. The hypothesized relationships are analyzed and validated using empirical data from a survey of 174 information security executives. Findings suggest that conscientiousness is important in determining the attitude towards the management of technical security measures. In addition, the findings indicate that when executives are confronted with information security standards or guidelines, the personality traits of conscientiousness and openness will have a stronger effect on attitude towards managing security measures than without moderators. © 2012 IEEE.","","Systems science; Behavioral intention; Cognitive factors; Empirical examination; Information assets; Personality traits; Security measure; Technical security; Theory of Planned Behavior; Security of data"

This study draws on socio-cognitive concept of frames and on literature on information security policies to suggest a theoretical and analytical concept of Information Security Policy Frames of Reference (ISPFOR). The concept provides a sensitizing device to interpret how the frames influence organizational groups' perceptions of policies and the implications of the perceptions on policy outcomes.

Federations of semantic information services, combining service-orientation and semantic technologies, provide a promising solution for this problem. However, without proper measures to establish information security, companies will be reluctant to join an information federation, which could lead to serious adoption barriers. Following the design science paradigm, this paper presents general objectives and a process for designing a secure federation of semantic information services.

An equivalent circuit model of a cryptographic FPGA in which an advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm had been implemented was determined from experimental measurements under the initial configuration of a power distribution network (PDN) of the FPGA. The model was implemented into a commercial analog circuit simulator, and power traces due to the simultaneous switching noise current were estimated under three different PDN configurations in which a decoupling circuit was inserted into the PDN as an on-board countermeasure. Estimated power traces were analyzed statistically by the correlation power analysis method to obtain correlation values, a major security index of AES. Variation of the correlation values with changes in decoupling configuration agreed with the corresponding experimental results.

While the use of Chaotic maps can enhance security, it is seen that the overall BER performance gets degraded when compared to conventional communication schemes.

Three were found to emit clear ultrahigh frequency radio signals visually related to the displayed image, from the display controller or its low-voltage differential signaling link to the LCD panel. Although the input signals to all four products followed the same TV standard, the timing parameters of their emanations differed substantially. Some also frequency-modulate their pixel clock to improve compliance with electromagnetic-interference limits. All digitally rescale the input image to the respective display size. The frame rate at which the display panel is driven is, if at all, only loosely phase locked to the input signal.

Purpose of this study is to propose an appropriate model for securing information across the supply chain. Reviewing the related literature, investigating the latest information technology and conducting interview with IT and SCM professionals expose the best technique of information security among supply partners. Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) solution is proposed as the best method for securing information across the supply chain partners. The findings highlight the effective method of information security at the both level of network interconnections and software applications. This study would give invaluable information to all researchers and practitioner who investigate the information security among supply chain partners. © 2013 Science Publication.","Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS); Information sharing; SCM; Security",""

Few applications like medical image security and satellite image security needs to secure only selected portion of the image. This paper describes a concept of selective image encryption in two ways. First method divides the image in to sub blocks, then selected blocks are applied to encryption process. Second method automatically detects the positions of objects, and then selected objects are applied to encryption process. Morphological techniques are used to detect the positions of the objects in given images. These two approaches are specifically developed to encrypt the portion of an image in medical images and satellite image.","Partial image encryption; Region of interest; Visible encryption",""

The successful employment of these embedded systems for e-commerce, transaction banking, mobile commerce, etc, depend on the reliability of the security solutions. Respecting the real-time performance and the resource-constrained target environment for the next-generation applications, the embedded system design have been a theme of serious study these last few years. This paper presents a hardware crypto-processor for the arising issue of information security in embedded system. This crypto-processor can be used for various security applications such as smartcards, network routers, wireless systems, etc. The proposed 32-bit processor executes various IP crypto cores like hash function, private and public key operations, Random Number generator and other application programs such as user authentication. The hardware description is done in ModelSim using VHDL and synthesized using Synopsys Design Compiler. Furthermore, the proposed crypto-processor is implemented using Xilinx XC5VFX70t FPGA device and an ASIC CMOS 40 nm technology. The results show a high performance, confirming the efficiency of the processor. We have carefully chosen the dedicated algorithms to reduce the required memory resources while respecting the necessary runtime within reasonable limits. The proposed crypto-processor has a total core area of 1.35 mm2 and can achieve an operating system frequency of 500 MHz. The estimated power of the chip was 4,6 mW at 10 MHz. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","AES; ASIC and FPGA implementation; Cryptographic processor; ECDSA; Embedded system; Low-resource constraints",""

For each of the governance domains, they propose a main decision type, using the taxonomy of information technology decisions defined by Weill and Ross (2004). This framework recommends the selection of decision rights allocation patterns that are proper to those decision types to ensure good security decisions.

Unique paths through causal event graphs are used to model deterministic signatures which can be used by an intrusion detection system to classify events. A case study is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for classifying cyber and physical events in an electric transmission system. Bulk electric transmission systems are dynamic cyber-physical systems. Cyber monitoring and control systems are used to remotely operate the power system and to detect and react to physical disturbances. The communication layer associated with this monitoring and control functionality also enables cyber attacks against transmission systems. Existing regulations require utilities to use monitoring techniques such as intrusion detection systems to monitor cyber activity at electronic security perimeter boundaries. Recent attacks demonstrate that monitoring restricted to boundaries is insufficient to detect all attack threats. The methodology described in this paper provides a means to develop a model based defense in depth solution for electric transmission system intrusion detection.

This is particularly true of cybersecurity problems, which are typically discovered after a system has been put into operation. By addressing cybersecurity in a system's requirements - at the beginning of the system lifecycle - the total cost of the system can be substantially reduced.

With 581 responses collected through a survey of IT users in South Korea, the results strongly support the fundamental proposition that the information security climate has significant positive influence on the intention of the security policy compliance. The study also reveals that the security climate nurtures the employee's organizational commitment, which in turn shapes favorable attitude towards the compliance of information security and controls the perceived cost of security compliance at the same time.

Although psychosocial risks at the workplace have been extensively researched from a managerial point of view, their effect on IS has not been formally studied to the extent required by the gravity of the topic. Design/methodology/approach - Based on existing research on psychosocial risks, their potential effects on IS are examined. Findings - It is shown that as psychosocial risks affect people at the workplace, they diminish their ability to defend IS. Research limitations/implications - Psychosocial risks are identified as a factor in IS breakdown. Future research should be directed towards assessing the significance of the effects of various psychosocial risks on IS, creating an assessment methodology for the resulting IS posture of the organisation and devising mitigation methodologies. Practical implications - The proposed approach will provide a significant part of the answer to the question of why IS fails when all prescribed measures and controls are in place and active. More effective controls for psychosocial risks at the workplace can be created as the incentive of upholding IS will be added to the equation of their mitigation. Social implications - The organisational environment in which human beings are called upon to function in a secure manner will be redefined, along with what constitutes a 'reasonable request' from human operators in the context of IS. Originality/value - Bringing together psychosocial risks and IS in research will provide a better understanding of the shortcomings of human nature with respect to IS. Organisations and employees will benefit from the resulting psychosocial risk mitigation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer security; Data security; Employees behaviour; Human aspects; Information security; Information systems; Psychosocial risks","Behavioral research; Information systems; Research; Security of data; Assessment methodologies; Design/methodology/approach; Employees behaviours; Human aspects; Human operator; Potential effects; Risk mitigation; Social implication; Occupational risks"

Although technical and procedural measures help improve information security, there is an increased need to accommodate human, social and organizational factors. Despite the plethora of studies that attempt to identify the factors that motivate compliance behavior or discourage abuse and misuse behaviors, there is a lack of studies that investigate the role of ethical ideology per se in explaining compliance behavior. The purpose of this research is to investigate the role of ethics in explaining Information Security Policy (ISP) compliance. In that regard, a model that integrates behavioral and ethical theoretical perspectives is developed and tested.

Each node will act as a router to maintain network operation. There is no central node for controlling entire network. So routing in MANET is very important. In content based routing, data is transferred from source node to requested nodes is not based on destinations addresses. Therefore it is very flexible and reliable, because source node does not need to know destination nodes. As some standard content based routing protocols, when a node publishes its content, It will broadcast data to network. The published content will be cached at all routes on the network. So when a node publish a request to get some content, it will prepare a subscription message then broadcast it to network. When any node on network received that subscription, it matches subscriptions content with published content that have been cached on it. If found then matched content will be transferred to requested node. There is another routing model when nodes have content requests, they broadcast subscription messages to network. When nodes receive subscriptions, they cache these messages. When a node publish its content by broadcast protocol, any node receives that content, it will match received content with subscriptions cached on it to find all nodes have requested that content, then forwarding that content to these nodes. Service Oriented Routing is inherited from the model of content based routing (CBR) [3, 4], combined with several advanced techniques such as Multicast increase the data rate [6], and data encryption to ensure information security. This article presents some techniques to support multicast packet forwarding from one network node to a set of nodes with guaranteed quality of service. By using these techniques can decrease network load, congestion, use network resources efficiently. © 2013 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Ad hoc network; bandwidth guarantee; content; MANET; QoS; routing; service; time slot assignment","Ad hoc networks; Broadcasting; Distributed computer systems; Multicasting; Network routing; Publishing; Quality of service; Routers; Security of data; Bandwidth guarantee; content; MANET; routing; service; Time slot assignment; Mobile ad hoc networks"

As the meters multiply, so do issues concerning the privacy and security of the data collected by the new technology. This Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) promises to increase energy efficiency, bolster electric power grid reliability, and facilitate demand response, among other benefits. However, to fulfill these ends, smart meters must record near-real time data on consumer electricity usage and transmit the data to utilities over great distances via communications networks that serve the smart grid. Detailed electricity usage data offers a window into the lives of people inside of a home by revealing what individual appliances they are using, and the transmission of the data potentially subjects this information to interception or theft by unauthorized third parties or hackers. Unforeseen consequences under federal law may result from the installation of smart meters and the communications technologies that accompany them. This report examines federal privacy and cybersecurity laws that may apply to consumer data collected by residential smart meters. It begins with an examination of the constitutional provisions in the Fourth Amendment that may apply to the data. As we progress into the 21st century, access to personal data, including information generated from smart meters, is a new frontier for police investigations. The Fourth Amendment generally requires police to have probable cause to search an area in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. However, courts have used the third-party doctrine to deny protection to information a customer gives to a business as part of their commercial relationship. This rule is used by police to access bank records, telephone records, and traditional utility records. Nevertheless, there are several core differences between smart meters and the general third-party cases that may cause concerns about its application. These include concerns expressed by the courts and Congress about the ability of technology to potentially erode individuals' privacy. If smart meter data and transmissions fall outside of the protection of the Fourth Amendment, they may still be protected from unauthorized disclosure or access under the Stored Communications Act (SCA), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). These statutes, however, would appear to permit law enforcement to access smart meter data for investigative purposes under procedures provided in the SCA, ECPA, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), subject to certain conditions. Additionally, an electric utility's privacy and security practices with regard to consumer data may be subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has recently focused its consumer protection enforcement on entities that violate their privacy policies or fail to protect data from unauthorized access. This authority could apply to electric utilities in possession of smart meter data, provided that the FTC has statutory jurisdiction over them. General federal privacy safeguards provided under the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 (FPA) protect smart meter data maintained by federal agencies, including data held by federally owned electric utilities. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This paper investigates how EM information leakage changes with the configuration of the information hardware, focusing on the frequency characteristics of the hardware. We assume that the frequency characteristics of the EM radiation correspond to physical aspects of the hardware configuration. To address the issue of information leakage, this paper presents a novel analysis of EM radiation from information hardware by using a model circuit board. Using this model, we show that the intensity of the EM emissions can be correlated to the layout of the hardware. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","electromagnetic information leakage; information security; side-channel attacks","Electromagnetism; Security of data; Circuit boards; Cryptographic hardware; Electromagnetic information; EM radiation; Frequency characteristic; Hardware configurations; Information leakage; Normal operating conditions; Physical aspects; Secret information; Side channel attack; Hardware"

No one knows which e-mail is more important among e-mails when he/she receives many e-mails at once and he/she has not so much time to examine. Furthermore, threshold in the filtering is very sensitive. If it is set high, some of important e-mails would be filtered and deleted by mistake.

A new methodology to ensure enhanced security of information in images through the use of encryption and multiplexing is proposed in this paper. We use orthogonal encoding scheme to encode multiple information independently and then combine them together to save storage space and transmission bandwidth. The encoded and multiplexed image is encrypted employing multiple reference-based joint transform correlation. The encryption key is fed into four channels which are relatively phase shifted by different amounts. The input image is introduced to all the channels and then Fourier transformed to obtain joint power spectra (JPS) signals. The resultant JPS signals are again phase-shifted and then combined to form a modified JPS signal which yields the encrypted image after having performed an inverse Fourier transformation. The proposed cryptographic system makes the confidential information absolutely inaccessible to any unauthorized intruder, while allows for the retrieval of the information to the respective authorized recipient without any distortion. The proposed technique is investigated through computer simulations under different practical conditions in order to verify its overall robustness. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Joint transform correlation; Multiplexing; Orthogonal code","Biometrics; Computer simulation; Cryptography; Encoding (symbols); Fourier transforms; Multiplexing; Phase shift; Security of data; Confidential information; Cryptographic systems; Fourier transformations; Joint transform correlation; Orthogonal code; Personal identification; Research and development; Transmission bandwidth; Search engines"

One of the widely used approaches for information security is Cryptography. Cryptanalysis is a way to break cryptography without having the encryption key. This paper presents an approach to the cryptanalysis of transposition ciphers using an improved GA with a novel fitness function. The fitness function is evaluated based on the most common bigrams and trigrams. Dynamic population size is proposed and also the crossover and mutation operators are taken randomly. Results show that the proposed algorithm is effective for cryptanalysis of transposition cipher with long key lengths up to 25 due to its strong reliability. The algorithm has also high convergence speed and minimum error. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Cryptanalysis; Encryption key; Genetic Algorithm (GA); Stable convergence Performance; Transposition Cipher",""

Increased use and reliance on technologies complicate the process of providing information security. This expanding complexity in supplying data security requirements coupled with the increased recognition of the value of information, have led to the need to quickly advance the information security area. In this paper, we examine the maturation of the information security area by analyzing the innovation activity of one of the largest and most ubiquitous information technology companies, Microsoft. We conduct a textual analysis of their patent application activity in the information security domain since the early 2000's using a novel text analysis approach based on concepts from social network analysis and algorithmic classification. We map our analysis to focal areas in information security and examine it against Microsoft's own history, in order to determine the depth and breadth of Microsoft's innovations. Our analysis shows the relevance of using a network-based text analysis. Specifically, we find that Microsoft has increasingly emphasized topics that fall into the identity and access management area. We also show that Microsoft's innovations in information security showed tremendous growth after their Trustworthy Computing Initiative was announced. In addition, we are able to determine areas of focus that correspond to Microsoft's major vulnerabilities. These findings indicate that while Microsoft is still actively, albeit not always successfully, fighting vulnerabilities in their products, they are quite vigorously and broadly innovating in the information security area. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A two-part strategy to decrease exposure and mitigate possible consequences was recommended for a realm where the consensus was that some degree of infiltration is nearly inevitable. Cybersecurity is becoming a focus across many business sectors, but the energy industry, including pipelines, has particular vulnerability. According to Gen. Michael Hayden, former head of the CIA and NSA, now consultant for the Chertoff Group, oil and gas companies make an attractive target. The infiltration of Telvent's systems in September 2012, for instance, involved both installation of malware and theft of files concerning its OASyS SCADA system, popular among pipeline companies. finding an intruder on a low-information SCADA network is extremely concerning. Although digital battles are a classic example of asymmetric warfare, with clear advantages to the offense, few reported events have been of a destructive nature and none aimed at terrorist goals. According to IHS Director of Global Energy Services Michael Wynne, automation requires tight observation. Some viruses are slow-moving but hard to detect, and pervasive in things like SCADA.

This is a way of shifting from the hardware and software demands of storing and organizing data, to information access concerns. That is because with the exponential growth in information sources and all accompanying complexities, the limited capacity of libraries to host their own in its entirety necessitates opting for alternatives in the cloud. Design/methodology/approach: A review of current literature about the topic was performed Findings: Literature used reveals that currently, libraries are using the cloud for putting together user resources, i.e. using Software as a Service (SaaS), such as in library catalogues, WorldCat, Googledocs, and the aggregated subject gateways like SUMMON, and others; the web Platform as a Service (PaaS) as in the use of GoogleApp Engine; or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) as in the use of D-Space, FEDORA, and others. The cloud is confirmed as a facilitator in storing and accessing information in addition to providing a unified web presence with reduced local storage capacity challenges. Originality/value: The value of these findings is to remind librarians of the shift in focus towards which devices provide the easiest access to data and applications. This is one of the reasons they in many instances are currently having to address issues relating to the use of electronic media tools such as smartphones, iPad, e-book readers, and other handheld devices. The largely borderless information resources also bring to the forefront considerations about digital rights management, fair use, information security, ownership and control of data, privacy, scholarly publishing, copyright guidance, and licensing that the librarian has to be knowledgeable about. It has become necessary for librarians who make use of commercial cloud services to be conversant with the implications on institutional data. To avert the ever present dangers and risks involving cyber-security, it is usually practical for institutions to keep policies, procedures, fiscal, and personnel data in private clouds that have carefully crafted access permissions. Being aware of these implications enables thoughtful, adaptive planning strategies for the future of library practice and service. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Cloud computing; IaaS; Interoperability; PaaS; SaaS; Web 2.0",""

We identify four system mechanisms that heighten an individual's perception of accountability: identifiability, awareness of logging, awareness of audit, and electronic presence. These accountability mechanisms substantially reduce intentions to commit access policy violations.

This Article begins by applauding Komesar's insistence, all too rare in political debates, that there are significant market failures and government failures. It then builds on Komesar's approach to assess the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) medical privacy rule, the 2009 support for EHRs in the stimulus law, the current Internet privacy debates, and the ongoing debates about whether federal legislation is needed for cybersecurity. First, the HIPAA privacy rule illustrates how one approach may be the best available, even with its known flaws. Despite plenty of warts as HIPAA went into effect, my judgment a dozen years later is that it was appropriate to create national health privacy standards by regulation. Second, the apparent success of the 2009 health IT funding illustrates how government action can overcome market failures caused by the difficulty and cost of coordinating among numerous actors. The stimulus bill provided $19 billion as incentives for providers to shift to electronic clinical records. My judgment is that the financial incentives and meaningful use standards have kickstarted a major new round of adoption of EHRs. Third, the Internet privacy discussion shows serious enough flaws in the market/self-regulatory approach to make legislation appear preferable. For the initial phase of the Internet, through the late 1990s, I believe the best choice quite possibly was the position taken by President Bill Clinton's administration. The policy was to encourage industry self-regulation, backed up by Federal Trade Commission enforcement if industry fell short of its promises. Today, however, there is now an infrastructure to write, enforce, and comply with baseline privacy rules for the Internet. Fourth, the cybersecurity discussion reminds us that government failures may outweigh market failures even where some market failures are apparent. The pessimistic conclusion that legislation cannot cause any real increase in security leaves me, at this time, without a convincing strategy for improving cybersecurity on the Internet. Finally, the discussion of adjudication shows that courts are unlikely to be the appropriate institution for many issues of privacy, security, or health information technology. Courts are relatively good at adjudicating whether a specific violation has occurred in the past; they are much less effective at guiding the design of complex technological systems that evolve rapidly.","",""

However, this type of companies requires ISMSs which have been adapted to their specific characteristics, and these systems must be optimized from the point of view of the resources necessary to deploy and maintain them. Over the last 10 years, the authors have obtained considerable experience in the establishment of ISMSs, and during this time, they have observed that the structure and characteristics of SMEs as regards security management are frequently very similar (since they can all be grouped by business size and sector), thus signifying that it is possible to construct patterns for ISMSs that can be reused and refined. In this chapter, the authors present the strategy that they have designed to manage and reuse security information in information system security management. This strategy is framed within a methodology designed for integral security management and its information systems maturity, denominated as ""Methodology for Security Management and Maturity in Small and Medium-size Enterprises (MSM2-SME),"" and it is defined in a reusable model called ""Reusable Pattern for Security Management (RPSM),"" which systematically defines, manages, and reuses the aforementioned methodology through a sub-process denominated as ""Generation of Security Management Patterns (GSMP).""

Based on the sureness score, mobile devices can dynamically request the user to provide active authentication (such as a strong password), or disable certain features of the mobile devices to protect user's privacy and information security. In this paper, we model such gesture patterns through a continuous n-gram language model using a set of features constructed from these sensors. We built mobile application prototype based on this model and use it to perform both user classification and user authentication experiments.

Findings: The values of information entropy calculated in real time with the use of the rolling window method are an effective indicator of anomalous IP network states and can be used for intrusion detection in information security systems management. Originality: The algorithm for calculating the information entropy allowing significant speeding up the calculations in comparison with the classical algorithm by using a moving window method and performing them in real time has been proposed.

The result is a proof-of-concept implementation, HIDE-DHCP, which integrates three different covert channels each of which accommodate to different stealthiness and capacity requirements. Finally, we provide a theoretical and experimental analysis of this tool in terms of its reliability, capacity, and detectability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, information security has become a major concern among online users, and the verification of access codes is now the main practice used to keep information systems safe. However, some issues arise as the result of coding and managing behavior, and this research seeks to address these issues. After following the Focus Group method and interviewing 13 college students, this research finds that forgetting the access code is one of the biggest challenges to most online users simply because of the longer duration and the time when the users have a need to access the websites again, their memory will eclipse. In addition, online users usually develop self-constructed rules to cope with elusive code. These rules include: creating some sets of code that may not be meaningful to outsiders; taking different degrees of complex measures to register authentication codes, dependent upon the importance of the websites to the online users; writing the authentication codes on a scratchpad and sticking it on the computer screen; and keeping the codes in a notebook or computer file. The above practices nevertheless run the risk of being usurped by hackers, and it is found that hacking frequently takes place among closest friends, as they are quite familiar with the coding behavior of the victims. While assisting coding management does not help in this regard, as it is generally too expensive, online users troubled by the forgetting of access codes often end up with re-applying for a new set of authentication codes after unsuccessfully trying to login. All these self-constructed rules, nevertheless, constitute threat to information security. The research, in conclusion, calls for an education campaign to promote healthy coding behavior and effective coding management. The obtained findings provide valuable references for both academicians and practitioners to understand the online users' coding behaviors and to effectively manage them accordingly to improve the resulting information security. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Most recently, Apple, Facebook, and Twitter acknowledged that they were attacked and were now taking additional measures to secure their networks. In January of 2013, Kaspersky Labs reported discovering malware that not only targeted government information in Eastern Europe, former Soviet republics, and Central Asia, but also had been actively doing so since 2007. The scope of global cyber attacks is staggering and the solutions to securing property and protecting national security are illusive, in large part because infrastructure is owned and operated by private, rather than public, entities. Nations struggle with choosing the most effective strategy and potential regulation of the private sector in order to reduce overall cybersecurity risk. This paper reviews the nature of cyber threats, and compares the United States and European approach to promoting cybersecurity in the private sector. Furthermore, the paper discusses how different approaches can affect cybersecurity risk, and suggests a framework for visualizing the impact of law and strategy on security. © 2013 Janine S.

However, a wireless node endures with lots of constraints such as low computation ability, little memory, partial energy resources and so on. In secure communication, different numbers of end devices are used to share the information between wireless devices and also are protected with the help of crypto algorithm and secret keys. The secret keys play a very important role than the algorithm, to ensure the security of the information between different numbers of users. When members of a group need to accept the similar information security and are permitted to dynamically join or leave the group, security entails not only sharing of a secret among lots of users but also be worried with security services like confidentiality, integrity of information as the connection changes. Whenever the system changes, the system manager is responsible to change the secret and supporting keys and to send back the updated keys to the group members. These different numbers of secret keys used in the end devices are generated using software and hardware techniques. In this study the different numbers of secret keys are generated using hardware.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of ScratchPad Memory virtualization, a hardware/software run-time layer (called SPMVisor) that virtualizes the scratchpad memory space in order to facilitate the use of distributed SPMs in an efficient, transparent and secure manner. We introduce the notion of virtual scratchpad memories (vSPMs), which can be dynamically created and managed as regular SPMs. The SPMVisor exploits policy-driven allocation strategies based on application privilege levels and data level prioritization metrics (e.g., utilization) to efficiently manage the on-chip memory real-estate. Our experimental results on Mediabench/CHStone benchmarks running on various Chip-Multiprocessor configurations and software stacks (RTOS, virtualization, secure execution) showed that SPMVisor enhances performance by 71 % on average and reduces power consumption by 79 % on average with respect to traditional context switching schemes.We showed the benefits of using vSPMs in a various environments (a RTOS multi-tasking environment, a virtualization environment, and a trusted execution environment). Furthermore, we explored the effects of mapping instructions and data onto vSPMs, and showed that sharing on-chip space reduces both execution time and energy by an average 16 % and 12 % respectively. We then compared our priority-driven memory allocation scheme with traditional dynamic allocation and showed an average 54 % execution time reduction and 65 % energy savings. Finally, to further validate the SPMVisor’s benefits, we modified the initial bus-based architecture to include a mesh-based CMP with up to 4 × 4 nodes. We were able to observe that SPMVisor’s priority-driven allocator was able to reduce execution time by an average 17 % with respect to competing allocation policies, while saving an average 65 % across various architectural configurations.We were also able to observe that SPMVisor reduces execution time by an average 12.6 % with respect to competing allocation policies, while saving an average 63.5 % in total energy for various architectural configuration running 1024 jobs. © The Author(s) 2013.","Chip-multiprocessors; Embedded systems; Information assurance; Policy; Scratchpad memory; Security; Virtualization","Adaptive systems; Benchmarking; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Multiprocessing systems; Public policy; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Allocation strategy; Chip Multiprocessor; Information assurance; Multi-core platforms; Scratch pad memory; Security; Trusted applications; Trusted execution environments; Memory architecture"

From this point of view, a robust blind watermarking method based on Discrete Cosine Transform for colour images is proposed in this paper. The proposed method provides hiding a binary watermark in a compressed Digital Colour Image. First, the Digital Color Image is transformed into YCbCr from RGB color space and then the Discrete Cosine Transform middle band of the luminance (Y) component is used for watermarking processes. Each bit of the binary watermark is embedded in a different Discrete Cosine Transform block. Thus, deterioration on the image is minimized achieving high invisibility. The situation is checked whether the watermark is lost after the image saved. If the watermark is lost in any block, the average of some neighbouring Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients is used for embedding the watermark bit. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be safely used when point of interest is binary watermarks. Moreover, extraction processes do not need the cover image and the watermark is recovered completely. Statistical and perceptual quality evaluations show that the proposed method is better than its counterparts.","Digital image; Discrete cosine transform; Invisible watermarking; YCbCr transform",""

Such systems may control vital vehicle functions such as steering, braking and/or propulsion independently of the driver. In today's vehicles, much emphasis has been placed on helping ensure that these safety-critical vehicle systems operate as intended. Applying rigorous system safety engineering principles in developing these safety-critical automotive systems helps ensure that they operate as desired and expected. Less emphasis has been placed to-date on helping ensure cybersecurity of cyber-physical automotive systems. However, this is changing as both the world and the automotive industry become more aware of the potential ramifications of cyber-attacks on vehicles. As with system safety, applying a rigorous system security engineering process to the development of cyber-physical automotive systems is beneficial and will help reduce the likelihood of successful attacks on vehicles. System security and system safety interact with one another and cannot be considered in isolation. However, there are also differences between system security and system safety that require unique engineering activities to be performed to address these unique aspects. This paper describes some of the differences and similarities between system security and system safety, between safety-critical systems and security-critical systems, and between system safety and system security engineering, and presents a system security engineering process for applying to cyber-physical automotive systems that is based on the ISO 26262 process framework. © 2013 SAE International.","","Automotive industry; Computer crime; Safety engineering; Security systems; Automotive Systems; Engineering activities; Engineering principles; Process framework; Safety critical systems; Safety-critical; Security-critical; Vehicle functions; Vehicles"

Botnets have been used as the main vector in carrying many cyber crimes reported in the recent news. While a significant amount of research has been accomplished on botnet analysis and detection, several challenges remain unaddressed, such as the ability to design detectors which can cope with new forms of botnets. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect botnet activity based on traffic behavior analysis by classifying network traffic behavior using machine learning. Traffic behavior analysis methods do not depend on the packets payload, which means that they can work with encrypted network communication protocols. Network traffic information can usually be easily retrieved from various network devices without affecting significantly network performance or service availability. We study the feasibility of detecting botnet activity without having seen a complete network flow by classifying behavior based on time intervals. Using existing datasets, we show experimentally that it is possible to identify the presence of existing and unknown botnets activity with high accuracy even with very small time windows. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), when implemented in the E-governance domain, combines all the government functions together into one single integrated system with a central database. This system serves the information needs of all the departments across geographies, while allowing them to communicate with each other. For this it is necessary to understand that government has become more dependent on modern technologies that have the potential to create seamless, responsive, and citizen-centric government for the benefit of all. At the same time, it has become increasingly vulnerable to a range of risks, from interruption of operations that are based on computers to loss of confidential data. Government agencies at all levels (national, provincial, and local) must protect the computer systems that they own and operate. Information security requires a combination of business, management, and technical measures in an on-going process. Security is costly, but like privacy, it should be addressed in the design phase and periodically reviewed. This chapter contributes to the ERP enabled E-governance literature for understanding threats and risks, clarification and investigation of the techniques in mitigating these challenges and issues involved in improving E-governance security. The interest generated by the ERP phenomenon in the public sector, and the peculiarities of this sector make specific studies of ERP in government organizations necessary.

Recently, Yeh et al. proposed an ECC-based user authentication protocol for preventing all the security problems of the previous schemes. They claimed that their protocol preserves mutual authentication and protected from several attacks. However, in this article, we point out that Yeh et al.'s protocol cannot provide the protection against the private key disclosure attack, smart card lost problems, off-line password guessing attack, authentication key disclosure attack, session key disclosure attack and many logged-in users' attack.

In this algorithm, first, the original image is decomposed into low-pass subband and high-pass subband coefficients via the DWT, and the low-pass ones are sorted out by using the quantum Logistic map with random sequences, followed by an inverse DWT to obtain a shuffled image. Then, each pixel of the shuffled image is mixed with the chaotic sequence generated by the quantum Logistic system, and the quantum Logistic system is perturbed to substitute for pixel values adaptively. Thus, better diffusion effect is achieved.

Information fusion is performed in the gradient map domain. The image fusion of infrared image and corresponding visual gradient image is done in wavelet domain by taking the maximum information of approximation and detailed coefficients. These fused images have been taken for dimension reduction using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The reduced face images are taken for training and testing purposes from different classes of different datasets of IRIS face database. SVM multiclass strategy 'one-vs.-all' have been taken in the experiment. For training support vector machine, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm has been used.

In accordance with the region stationary characteristic of the image source, a new steganalytic method that can exploit the image region randomness features is proposed based on analyzing the changes of the regional randomness caused by the least significant bit (LSB) matching steganography. First of all, a given image is separated into a great many of block regions, and the regional LSB sequences are extracted from the pixel sequences of each block region which are obtained by the Hilbert scanning. Furthermore, the parameter which is derived from a LSB sequence with the bit XOR operation, is defined as the region randomness measurement index. Finally, the histogram of the index is calculated and analyzed; three sorts of histogram features including the information entropy, the special histogram values, and the moments are extracted; and the Fisher linear discriminator is applied for classifying the cover images and stego images. Extensive experimental results on three grayscale image databases with different embedding rates show that the proposed approach has good performance in detecting LSB matching steganographic scheme, and it obviously outperforms the previous typical steganalytic algorithms.","Histogram; Image region; Least significant bit matching; Randomness; Steganalysis","Graphic methods; Image processing; Random processes; Steganography; Histogram; Image regions; Least significant bit matching; Randomness; Steganalysis; Image matching"

However, security experts questioned the effectiveness of IDSs recently. The criticism known as Base Rate fallacy states that when IDS raises an alarm, the event is more likely to be benign rather than intrusive since the proportion of benign activity is significantly larger than that of intrusive activity in the user population. In response to too many false alarms, system security officers (SSO) either ignore alarm signals or turn off the IDS as the information provided by IDS is very skeptical. To alleviate this problem of IDSs, Ogut et al. (2008) [6] suggest that the firm may choose to wait to get additional signal and to make better decision about user type. One of the limitations of their model is that configuration point at which IDSs operate (the false negative and false positive rates) is exogenously given. However, the firm trying to minimize expected cost should also make a decision regarding the configuration level of IDSs since these probabilities are one of the determinants of future cost. Therefore, we extend Ogut et al. (2008) [6] by considering configuration and waiting time decisions jointly in this paper. We formulate the problem as dynamic programming model and illustrate the solution procedure for waiting time and configuration decision under optimal policy when cost of undetected hacker activity follows step wise function. As it is difficult to obtain waiting time and configuration decision under optimal policy, we illustrate the solution procedures for under myopic policy and focus on the characteristics of configuration decision under myopic policy. Our numerical analysis suggested that configuration decision is as important as waiting time decision to decrease the cost of operating IDS. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously demonstrated that a primitive single-celled amoeba (a plasmodial slime mold), which exhibits complex spatiotemporal oscillatory dynamics and sophisticated computing capabilities, can be used to search for a solution to a very hard combinatorial optimization problem. We successfully extracted the essential spatiotemporal dynamics by which the amoeba solves the problem. This amoeba-inspired computing paradigm can be implemented by various physical systems that exhibit suitable spatiotemporal dynamics resembling the amoeba's problem-solving process. In this Article, we demonstrate that photoexcitation transfer phenomena in certain quantum nanostructures mediated by optical near-field interactions generate the amoebalike spatiotemporal dynamics and can be used to solve the satisfiability problem (SAT), which is the problem of judging whether a given logical proposition (a Boolean formula) is self-consistent. SAT is related to diverse application problems in artificial intelligence, information security, and bioinformatics and is a crucially important nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-complete problem, which is believed to become intractable for conventional digital computers when the problem size increases. We show that our amoeba-inspired computing paradigm dramatically outperforms a conventional stochastic search method.

While this type of data is relatively inexpensive to gather, it can pose multiple security and privacy risks, even if the location tracks are anonymous. In particular, creating bogus location tracks and sending them to the system is relatively easy. This bogus data could perturb traffic flow estimates, and disrupt the transportation system whenever these estimates are used for actuation. In this article, we propose a new framework for solving a variety of privacy and cybersecurity problems arising in transportation systems. The state of traffic is modeled by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic flow model, which is a first order scalar conservation law with concave flux function. Given a set of traffic flow data, we show that the constraints resulting from this partial differential equation are mixed integer linear inequalities for some decision variable. The resulting framework is very flexible, and can in particular be used to detect spoofing attacks in real time, or carry out attacks on location tracks.

Coordinated cyber attacks on power meter readings can be designed to be undetectable by any bad data detection algorithm. These unobservable attacks present a serious threat to grid operations. Of particular interest are sparse attacks that involve the compromise of a modest number of meter readings. An efficient algorithm to find all unobservable attacks [under standard DC load flow approximations] involving the compromise of exactly two power injection meters and an arbitrary number of power meters on lines is presented. This requires O(n2m) flops for a power system with n buses and m line meters. If all lines are metered, there exist canonical forms that characterize all 3, 4, and 5-sparse unobservable attacks.

The increase in technological complexity of medical devices and systems does not only improve efficiency, but also influences the risks of loss and change of personal health information. The most important problems of information security in healthcare are the access control to medical personal data and security data transmission. In this paper it is illustrated how these two problems can be solved with a biometric approach. The biometric technology using heart sounds and acoustic characteristics of the circulatory system allows for construction of flexible information security systems, adapted to the specific characteristics of medical electronic devices. Unlike other biometric technologies, the system of human authentication using heart sounds does not require active data input and provides a reliable working system. In this approach the information security system uses the data that a medical device gets during human condition monitoring. This feature does not complicate a medical device by system information security. © 2013 WIT Press.","Authentication system; Biometrics; Healthcare; Heart sound; Information security","Authentication; Bioacoustics; Biomedical equipment; Biometrics; Cardiology; Cardiovascular system; Condition monitoring; Data communication systems; Health care; Medical problems; Security systems; Acoustic characteristic; Authentication systems; Biometric technology; Flexible information security; Heart sounds; Human authentication; Personal health informations; Technological complexity; Security of data"

At the juncture that social requirement for privacy protection is getting important, the development of standard and specification to evaluate the minimum security level of u-health medical devices is inevitable as a prerequisite for the vitalization of u-health. This study aimed at the development of security test methodology for u-health medical devices and proposed the standard and specification to secure medical information security. For the purpose, first, we defined the scope of u-health medical devices and categorized its physical and operational types. Second, security core technologies were selected that can be applied to u-health medical device in three aspects such as administrative safeguard dealing with operator, policy, document, system and user education, physical safeguard dealing with control of entrance and exit, screen or shared instrument, and technical safeguard dealing with computer system-related technological elements. Lastly, each security core technology was assigned to each physical and operational types of u-health medical devices and relative significance of which was determined.

These risks were detected with a novel approach to information security. It is based on the philosophy that information security risk monitoring should include human and societal factors, and that collaboration between organisations and experts is essential to gain knowledge about potential risks. The methodology uses a mixed methods approach including a quantitative analysis of historical security incident data and expert elicitation through a Delphi study. The result is an overview of the possible socio-technical risks that a panel of experts expect to materialise in health care organisations in the near future. These risks include (amongst others): staff leaving data assets unattended on the premises and these assets consequently go missing, staff sharing passwords to access patient data and staff sending email containing personal patient data to the wrong addressee thus disclosing data to unauthorised persons. The expert panel recognized risks from current discussion topics such as outsourcing, but these risks are still considered to appear less frequently than the more traditional information security risks. Furthermore, the panel did not estimate a high frequency of occurrence of socio-technical information security risks caused by new technologies such as cloud computing or RFID. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A major challenge in devising such systems is to overcome the obstacles of the potentially limited communication from the group to the sender, the unavailability of a fully trusted key generation center, and the dynamics of the sender. The existing key management paradigms cannot deal with these challenges effectively. In this paper, we circumvent these obstacles and close this gap by proposing a novel key management paradigm. The new paradigm is a hybrid of traditional broadcast encryption and group key agreement. In such a system, each member maintains a single public/secret key pair. Upon seeing the public keys of the members, a remote sender can securely broadcast to any intended subgroup chosen in an ad hoc way. Following this model, we instantiate a scheme that is proven secure in the standard model. Even if all the nonintended members collude, they cannot extract any useful information from the transmitted messages. After the public group encryption key is extracted, both the computation overhead and the communication cost are independent of the group size. Furthermore, our scheme facilitates simple yet efficient member deletion/addition and flexible rekeying strategies. Its strong security against collusion, its constant overhead, and its implementation friendliness without relying on a fully trusted authority render our protocol a very promising solution to many applications. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Access control; ad hoc networks; broadcast; cooperative computing; information security; key management","Access control; Ad hoc networks; Communication; Security of data; broadcast; Broadcast encryption; Computation overheads; Cooperative computing; Key generation centers; Key management; Limited communication; Trusted authorities; Public key cryptography"

In the teleradiology network system, the security of information network is very important subjects. We are studying the secret sharing scheme and the tokenization as a method safely to store or to transmit the confidential medical information used with the teleradiology network system. Secret sharing scheme is a method of dividing the confidential medical information into two or more tallies. Our method has the function of automatic backup. With automatic backup technology, if there is a failure in a single tally, there is redundant data already copied to other tally. Confidential information is preserved at an individual Data Center connected through internet because individual medical information cannot be decoded by using one tally at all. Therefore, even if one of the Data Centers is struck and information is damaged due to the large area disaster, the confidential medical information can be decoded by using the tallies preserved at the data center to which it escapes damage. Moreover, by using tokenization, the history information of dividing the confidential medical information into two or more tallies is prevented from lying scattered by replacing the history information with another character string. As a result, information is available only to those who have rightful access it and the sender of a message and the message itself are verified at the receiving point.

We detect the regions of interest (e.g. faces of people), which are protected by means of the alteration of the coefficients of the compressed video stream. The proposed protection guarantees the property of reversibility, since the original coefficients can be restored. Specifically, we elaborate on the definition of the Protection Stream, which is required for both protecting and unprotecting a video sequence. We propose a procedure for securely generating a protection stream for each group of pictures, thus avoiding the large unsecure streams required if the protection stream was generated for each video file. The proposed model has been implemented and tested, and the results confirm the real time performance of the system developed while keeping the aforementioned crucial properties. © 2013 ACM.","","Security of data; Compressed video stream; Group of pictures; Privacy preserving; Real time performance; Regions of interest; Video files; Video sequences; Video surveillance; Security systems"

Signcryption has been shown to be useful in many applications, such as electronic commerce, mobile communications and smart cards. In 2009, Yu etal. [12] proposed an identity-based signcryption (IBSC) scheme in the standard model. In 2010, Zhang.

He proved that the improved scheme has the IND-CCA2 property and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks (EUF-CMA). However, in this paper, an attack is proposed to show that Zhang's scheme does not have the IND-CCA2 property (not even chosen plaintext attacks (IND-CPA)).

In doing so, they often face similar problems, for which they have to create appropriate solutions. An exchange of knowledge between experts would be desirable in order to prevent developing always the same solutions by independent persons. Such an exchange could also lead to solutions of higher quality, as existing approaches could be advanced, instead of always reinventing the security wheel. This paper examines how information security knowledge can be shared between different organizations on the basis of a web portal utilizing Web-Protégé. It can be shown that through the use of ontologies the domain of information security can be modeled and stored in a human- and a machine-readable format, enabling both human editing and automation (e.g. for risk calculations). The evaluation of the web portal has shown that the most important challenge a tool for knowledge sharing has to face is the aspect of motivating users to participate in a knowledge exchange. Results from the evaluation have been used to further develop and enhance the web portal by implementing additional facilitating features. These features include a credit system, which rewards users for contributions, as well as the ability to select multiple entities, improving the system's usability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The European Union (EU) Network and Information Security (NIS) policy combines public and private policies at the level of the operators which are highly interdependent. Any NIS policy success rests to an overwhelming degree on the commitment and compliance of the ICT infrastructure operators. Increasingly, policy makers have to pay attention to the supporting governance system which would give best effect to the NIS policy objectives. This contribution focuses on NIS governance in the EU and explores mechanisms of cooperation between public and private operating ICT infrastructure through the lens of governance theory. It concludes that NIS governance objectives can be pursued in public-private partnerships, but not all functions of NIS policy can be suitably performed at the EU level. Any engagement with the industry needs to be supported by appropriate governance mechanisms that deliver high levels of commitment and compliance by private stakeholders. Against this backdrop this paper critically assesses the European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R) and offers recommendations for EU policy makers on a suitable Europe-wide multi-stakeholder governance framework to promote NIS strategy and high-level policy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.

Security knowledge sharing substantially reduces risk and investment in information security. Despite the importance of information security, little research based on knowledge sharing has focused on the security profession. Therefore, this study analyses key factors, containing attitude, self-efficacy, trust, norm of reciprocity, and shared language, in respect of the information security workers intention to share knowledge. Information security professionals in virtual communities, including the Information Security Professional Association (ISPA), Information Systems Security Association (ISSA), Society of Information Risk Analysts (SIRA), and LinkedIn security groups, were surveyed to test the proposed research model. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique were used to analyse the data and evaluate the research model. The results showed that the research model fit the data well and the structural model suggests a strong relationship between attitude, trust, and norms of reciprocity to knowledge sharing intention. Hypotheses regarding the influence of self-efficacy and reciprocity, to knowledge sharing attitude were upheld. Shared language did not influence either the attitude or intention to share knowledge. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

IDS is a special embedded device or relied software package which process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network (WLAN (Wi-Fi, Wimax)) and LAN ((Ethernet, FDDI, ADSL, Token ring) based) and analysing them for sign of possible incident which are violations or forthcoming threats of violations of computer security policies or standard security policies (i.e., DMA acts).

In its search for solutions to address privacy dilemmas raised by smart meters, the Government has been content with using data protection principles as a policy framework to regulate the processing of consumers' personal information. This is worrying since the question of who has access to what type of information and how it is used cannot simply be regarded as raising information security, authenticity and integrity issues. If we are to go beyond the rhetoric of protecting the privacy rights of energy consumers we must scrutinise the context in which legitimate interests and reasonable expectations of privacy subsist. To remedy this apparent policy oversight, the paper undertakes two tasks: first, to clarify the content and application of data protection and privacy rights to smart meters; and second, it outlines a policy framework that will address the lack of specificity on how best innovation and privacy issues can be better calibrated. More importantly, it calls for targeted substantive reforms, development of accessible privacy policies and information management practices that promote transparency and accountability and deployment of technological solutions that will help reduce emerging fault lines between innovation and privacy in this sphere of energy policymaking. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Data protection; Privacy; Smart meters",""

A leakage of information about the cryptosystem used by either a fatal shortcoming or an insider enemy can easily defeat the cryptographic goal. An adversary may succeed in decrypting ciphertexts, while users of a particular cryptosystem unwarily continue using same vulnerable encryption techniques. Such major concerns motivate the development of a novel Innocent-Cipher-Based Cryptography Paradigm (Innocipher), which is presented in this paper. Innocipher focuses on high level security that protects private information through two phases. First, Innocipher system conceals the required data in a legible form of legitimate plaintext other than ciphertext, for example, legitimate text, graph, game, and image, that looks benign and legitimate. Second, it converts the output of the first phase, the encoded data in the legible form, into a ciphertext. The main advantage of the Innocipher paradigm is that if a worst case scenario occurred, which is an adversary succeeding in decrypting a cipher message, then an adversary will be fooled by getting a legible form of legitimate text. At this point, the adversary will stop any further investigation while an original message is not revealed. This fooling mechanism of Innocipher is the key-feature that enables a multilayer of security for protecting valuable information. The presented implementation and validation of Innocipher demonstrates the robust capabilities of achieving the goal of securing information in static stage and during data transmission to its legitimate recipient. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","computer security; cryptography; information security; network security; secure communications","Network security; Security of data; Ciphertexts; Encryption technique; Plaintext; Private information; Robust capability; Secure communications; Worst case scenario; Cryptography"

Therefore, in order to choose the best frequency range for receiving the electromagnetic compromising emanations form a PC display effectively and quickly, a method based on the correlation power analysis (CPA) and the common equipments is proposed. Firstly, the frequency spectrum of 10 MHz to 1 GHz is measured about 10 times respectively when the PC is displaying the white-black vertical strips image and black image. The frequency range which contains the display information can be obtained through the CPA. And then, the special image signal is searched around the dot frequency and harmonics. If the special signal disappears when displaying the total black image, it can be judged to be the real special signal. Finally, the best receiving frequency range can be chosen by comprehensive considering the results of CPA and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the special image signal.

In this thesis is proposed a new model of Network layer security where the chances of Eves-dropping or sniffing a packet at the Router is eliminated by using the Packet switched datagram concept of IPv4 where packets travel through unpredictable chain of Routers along multiple routes. The KEY to decrypt a Packet is not available in a static form, but dynamically generated depending on the location of the sender and travels as an Encrypted String producing a QR code image embedded in the payload. So, in a packet switched datagram approach, which does not guarantee that the successors of a packet must pass through the same router, following the same route, the chance of decrypting a sniffed packet at an EVIL Router is very little and we make it less and lesser following an incremental model to add to this concept, using GPS and other parameters of sender or receiver or both in the mathematical model of encryption to be used along with. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - This study examines the information security status of 24 federal agencies in the USA over the period 2002 through 2007 using latent growth modeling. The information security status of these agencies was tracked with the grades revealed in the Federal Computer Security Report Cards. In addition, the number of employees (internal threat incentives) and budgets incentives of federal agencies were gathered from the agencies and other governmental websites for the same period of time. Findings - Results indicated that high critical-information agencies even though they have an overall low performance in information security, they are performing better than the low critical-information agencies regarding solving external threats. Results also revealed that whereas agencies have generally paid more attention to information security over the years, their performances are more pertinent to change in budget incentives than other incentives. Research limitations/implications - The outcomes reported are confined to the data presented by the Federal Computer Security Report Cards. Another limitation is the number of employees that counts the total number of employees in the agencies whether they are related to the systems of the agencies or not. Finally, using a time-lag analysis of budget to predict the current security score would be more straightforward, but this could not be applied in this study due to the insufficient sample size, as ""the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform"" no longer released the report cards after 2007. Practical implications - The results should be of interest for the federal agencies that are included in this study, as well as for the organizations that are responsible for the information security of government agencies at different levels. Policy makers, IT managers, software developers and security specialists can also use the outcomes reported in this study for the better decision making that can enhance the information security in the public sector. The theoretical and methodological framework used in this study may also contribute to the current literature of homeland information security incentives and be helpful for future studies on its critical success factors. Originality/value - This study examines fundamental issues that have not yet to be established. To our knowledge, this is the first study that assesses different incentives that have an effect on the Federal agencies' information security performance because of the lack of data in this domain. Also, the statistical techniques used to test the research propositions fit the objective of the study. Not only this, but the results found in this research assure the importance of one of the incentives that has been identified in the literature as a crucial element that affects the information security performance of the organizations.

Then comes the biometric cryptosystem which blends the cryptography and biometrics to reflect the combined strength of the two fields along with wiping out some common drawbacks in them. The key is dynamically generated from the biometric data instead of storing somewhere and used for authentication or input to cryptographic algorithms.

In consequence, interest in this problem is increasing rapidly among the research community and the number of publications on the question has grown exponentially in recent years. This article proposes a taxonomy of botnet research and presents a survey of the field to provide a comprehensive overview of all these contributions. Furthermore, we hope to provide researchers with a clear perspective of the gaps that remain to be filled in our defenses against botnets. The taxonomy is based upon the botnet's life-cycle, defined as the sequence of stages a botnet needs to pass through in order to reach its goal. This approach allows us to consider the problem of botnets from a global perspective, which constitutes a key difference from other taxonomies that have been proposed. Under this novel taxonomy, we conclude that all attempts to defeat botnets should be focused on one or more stages of this life-cycle. In fact, the sustained hindering of any of the stages makes it possible to thwart a botnet's progress and thus render it useless. We test the potential capabilities of our taxonomy by means of a survey of current botnet research, and find it genuinely useful in understanding the focus of the different contributions in this field. © 2013 ACM.","Attack; Botnet; Defense; Detection; Survey; Taxonomy","Error detection; Life cycle; Research; Surveying; Surveys; Attack; Botnet; Botnets; Cyber security; Defense; Global perspective; Potential capability; Research communities; Taxonomies"

Relevant literature has presented numerous online bidding auction schemes considering different security issues. However, none of them can satisfy all essential properties simultaneously and some of them possess security vulnerabilities. For example, the winner cannot hold the properties of anonymity and unlinkability without re-registration for the auction of another product. In order to cope with the above problems, this study presents an e-auction scheme which owns the following features: every bidder's anonymity during the entire auction, unlinkability among plural auctions of different selling topics, unforgeability, no framing (tamper resistance of bidding tickets), non-repudiation, public verifiability of all bidding tickets, and easy revocation for illegal activities. In our e-bidding protocol, all participants can take part in a sequence of different auctions for various products unlimitedly after performing one time of registration, where the winner does not need to re-register again, either. We formally prove the security of the proposed scheme and also provide comparisons to show that it is the most efficient one as compared with previous works. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cryptography; E-commerce; Electronic auction; Information security","Cryptography; Electronic commerce; Internet protocols; Security of data; Electronic auction; Electronic platforms; Illegal activities; Non-repudiation; Public verifiability; Security issues; Security vulnerabilities; Tamper resistance; Commerce"

The goal of this paper will be to leave the reader with the understanding that there is no magic to implement a robust SWR strategy and also to show that there is an abundance of information available from a myriad of industry sources on the subject. I don't intend to list those sources here; the reader can just do an internet search. The point I am making is that like any good 'Bootlegger', my intent is to 'distill' various ingredients, in this case, industry knowledge on software reliability and adopt a strategy that bests suits my particular organization. This strategy can be adopted in its entirety or tweaked to suit specific organizational needs. Regardless of any strategy that is adopted, it is critical that appropriate statement of work or contract language needs to be specified when acquiring software from a supplier or developing it from an in-house source. Finally, like any idea this one needs a home. There were Software Reliability requirements in the Software Development Plan of a large, now cancelled, software intensive Army program but the requirements were nebulous and some of the reference documents were out of date. Unfortunately, a good number of software problems ultimately labeled 'Software Reliability defects' caused both formal laboratory and field testing delays. A robust SWR program may have avoided those costly rework efforts and delays. Unlike System Safety (incl Software) (MIL-STD-882E) or Information Assurance Certification (DIACAP), there is no official mandate or specific policy for Software Reliability Process compliance for Army Programs. However, I did manage to defend getting SWR contract language into the Ground Combat Systems contract. It called for collaboration between software and reliability subject matter experts to take appropriate steps to include software into the reliability case for the system. I also managed to obtain one fulltime equivalent work year of SWR engineering support to the Program. It was like planting a seed and the fruits of this labor are yet to be realized but progress has been made. © 2013 IEEE.","Defect Elimination; Failure Definition Scoring Criteria; Mission Critical Requirements; Software Reliability","Maintainability; Search engines; Seed; Software design; Software testing; Defect elimination; Development activity; Engineering support; Information assurance; Mission critical; Scoring criteria; Software intensive systems; Subject matter experts; Software reliability"

It allows to implement applications to Information Security, with major on anomaly detection Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Its key feature is the online selection of the number of mixture components together with the fitting parameter of each component. With many components the description is accurate. However, the computational burden increases as well. The best compromise between the description accuracy and the computational complexity is given by a derivation of the Minimum Message Length (MML) information criterion. The normal network behavior is assumed to be interpreted by the cluster with the highest covariance matrix, while the other smaller components are considered representing anomalies. We tested our technique with the well known KDD99 Cup data set, in order to clearly compare our findings with the other state of the art methods.

Using sentiment analyses and logistic regression, we identified features associated with performative hactivism. We then studied the blog remarks and used Website analytics to gain a better understanding of the implications for business security. The results from this work should help business and information security researchers (especially in social engineering), as well as business practice managers, strategists, and security analysts, to predict the lifecycles and impacts of hactivism on their operations and assist them in the creation of interventions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cyber hacking; hactivism; occupy movements; online dissent; online harassment","Personal computing; Security of data; Websites; hactivism; Logistic regressions; occupy movements; online dissent; online harassment; Provocative websites; Sentiment analysis; Social engineering; Internet"

For this reason, many institutions have developed programs to educate the students in the correct use of the new communication mediums. However, the concepts about information security require a lot of expert knowledge and are very difficult to explain appropriately.

CL-PKC has attracted special attention in the field of information security as it has opened new avenues for improvement in the present security architecture. Recently, Tsai et al. proposed an improved certificateless signature scheme without pairing and claimed that their new construction is secure against different kinds of attacks.

Most of the growth in this field is due to transfer of the traditional model of IT services to a novel model of cloud and the ubiquity of access to electronic and digital devices. Cloud computing posed a critical risk and challenges to digital investigators, but provides plenty of opportunities to investigators for improving the digital forensics. Moreover, cloud service providers and customers have yet to establish adequate forensic capabilities that could support investigations of criminal activities in the cloud. Notwithstanding the cloud presents some promising technical and economic benefits, users still resist to use cloud mainly due to security issues because it poses a challenge in doing cloud forensic investigations. Regarding this some research has been done, which propose solutions in doing forensic investigation. In this review paper, we take the first step towards reviewing the cloud forensics works that have been done by other researchers, and then do some discussion and analysis based on our findings to consider the opportunities and challenges confront the cloud forensics based on our findings.","Cloud computing; Digital forensic; Forensic challenges; Information security",""

Thereafter, patients may develop morbidity because of the complex reconstruction and loss of pancreatic parenchyma. A well-designed database is very important to address both the short-term and long-term outcomes after PD. Objective: The objective of this research was to build an international PD database implemented with security and clinical rule supporting functions, which made the data-sharing easier and improve the accuracy of data. Methods: The proposed system is a cloud-based application. To fulfill its requirements, the system comprises four subsystems: a data management subsystem, a clinical rule supporting subsystem, a short message notification subsystem, and an information security subsystem. After completing the surgery, the physicians input the data retrospectively, which are analyzed to study factors associated with post-PD common complications (delayed gastric emptying and pancreatic fistula) to validate the clinical value of this system. Results: Currently, this database contains data from nearly 500 subjects. Five medical centers in Taiwan and two cancer centers in Mongolia are participating in this study. A data mining model of the decision tree analysis showed that elderly patients (>76 years) with pylorus-preserving PD (PPPD) have higher proportion of delayed gastric emptying. About the pancreatic fistula, the data mining model of the decision tree analysis revealed that cases with non-pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) reconstruction - body mass index (BMI). >29.65 or PG reconstruction - BMI. >23.7 - non-classic PD have higher proportion of pancreatic fistula after PD. Conclusions: The proposed system allows medical staff to collect and store clinical data in a cloud, sharing the data with other physicians in a secure manner to achieve collaboration in research. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Clinical database; Cloud; Pancreaticoduodenectomy","Aged; Algorithms; Body Mass Index; Computer Systems; Data Collection; Databases, Factual; Gastric Emptying; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Medical Informatics; Mongolia; Pancreatic Fistula; Pancreaticoduodenectomy; Registries; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Taiwan; User-Computer Interface; Clouds; Data mining; Decision trees; Information management; Security of data; Clinical database; Cloud; Pancreaticoduodenectomy; Clinical database; Cloud-based applications; Collaborative database; Data mining models; Decision tree analysis; Gastric emptying; Long-term outcome; Pancreaticoduodenectomy; aged; article; body mass; cancer center; data mining; decision tree; human; information processing; Mongolia; pancreas fistula; pancreaticoduodenectomy; physician; stomach emptying; Taiwan; Database systems"

Cyberinsurance has been proposed as a promising solution to help firms optimize security spending. However, cyberinsurance is ineffective in addressing the investment inefficiency caused by risk interdependency. In this paper, we examine two alternative risk management approaches: risk pooling arrangements (RPAs) and managed security services (MSSs). We show that firms can use an RPA as a complement to cyberinsurance to address the overinvestment issue caused by negative externalities of security investments; however, the adoption of an RPA is not incentive-compatible for firms when the security investments generate positive externalities. We then show that the MSS provider serving multiple firms can internalize the externalities of security investments and mitigate the security investment inefficiency. As a result of risk interdependency, collective outsourcing arises as an equilibrium only when the total number of firms is small. © 2013 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

This has instigated a fundamental change in the whole education sector's structure, values, culture and the ways in which learning is conducted. The worldwide e-learning market has grown considerably, but failures are still occurring. While technology is the enabler of e-learning, in many institutions it is also an obstacle affecting the full utilization of its own potential. This paper investigates the major technical issues that impact on e-learning delivery in Saudi Arabian universities. The study identified four major technical issues: information communication technology (ICT) infrastructures, security, access (on-site and off-site) and information technology (IT) support. The various technical issues were investigated through the use of empirical case studies from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This research also presents several recommendations which could be enforced to aid the implementation of e-learning systems at universities in Saudi Arabia. This research therefore has relevance for researchers, educational leaders and developers. Finally, a number of possible further research directions are discussed. © 2005-2013 JATIT & LLS.

In Quantum-Key-Distribution and Quantum-Secret-Sharing over 1310/1550 nm fiber, two other important, defense and information security related, QI applications, it's crucial for the information transmission security to guarantee that the information carriers (photons) are single. Thus a PNRD can provide an additional security level against eavesdropping. Currently, there are at least a couple of promising PNRD technologies in the Near-Infrared, but all of them require cryogenic cooling. Thus a compact, portable PNRD, based on commercial Avalanche-Photo-Diodes (APDs), could be a very useful instrument for many QIexperiments. For an APD-based PNRD, it is crucial to measure the APD-current in the beginning of the avalanche. Thus an efficient cancellation of the APD capacitive spikes is a necessary condition for the very weak APD current measurement. The detector's principle is based on two commercial, pair-matched InGaAs/InP APDs, connected in series. It leads to a great cancelation of the capacitive spikes caused by the narrow (300 ps), differential gate-pulses of maximum 4V amplitude assuming that both pulses are perfectly matched in regards to their phases, amplitudes, and shapes. The cancellation scheme could be used for other APD-technologies, e.g. Silicon, extending the detection spectrum from visible to NIR. The design distinguishes itself from other, APD-based, schemes by its scalability feature and its computer controlled cancellation of the capacitive spikes. Furthermore, both APDs could be equally used for the detection purpose, which opens a possibility for the odd-even photon number parity detection. © 2013 SPIE.","Afterpulsing; APD capacitive spikes; Dark counts; InGaAs/InP avalanche photo diodes; Photon number parity detection; Photon Number Resolving Detection; Quantum efficiency; Single photon detectors","Detectors; Infrared devices; Light; Photons; Quantum efficiency; Quantum theory; Security of data; Afterpulsing; APD capacitive spikes; Dark counts; Parity detections; Photon number resolving; Single-photon detectors; Avalanche diodes"

This novel power analysis attacks take advantage of the dependence of the leakage power of CMOS integrated circuits on the data they process. With the development of integrated circuits technology, LPA attacks are becoming a serious threat to the information security of cryptographic circuits in sub-100-nm technologies. This paper proposes a LPA countermeasure circuit based on random ring oscillators, which efficiently resists the LPA attacks. The implementation of the critical S-Box of the advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm shows that using countermeasure of random ring oscillators can thwart LPA attack. Moreover, the countermeasure circuit can be mounted onto different symmetric algorithm which has S-Box architecture. Based on our approach, a LPA-resistant AES chip can be proposed to maintain the same throughput with less than 2K extra gates. Simulation results show the countermeasure proposed in this paper is a promising approach to implement a LPA-resistant crypto processor. © 2013 IEEE.","Block cipher; Crypto core; Dynamic power analysis; Leakage power analysis; S-Box","Algorithms; CMOS integrated circuits; Communication systems; Data privacy; Network security; Sensor networks; Block ciphers; Crypto core; Dynamic Power; Leakage power analysis; S-Box; Cryptography"

In a similar way, multisegmented MNs (m-MNs) can be obtained by alternating magnetic and nonmagnetic materials during the fabrication process. In both cases, nanocylinders result axially parallel and forming triangular arrays immerse themselves within the membrane used to produce them. Due to shape anisotropy, each magnetic segment presents its magnetization pointing along the cylinder axis either inward or outward of the membrane plane. The as-grown system presents no global magnetization. A strong enough localized magnetic field can revert the magnetization of small groups of neighboring m-MNs. This feature can be used to inscribe ferromagnetic patterns (FP) over either membrane surface to store fixed information (security codes or firmware). Here, we study the total energy per cylinder for the case of a disc shaped FP inscribed over a circular membrane containing a huge amount of m-MNs. To try to prevent spontaneous magnetization reversion due to thermal effects we test for m-MNs a stabilization mechanism proposed previously for homogeneous MNs: an opposite ferromagnetic band (OFB) inscribed inside the FP. We have compared inscription and stabilization of FP over arrays of homogenous and multisegmented MNs. © 1965-2012 IEEE.","Magnetic materials; Magnetic memories; Magnetic nanoparticles","Alumina; Cylinders (shapes); Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Firmware; Magnetic materials; Magnetic storage; Magnetization; Membranes; Stabilization; Circular membranes; Fabrication process; Magnetic memory; Magnetic nano-particles; Non-magnetic materials; Spontaneous magnetization; Stabilization mechanisms; Triangular arrays; Magnetic anisotropy"

Design/methodology/approach - The system incorporates text-dependant speaker verification via mobile devices that provides for a three-factor authentication scheme for granting authorised access to certain websites or applications. The same speech recognition engine used by Google Voice Search is utilised to provide voice-to-text feature. All verification tasks are performed on a centralised server to minimise computing requirements on mobile platforms where feature extractions is executed using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients. The resulting features are transmitted to the server instead of raw voice data to reduce network load. Actual voice verification takes place in the central server using Vector Quantisation. Findings - The initial results have indicated that VoxGrid is capable of providing an additional level of security on user authentications at a low cost and without using extra security tokens other than one's voice with a good enough performance given the limited resources available during testing. Originality/value - Past speaker verification experiments have been conducted but we see that this is the first time it is done on mobile devices with a client-server architecture using K-Means Clustering and Vector Quantisation.

Insider threat detection is known to be a difficult problem, presenting many research challenges. In this paper we report our effort on detecting malicious insiders from large amounts of work practice data. We propose novel approaches to detect two types of insider activities: (1) blend-in anomalies, where malicious insiders try to behave similar to a group they do not belong to, and (2) unusual change anomalies, where malicious insiders exhibit changes in their behavior that are dissimilar to their peers' behavioral changes. Our first contribution focuses on detecting blend-in malicious insiders. We propose a novel approach by examining various activity domains, and detecting behavioral inconsistencies across these domains. Our second contribution is a method for detecting insiders with unusual changes in behavior. The key strength of this proposed approach is that it avoids flagging common changes that can be mistakenly detected by typical temporal anomaly detection mechanisms. Our third contribution is a method that combines anomaly indicators from multiple sources of information. © 2013 IEEE.","anomaly detection; information fusion; Insider threat detection","Security of data; Anomaly detection; Behavioral changes; Insider threat detections; Malicious insiders; Multi domains; Multiple source; Research challenges; Work practices; Information fusion"

In this work, we present a novel technique for system protection that alleviates the need for a golden chip. We aim to decrease the ability of leaking sensitive information by infected IPs.

In this work we describe three lab exercises developed at the United States Naval Academy for use in our fundamentals of cyber-security course, a course required of all freshmen. The hands-on lab activities reinforce ideas presented in classroom discussions about basic network reconnaissance, attack, and defense. A class of approximately twenty students is divided into two teams. Each team's network has its own workstation, name server, and gateway router, and a webserver. Students each have an individual host machine on their own network. In the reconnaissance lab students attempt to discover the opponent network's topology, services and software, as well as guess account names and potential passwords. The information is then used in the succeeding attack lab, where denial of service attacks, injection attacks, and other remote exploits are conducted. During the defense lab, students harden their systems by managing accounts and passwords in both Unix and Windows systems, encrypting confidential files, defending against HTML injection attacks, configuring a firewall, shutting down unnecessary services, removing unnecessary software, and patching known vulnerabilities; all while maintaining a prescribed set of services. All three labs are conducted using virtual machines (VMs) in a virtual. Detailed instructor notes, lab instructions, student check sheets, grading sheets, and supporting software were developed for these labs. In this paper we discuss our experiences with these labs, assessment and evaluation material, and lessons learned. The insights that we have gained will prove useful to those thinking about implementing or refining labs in a cyber-security course, or perhaps even for other types of labs.

Different biometric signatures are encoded using individual orthogonal codes and then multiplexed together. The encrypted and multiplexed image is hidden inside a cover image employing a steganography technique, where one from the three least significant bits is chosen using another secret key. A color cover image is utilized which is decomposed into three color components, red, green and blue, so that three different sets of biometric signatures can be embedded into each of the color components. The color stego image is finally encrypted using multiple phase-shifted reference joint transform correlation (MRJTC) technique. The proposed encryption technique is a nonlinear process which increases the security strength significantly against any unauthorized access. The encoded steganography technique reduces the vulnerability that an intruder can retrieve any information from a given image through any steganalysis attack. Finally, the orthogonal coding scheme enhances the robustness by making the biometric information almost inaccessible without authorization. © 2013 SPIE.","Biometric signature; Color image processing; Joint transform correlation; Orthogonal coding; Steganography","Biometrics; Color; Color image processing; Cryptography; Data communication systems; Image processing; Multiplexing; Optical data processing; Signal encoding; Biometric informations; Biometric signatures; Confidential information; Joint transform correlation; Least significant bits; Orthogonal coding; Orthogonal coding scheme; Red , green and blues; Steganography"

Recruiting of cyber-security personnel is similarly focused on end-of-life expertise. By emphasizing cyber-security at these late stages, security problems are found and corrected when it is most expensive to do so, thus increasing the cost of owning and operating complex software systems. Worse, expenditures on expensive security measures often mean less money for innovative developments. These unwanted increases in cost and potential slowing of innovation are unavoidable consequences of an approach to security that finds and remediate faults after software has been implemented. We argue that software security can be improved and the total cost of a software system can be substantially reduced by an appropriate allocation of resources to the early stages of a software project. By adopting a similar allocation of R&D funds to the early stages of the software lifecycle, we propose that the costs of cyber-security can be better controlled and, consequently, the positive effects of this R&D on industry will be much more pronounced. © 2013 SPIE.","cyber-attack; Cyber-security; software lifecycle; software total cost","Computer crime; Computer software; Costs; Life cycle; Complex software systems; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Research and development; Security problems; Software life cycles; Software security; Software systems; Security of data"

Given the self-similar characteristics of online networks which are shown to have fractal and scale-free structure, we presume that the self-similar selection which is well developed in physics outperforms random or targeted vaccination based on incoming or outgoing connections. We examine the effectiveness of the proposed self-similar selection method with random vaccination and other different types of targeted vaccination strategies in terms of delaying the spread of computer virus over a scale-free computer network constructed using real-world World Wide Web data. Our computer simulation results indicate that the self-similar selection method is more effective in deterring virus propagation than the existing vaccination strategies. In addition, vaccination based on self-similar selection is practical since it does not require detailed information about network morphology at the individual node level, which is often not easy to observe. Our findings have significant implications for both policy makers and network security providers. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Information security; Network immunization; Self-similar selection; Virus propagation",""

An original image is encrypted by adding a cryptographic key for providing privacy and secrecy between the sender and receiver. Then the encrypted image is compressed in multistage, here it is two times compressed by the coefficients that are generated from Haar wavelet transform.

Information encryption has long been a method used for information security. With the rapid development of parallel computing capacities of computer hardware, this method alone could not be trusted to ensure security by increasing the key sizes, thus bringing in the information hiding techniques into the scenario. Cryptography scrambles the data to be secured while information hiding embeds the information into files which do not reveal the presence of information. Steganography and water marking are two information hiding techniques. While steganography is used for secretly embedding the sensitive information in files, watermarking is used to implement copyright protection. Steganographic techniques are being widely used these days to increase the security of information. A combination of cryptography and steganography results in very strong cryptosystems. This is a paper of unexampled prosperity, which elicits easy-to-implement, difficult-to-sense proficiency for image steganography enforcing the statistical distribution's profound laws. Bit length for embedding is adjudicated via some delineated conditions and is done so by making use of Least Significant Bit. These conditions are the index for increasing complexity as well as security. Experimental ensues in terms of BPP, embedding capacity, and stego outputs also vindicate this paper.

Since numerous systems contain a network of devices that communicate with each other (often times with commercial off the shelf [COTS] radios), an adversary is able to intercept messages between system devices, which jeopardizes sensitive information transmitted by the system (e.g. location of system devices). Secret key algorithms such as AES are a very common means to encrypt all system messages to a sufficient security level, for which lightweight implementations exist for even very resource constrained devices. However, all system devices must use the appropriate key to encrypt and decrypt messages from each other. While traditional public key algorithms (PKAs), such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), provide a sufficiently secure means to provide authentication and a means to exchange keys, these traditional PKAs are not suitable for very resource constrained embedded systems or systems which contain low reliability communication links (e.g. mesh networks), especially as the size of the network increases. Therefore, most UGS and other embedded systems resort to pre-placed keys (PPKs) or other naïve schemes which greatly reduce the security and effectiveness of the overall cryptographic approach.

Formally, intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be defined as ""software or hardware systems that automate the process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network, analyzing them for signs of security problems"" [1]. Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are those that attempt to actually stop an active attack or security problem. While there are many IDS and IPS products on the market today, often sold as self-contained, network attached computer appliances, truly effective intrusion detection and prevention is achieved when viewed as a process coupled with layers of appropriate technologies and products.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws conceptually upon an existing security standard's framework and omissions in information privacy compliance frameworks are recognized. As a result, an extended framework of information security and privacy standards is developed. Moreover, taking into account the different attributes and focus of information privacy as compared to information security, the elicitation of usability criteria for web applications and interfaces that will assist users to protect their privacy, is being proposed. Findings - Within ICT standards numerous information security standards exist, which enable a common understanding of security requirements and promote global rules and practices for security mechanisms. Through their usage, designed information systems ultimately reach a commonly accepted security level and interoperate with other systems in an efficient and secure way. Nevertheless, a similar compliance environment is missing with regard to information privacy. Often security controls are seen as the solution to privacy protection and security compliance frameworks are regarded as guidance to information privacy as well. This is clearly the wrong approach since the main security and privacy attributes are different; information security refers to information stored, processed and transmitted for completing the information system's functions and purpose, while information privacy is the protection of the information's subject identity. Research limitations/implications - The identified gaps in compliance environments are based on extensive literature review, while the proposed enhancements for the information privacy standards are, at this stage, an opinion-based piece of work. Originality/value - Currently, information privacy is treated mostly as a legal compliance requirement and thus is not adequately handled by security standards. The paper provides recommendations and further guidance in managerial, procedural and technical level for handling information privacy. Copyright © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

However, vulnerability identification errors - wrongly identified or unidentified vulnerabilities - can occur as uncertain data are used. Furthermore, businesses' security needs are not considered sufficiently. Hence, security functions may not protect business assets sufficiently and cost-effectively. This paper aims to resolve vulnerability errors by analysing the security requirements of information assets in business process models. Design/methodology/approach - Business process models have been selected for use, because there is a close relationship between business process objectives and risks. Security functions are evaluated in terms of the information flow of business processes regarding their security requirements. The claim that vulnerability errors can be resolved was validated by comparing the results of a current risk assessment approach with the proposed approach. The comparison is conducted both at three entities of an insurance company, as well as through a controlled experiment within a survey among security professionals. Findings - Vulnerability identification errors can be resolved by explicitly evaluating security requirements in the course of business; this is not considered in current assessment methods. Originality/value - It is shown that vulnerability identification errors occur in practice. With the explicit evaluation of security requirements, identification errors can be resolved. Risk assessment methods should consider the explicit evaluation of security requirements. Copyright © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The implications of the continuing boom in satellites are revolutionary for those who did not have access to secure encrypted data in remote locations around the world. This chapter discusses how encryption algorithms will play a key role in the next stage of development for advanced virtual satellite systems that promise to replace monolithic satellites with clusters of wirelessly-interconnectd satellite modules. In addition to satellite encryption use by commercial organizations and governments, this chapter presents the implementation of a secure encrypted wireless environment encompassing direct satellite communications and land-based communications links. An information assurance/cybersecurity architecture that supports the sharing of common resources across multiple payloads/users at multiple encryption levels is also covered. In addition, the following are also coverered: The role of satellite encryption technology trends with regards to the pace that the national cryptography policy must keep up with; the political environment; and, the significant changes in the post-Cold War environment that call attention to the need for and the impact a cryptography policy would have domestically and internationally. Furthermore, the book describes the instruments and goals of the current U.S. satellite encryption policy and some of the issues raised by current policy. In general, the chapter covers the development, implementation and management of advanced satellite encryption options and strategies that will forever change how organizations do business now and in the foreseeable future. Also, the chapter discusses the misuse of satellite encryption technology by the government; the international community; international and domestic terrorist organizations; and, domestic and international criminal organizations. The chapter further evaluates enlarging the space of possible satellite encryption policy options, and offers findings and recommendations. This chapter will leave little doubt that a new world infrastructure in the area of encrypted satellite communications is about to be constructed. The text will benefit organizations and governments, as well as their advanced citizens. For the disadvantaged regions of the world, however, advanced satellite encryption communications could be one of those rare technological events that enable traditional societies to leap ahead and long-dormant economies to flourish in security. © 2013 Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) focus primarily on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, attempting to stop them, and reporting them to security administrators. In addition, organizations use IPSs for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats, and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IPSs have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. IPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events, and produce reports. Many IPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attack's content. This chapter describes the characteristics of IPS technologies and provides recommendations for designing, implementing, configuring, securing, monitoring, and maintaining them. The types of IPS technologies are differentiated primarily by the types of events that they monitor and the ways in which they are deployed. © 2013 Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Images are no longer just memories or records of the past. Image steganography has made sure of this. With the growing need to secure our valuable information and data, the concept of information hihng was born. And from the day of its invention, it has evolved significantly. It has evolved from cryptography to watermarking for the copyright protection to Steganography. This study describes how the covert communication takes place effectively by means of Pixel Indicator (PI) and Pixel Value Differencing (PVD) for multi-user. The former is employed in the color cover image to separate it into three planes and any one plane indicating the data channel through its last two bits of its intensity values to entrench and the later introduces the variable bit embedhng in cover image. To increase the complexity, scrambling of secret data is introduced before embedhng itself. Steganalysis results proved that this method is more resistive to chi-square attack. The proposed methods performance is appraised by manipulating MSE and PSNR and the results are tabulated. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.","Cryptography; Data hihng; Information security; PI; PVD; Steganography",""

Having the ability to gauge and measure exposure within an environment effectively prepares the organization to proactively implement workflows and assessments. Defining security holes in an organization is the delineation of risk that may exist. It is necessary to architect a framework to analyze exclusive incidents, potential outcomes that may arise from such incidents, and the impending consequences. Managing vulnerability where a team can identify, classify, remediate, and mitigate potential situations is critical to keeping a business up and running. Additionally, tools can be utilized to identify and classify possible vulnerabilities. Information security needs to be in line with the business objectives, and decisions must be made based on metrics and indicators of vulnerabilities. Regularly combining assessments and audits offers executives a clear, prioritized, and comprehensive view of risks and vulnerabilities, while integrating IT assets, resources, environment and processes into a single platform. Just as IP addresses had to advance from IPv4 to IPv6, password lengths will have to increase, as will their complexity.

In addition, vulnerability assessment standardizes the three main steps of the assessment process: representing configuration information of systems for testing; analyzing the system for the presence of the specified machine state (vulnerability, configuration, patch state, etc.); and, reporting the results of the assessment.

For instance friend requests on Facebook are often accepted blindly, thus granting unknown people access to profile details. These problems fuel requirements for an application, developed in this study, that raises awareness of security issues in Facebook. Design/methodology/approach - The «Theory of Planned Behaviour» (TPB), a model from psychology to predict behaviour, is used as a theoretical foundation for the application. Attitudes, perceived behavioural control and social norms are the main variables of this model. Social norms can be massively affected by the Facebook friends and therefore an application is developed which uses this in order to raise awareness. Findings - The application propagated itself virally. Out of 117 users of the application, 15 took action to change the public-search option visibility from public to private. The use of the application took on average 10.5 minutes. Originality/value - Applications that scan a Facebook profile for fishy content already exist.

Of particular importance and interest in this vein is the way in which semiconductors and other electronic devices are increasingly deployed to support energy distribution, storage, and control at a variety of scales. Future smart grid supply chains must be secured to prevent cyber attacks from affecting energy infrastructure, and the societal and economic functions on which they depend. This perspective paper calls for a multiscale approach to address modeling and decision-making for energy system hardware supply chains. A multiscale approach, as discussed in this paper, can facilitate resilience of supply chains across the life cycles of these systems, through low- and high-tech techniques to monitor and act on the supply chain. This can incorporate both qualitative and quantitative factors to suit the variety of stakeholders, geographic scales, organizational levels, and planning and operational time horizons. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Counterfeiting; Energy systems; Multiscale; Resilience; Risk; Smart grid; Supply chain; Sustainability","energy; energy resource; hardware; resilience; software; sustainability"

Confidentiality is the most important point of information security with respect to integrity and availability in cloud computing especially in financial, governmental and military usage. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) service increases the cloud's security level. In this paper, a hybrid approach is introduced that can be used in cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers or untrusted employees in a circular chain protection model. This model is proposed over an existing model, AdjointVM, which uses three types of technologies (trusted computing, host-based IDS, virtual machine monitor based IDS) to tackle external and internal threats in cloud systems. The proposed model claims to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, and aims to build a more secure cloud environment for the users by adding additional security mechanism between VMs. In the proposed model, responsibility of confidentiality is not giving up only to the providers or cloud administrators, a VM can protect another VM in a circular manner and this results a chain structure and constructs a circular structure to enhance global security of the system. At the same time, users can also manage and monitor their own confidentiality by themselves. © 2013 IEEE.","AdjointVM; cloud computing; intrusion detection; security; trusted computing; virtual machine","Cloud computing; Electrical engineering; Intrusion detection; AdjointVM; Circular structures; Cloud environments; Intrusion Detection Systems; security; Trusted computing; Virtual machine monitors; Virtual machines; Chains"

In our model, we specifically consider how the vulnerability of information and the potential loss from such vulnerability affects the optimal amount of resources that should be devoted to securing that information.

Here, we propose a novel image encryption algorithm which has the efficacy of encrypting eight distinct plain-images simultaneously. Low frequency components of plain-images are selected and processed. The algorithm makes use of three chaotic systems to get visual effect of disorder, distorted and indistinguishable single encrypted image. The encryption/decryption processing operations such as chaos-based circular rotation and random mixing of pixels are carried out in wavelet domains. The one-dimensional chaotic maps are used to generate two chaotic key images needed for circular rotation. A two-dimensional chaotic map is employed for randomly shuffling the coefficients matrix received after mixing. The performance of proposed algorithm is analyzed through experimentation against pixels correlation, peak signal to noise ratio, key sensitivity and key space.

While the new type of anonymous, invisible and devastating security threats (malware, worms and viruses) shape contemporary warfare, organizations are challenged by the undefined risks of open source dual-use security tools. The dual-use dilemma is very important. It has not received adequate academic focus: questions such as increased or decreased risk, facilitation of security breaches, and the impact on security awareness have not been clarified or studied. This research closes existing gaps by studying the open source dual-use security software challenges that organizations should consider when using this technology. We utilize a triangulation approach with three independent data sources to conduct a detailed analysis of this phenomenon. Our study has found that the dual-use technology has both positive and negative effects on information system security. The ease of use of the dual-use security software facilitates security breaches and enterprises are using vulnerable open source security libraries and frameworks to develop their own in-house applications. On a positive note, open source dual-use security software is used as a powerful defense tool against attackers. Our study also found that security awareness is the key to maintaining the right level of information security risk in the dual-use context.

In public cloud environment, the client moves its data to public cloud server (PCS) and cannot control its remote data. Thus, information security is an important problem in public cloud storage, such as data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In some cases, the client has no ability to check its remote data possession, such as the client is in prison because of committing crime, on the ocean-going vessel, in the battlefield because of the war, and so on. It has to delegate the remote data possession checking task to some proxy. In this paper, we study proxy provable data possession (PPDP). In public clouds, PPDP is a matter of crucial importance when the client cannot perform the remote data possession checking. We study the PPDP system model, the security model, and the design method.

A work in progress, it is intended to be a relatively easy-to-use set of guidelines useful not only for those just beginning to think about preserving their digital assets, but also for institutions planning the next steps in enhancing their existing digital preservation systems and workflows. It allows institutions to assess the level of preservation achieved for specific materials in their custody. It is not designed to assess the robustness of digital preservation programs as a whole since it does not cover such things as policies, staffing, or organizational support. The guidelines are organized into five functional areas that are at the heart of digital preservation systems: storage and geographic location, file fixity and data integrity, information security, metadata, and file formats. This paper presents the Levels, explains the context of the project's development within the NDSA, describes the rationale behind each of the guidelines and why they were prioritized the way they were, suggests how the guidelines may be used, and compares and contrasts the Levels to other ways of assessing stages of digital preservation.

These usually are addressing the customers (external or internal), compliance with standards (effectiveness) waste reduction and better use of resources (efficiency) for continual improvement. Such systems are designed according to the requirements of the standards for quality management, software engineering and information security. Quality systems themselves could not provide all necessary means for driving the organization to the quality and excellence of a product. Still there are some gaps in the processes which are not covered by too generic standards and it is the organizational ability to cover the gaps in an appropriate way. The aim of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of our proposed conceptual QSPS model to reduce the gaps in the processes of an organization by enhancing the quality of production software. In order to achieve that goal, a mathematical representation of QSPS has been derived and an evaluation has been realized among different software quality methods. The reliability and validity of the QSPS has been examined through the practical application to the automotive industry considering the elements like: (i) Planning, time and cost evaluation (ii) Software requirements (management, risk, quality and security) (iii) Validation and verification of the implemented software before release (iv) Internal release of the software (v) Client release of the software (vi) Functional monitoring after release in the production and continuous improvement process (vii) Customer satisfaction. The results of mathematical simulation and practical application revealed that the proposed QSPS model showed superior phenomena compared with other known software quality methods and also expressed significant advantages, while using it on the production software. So, an effective application of QSPS would result in the smooth running of the production software to get a high quality product according to customer and standard requirements. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.","production software; QSPS; software efficiency; software quality system",""

The risk of not sharing information among organizations compared to the benefit of sharing information can be considered in an ""information sharing risk-benefit analysis"" to prevent a terrorism incident from occurring and to build a rapid response capability. In the EU project AniBioThreat, early warning is the main topic in work package 3 (WP 3). A strategy has been generated based on an iterative approach to bring law enforcement agencies and human and animal health institutes together. Workshops and exercises have taken place during the first half of the project, and spin-off activities include new preparedness plans for institutes and the formation of a legal adviser network for decision making. In addition, a seminar on actionable knowledge was held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2012, which identified the need to bring various agency cultures together to work on developing a resilient capability to identify early signs of bio-And agroterrorism threats. The seminar concluded that there are a number of challenges in building a collaborative culture, including developing an education program that supports collaboration and shared situational awareness. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Agriculture; Bioterrorism; Cooperative Behavior; Decision Making; Humans; Information Dissemination; Knowledge; Law Enforcement; Public Health; Sentinel Surveillance; agriculture; animal disease; article; biological warfare; cooperation; decision making; human; information dissemination; knowledge; law enforcement; public health; sentinel surveillance"

It is important to know what potential participants understand about the risks and benefits of providing samples in order to ensure adequate informed consent. Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) is currently planning a biobank where adult members would be asked to contribute an additional tube of blood during a routine blood draw. Adult KPCO members in clinic waiting rooms were asked to read an informational brochure and informed consent form. Respondents then completed a survey to evaluate their understanding of the materials, willingness to provide a blood sample to a biobank, and facilitators and barriers to participation. Two hundred three members participated in the survey, of whom 69 % indicated willingness to contribute to a biobank. Nearly all understood that they would not be paid for any products resulting from the use of their blood and would not receive results from their samples (91 and 84 %, respectively). Seventy-four percent would donate a sample because, ""it is important to contribute to research,"" and over half the participants (56 %) said they had no concerns about contributing to a biobank. Of those with concerns, 35%said information security was a reason. In multivariate models, older age and trust in KPCO were significant predictors of willingness to participate (p=0.03 and p<0.0001, respectively).

The literature to date (40 texts), which was reviewed for this article, emphasises individual techniques in its description of SE. This leads to a very scattered, anecdotal, and vague notion of SE. In addition, due to the lack of analytical concepts, research conducted on SE encounters difficulties in explaining the success of SE. In such explanations, the victim's psychological traits are overemphasised, although this kind of explanation can cover only a small portion of SE cases. In this article, we have sought to elaborate the concept of SE through analysis of the functions of different techniques. In this way, we have been able to extrapolate three dimensions of SE: persuasion, fabrication, and data gathering. By utilising these dimensions, SE can be grasped in all its aspects instead of through individual techniques. Furthermore, research can benefit from our multidimensional approach as each of the dimensions pertains to a different theory. Therefore, the victim's personal traits cannot function as the only explanation. All in all, the analysis, understanding, and explanation of the success of SE can be furthered using our new approach. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","data gathering; fabrication; information security; intrusion; persuasion; social engineering","Fabrication; Information technology; Social sciences; Data gathering; intrusion; Multi-dimensional approach; New approaches; Personal traits; persuasion; Social engineering; Three dimensions; Security of data"

In SS technique, a signal (having a specific bandwidth) is spread in the frequency domain and results in a signal having wider bandwidth. Remember, the new resulting bandwidth of a signal is much larger than the minimum required frequency spectrum. In Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum, i.e., DSSS (one of the common techniques of SS) the transmitting information signal is multiplied or combined with the spreading signal (usually Barker code) of wider bandwidth and results in a modulation signal that take up the wide bandwidth of the spreading signal. This new consequential signal is then combined with a carrier signal before transmission. The most important advantage of DSSS technology is the accepted transmission security. In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed that helps out the traditional DSSS system to enhance the transmission security by using random selection of multiple spreading codes in DSSS.

However it has been recently cited that VoIP is one of the greatest new risks to business. This risk is cited to increase Information Security insurance premiums in the near future. Due to the dynamic nature of the technology, regulatory and legislative concerns such as lawful interception of communications and privacy may also contribute to business risk. VoIP consists of both direct communications (voice conversation) and indirect communications (voice mails, emails and instant messaging). Due to this dual nature, complying with regulations such as the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act (RICA) should be considered. In order to leverage value from the VoIP implementation, an executive or SME owner should look to implement the technology with knowledge of the potential risk of civil liability. This is further highlighted by the King III Report which makes the Directors and CEO of an organisation ultimately responsible for IT Governance and Information Security Governance. The report goes further to say, any new technology, such as VoIP, should comply with all South African legislation and regulations. This responsibility encourages the practice of both due care and due diligence. However, recent trends exercised by Information Security professionals, responsible for drafting Information Security policies, often neglect the regulatory requirements and choose to only implement international best practices with no considerations to the risk of civil liability. Although these best practice frameworks may inadvertently comply with existing local legislation, a chance of an oversight is a possibility. Oversights may not only result in criminal sanctions but also civil action due to losses or damages suffered by a third party. Using both the identified regulations and relevant international best practices one may attempt to ensure good Governance with regards to VoIP's dual nature. The aim is to aid executives and SME owners in mitigating the risk of civil liability to better leverage VoIP's value by utilizing the proposed VoIP: Civil Liability Risk Table. This should aid in the exercise of due care and due diligence when implementing VoIP as a means of conducting business communication.","",""

Often signatures are constructed to identify such phenomena using either distributions or frequencies of attributes, or specific subsequences that are known to correlate to the phenomena. Distribution-based identification does not capture the essence of the sequence of behaviors and therefore may suffer from lack of specificity. At the other extreme, using specific subsequences to identify target phenomena is often too specific and suffers from lower sensitivity when natural variations arise in the phenomena, measuring process, or data analysis. We introduce here a method for discovering signatures for phenomena that are well characterized by sequences of event primitives. In this paper, we describe the steps taken and lessons learned in generalizing a sequence analysis method, BLAST, for use on non-biological datasets including expressing and operating on alphabets of varying length, constructing a reward/penalty model for arbitrary datasets, and discovering low complexity segments in sequence data by extending BLAST's native low-complexity estimating algorithms. We also present high-level overviews of several case studies that demonstrate the utility of this method to discovering signatures in a wide array of applications including network traffic, software analysis, server characterization, and others. Finally, we demonstrate how signatures discovered using this method can be expressed using a variety of model formalisms, each having its own relative benefit. © 2013 IEEE.","alignment; cybersecurity; sequence analysis; signature","Alignment; Application programs; Information science; Sensitivity analysis; Bio-inspired methods; Cyber security; Modeling formalisms; Natural variation; Network traffic; Sequence analysis; signature; Software analysis; Network security"

Although the number of security vulnerabilities grows every day, not the same thing can be said about the number of defense methods. But the most delicate problem in the information security domain remains detecting unknown attacks known as zero-day attacks. This paper presents methods for isolating the malicious traffic by using a honeypot system and analyzing it in order to automatically generate attack signatures for the Snort intrusion detection/pre- vention system. The honeypot is deployed as a virtual machine and its job is to log as much information as it can about the attacks. Then, using a protected machine, the logs are collected remotely, through a safe connection, for analysis. The challenge is to mitigate the risk we are exposed to and at the same time search for unknown attacks. © 2013 IEEE.","honeypot; intrusion detec- tion/prevention system; zero-day attacks","Computer science; Computer worms; Network security; Attack signature; Honeypots; intrusion detec- tion/prevention system; Malicious traffic; Security vulnerabilities; Unknown attacks; Virtual machines; Zero day attack; Control systems"

We concentrate on Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) public-key vulnerabilities which result from the initial settings of web servers. We look at the question of breaking individual RSA keys. The possibility of factoring RSA keys used by real web servers on the Internet has been a disturbing discovery which has received a lot of press in the recent months. We have conducted an Internet scan with a particular focus on commercial websites (.com and.co domains). We have created a database containing over 3 million certificate chains together with detailed information about each website, its security settings, geographic location and other relevant data. This allowed us to see how different key sizes are adopted, how many servers are using weak keys and which countries are quicker to adopt secure keys. We attempted to factor all keys we were able to collect from our scan and from another public database. The method to achieve this seemed trivial at first, but it can only be done efficiently by using a special algorithm proposed by Bernstein. We ran the computation based on an open implementation of Bernstein's algorithm. We have been able to factor few thousands keys. The infected servers we inspected appear as Embedded Web Servers (EWS). Although we have not yet found any immediate threats to e-commerce websites, the risks that such vulnerable servers present should not be underestimated as they can be exploited to perform different types of attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), corporate espionage and firmware modification. © 2013 IEEE.","cryptography; encryption; information security; public key","Algorithms; Cryptography; Firmware; Internet; Internet protocols; Security of data; Web services; Websites; Commercial websites; E-commerce websites; Embedded Web servers; Geographic location; Open implementation; Public keys; Rivest-shamir-adleman; Secure socket layers; Information technology"

In this paper, a novel algorithm for detecting smoothing filtering in digital images is proposed based on the frequency residual. The suspected image is re-filtered with a Gaussian low-pass filter, and the difference between the initial image and the re-filtered image in Fourier domain is called the frequency residual. Then, the frequency residual is projected into the Radon space with an adaptation of Radon transform. The obtained data is modeled as Fourier series and the model parameters are adopted as features for filtering detection. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can not only detect three typical smoothing spatial filters, including Gaussian filter, average filter, and median filter, but also can predict parameters of these filters to complement the existing state-of-the-art methods.","Digital image forensics; Radon transform; Smoothing filtering","Algorithms; Fourier series; Mathematical transformations; Security of data; Blind image forensics; Digital image forensics; Image authentication; Model parameters; Pre-registration; Radon Transform; Smoothing filtering; State-of-the-art methods; Image processing"

In order to enhance the quality of information security risk assessment, we proposed a modified version of wavelet neural network which can effectively combine all influencing factors in assessing information security risk by linear integrating several weights. Furthermore, the proposed wavelet neural network is trained by the BP algorithm with batch mode, and the weight coefficients of the wavelet are modified with the adopting mode.

Therefore, the security is becoming an increasing concern at both physical and information levels. Access controls are one of the most important aspects of information security. Role-based access control (RBAC) model is widely used in complex systems that are characterized by many participants. However, the existing models are not suitable for critical infrastructure systems with specialized features, such as a high number of devices dispersed over the vast geographical regions in 'an Internet-like distributed environment'. In this paper, access control mechanism optimized for Smart Grid systems is developed considering the regional division and concept of areas of responsibility (AOR).

Advanced computing technologies, ubiquitous environments, and sophisticated networks enable globally distributed access to data and information repositories to an uncountable community of consumers. Engineering security into these systems is more challenging and sophisticated than ever before. Along with this, assuring the integrity of highly networked systems requires economic decisions in rapidly changing technology and threat environments. Recognizing that countermeasures effective against cyber intrusions today can be ineffective tomorrow, the systems engineering community needs a rapid and agile way to identify the efficacies of competing countermeasure investment decisions. This paper presents a macroanalytic method for measuring economic-benefit returns on investments in cybersecurity. The method is called the Table Top Approach. The table top approach is designed to place light demands on the granularity of inputs to evaluate the impacts of cyber intrusion events and the benefits of countermeasure investments. The table top approach derives which investments in a set of competing choices offer the greatest cost-benefit gains in cyber defense, and why. It finds sets of Pareto efficient cost-benefit investments, and their economic returns, that capture tangible and intangible advantages of countermeasures that strengthen cybersecurity. ©2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To start a cybersecurity project, genuine buy-in and long-term support and commitment from management is essential. DuPont is organizing security teams, updating security policies for more than 100 manufacturing sites over the next two or three years, and developing cybersecurity best practices and policies at each site, which can eventually be shared and applied as universal, internal standards. These can include secure log-in procedures, multilayered network architectures with firewalls, physical security for control rooms, enhanced intrusion detection, and using antivirus software combined with whitelisting. Nessus plugins and Metasploit modules have been publicly released, enabling anyone to find and exploit vulnerabilities in six different embedded industrial process control devices.","","Computer system firewalls; Intrusion detection; Network architecture; Antivirus softwares; Industrial process control; Internal communications; Internal standards; Manufacturing sites; Network segmentation; Physical security; Security policy; Computer viruses"

Trust is highly influenced on information gathered from different sources, like newspaper or scientific reports on the security or vulnerability of computer systems. Assuming text-mining and incident documentation facilities available that provide us with news relevant to a given system, we show how to compile this experience into a stochastic model of trust. In particular, our models admits efficient analysis towards forecasting of possible future issues and the determination of worst-case scenarios for a given security system. We empirically evaluate the sensitivity of the our trust measure based on simulations using a prototype implementation, which closely matches the natural way in which trust is established: it takes a considerably larger lot of positive incidents to outweigh a negative experience. Our model indeed confirms such imbalance. Moreover, as more and more information is going into the trust model, a change of trust in either direction requires an amount of positive or negative experience that almost equals the so-far recorded history. We believe that these effects make the trust model a reasonable choice to resemble the human valuation of trust, while being funded on statistical grounds to be compatible with quantitative or qualitative enterprise risk management. © 2013 IEEE.","bayesian learning; information security; IT incident management; knowledge management; risk forecasting; risk management; security management; system security; trust modelling","Forecasting; Knowledge management; Network security; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Security systems; Bayesian learning; It incident managements; Risk forecasting; Security management; System security; Trust Modelling; Information technology"

Indeed, most security policies and procedures are highly technologically inclined, making use of hardware and software to protect and safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. Unfortunately, these tactics have achieved limited success because of inattention to the opportunistic aspects of crime commission.

Our methods do not require direct access to the target assets or privileged knowledge about the assets, resulting in a more efficient, scalable and privacy-preserving approach compared with existing data security solutions relying on data content classification. Instead, we rely on external information such as the attributes of the users, their access patterns and other published data content by the users.

Specifically, we implement the required encryption and authentication mechanisms entirely in software and as well exploit the hardware ciphers that are made available by our IoT platform. Moreover, we present quantitative results on the memory footprint, the execution time and the energy consumption of selected implementation modes and discuss some relevant tradeoffs. As expected, we find that hardware-based implementations are not only much faster, leading to latencies shorter than two orders of magnitude compared to software-based security suites, but also provide substantial savings in terms of ROM memory occupation, i.e. up to six times, and energy consumption. Furthermore, the addition of hardware-based security support at the link layer only marginally impacts the network lifetime metric, leading to worst-case reductions of just 2% compared to the case where no security is employed. This is due to the fact that energy consumption is dominated by other factors, including the transmission and reception of data packets and the control traffic that is required to maintain the network structures for routing and data collection. On the other hand, entirely software-based implementations are to be avoided as the network lifetime reduction in this case can be as high as 25%. © 2013 IEEE.","AES-CCM; Data link layer security; Information security; Internet of things; M2M communication; Performance analysis","Authentication; Hardware; Mobile computing; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; AES-CCM; Data link layer; Internet of Things (IOT); M2m communications; Performance analysis; Energy utilization"

In particular how online digital behaviors, particularly from young people entering the workplace for the first time, might impact on the work setting and how risk management might mitigate impact on the employee and organization. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed methods approach was used to consider these implications and draws from a number of data sources in the United Kingdom including a database of self-review data around online safety policy and practice from over 2000 schools, a survey of over 1000 14-16 year olds and their attitudes toward sexting, and a survey of over 500 undergraduate students. In addition the work considers existing risk management approaches and the models therein and how they might be applied to people risk. Findings - The dataset analyzed in this exploration show an education system in the United Kingdom that is not adequately preparing young people with an awareness of the implications of digital behavior in their lives and the survey data shows distorted social norms that might have serious consequences in the workplace. Practical implications - This research should raise concerns for managers in the workplace who need to be aware of the changes in ""normal"" behavior and how these potentially harmful practices may be mitigated in the workplace. Originality/value - The research provides a strong evidence base for a change in ""acceptable"" social behavior by children and young people alongside an education system not promoting effective awareness. These two datasets combined highlight potential new risks to the workplace.

In this study, a series of interviews was conducted with IT managers from a number of Swedish municipalities which shows a need for more support for municipalities trying to write and improve their SLAs. Based on a number of SLAs collected, this study proposes a specific SLA template for municipal IT management that focuses especially on information security issues.

The most computationally intensive components in the Gentry-Halevi FHE primitives are the large-number modular multiplications and additions.

Collections of documents, images, videos, and networks are being thought of not merely as bit strings to be stored, indexed, and retrieved, but as potential sources of discovery and knowledge, requiring sophisticated analysis techniques that go far beyond classical indexing and keyword counting, aiming to find relational and semantic interpretations of the phenomena underlying the data. Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis examines the frontier of analyzing massive amounts of data, whether in a static database or streaming through a system. Data at that scale--terabytes and petabytes--is increasingly common in science (e.g., particle physics, remote sensing, genomics), Internet commerce, business analytics, national security, communications, and elsewhere. The tools that work to infer knowledge from data at smaller scales do not necessarily work, or work well, at such massive scale. New tools, skills, and approaches are necessary, and this report identifies many of them, plus promising research directions to explore. Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis discusses pitfalls in trying to infer knowledge from massive data, and it characterizes seven major classes of computation that are common in the analysis of massive data. Overall, this report illustrates the cross-disciplinary knowledge--from computer science, statistics, machine learning, and application disciplines--that must be brought to bear to make useful inferences from massive data. © 2013 by the National Academy of Sciences.

This trend leads to major risk issues because the viewpoint of those designing and developing security-critical information (or computational or business) systems differs markedly from how those creating safety-critical control systems consider hazards and resulting risk. Essentially, information security has to do with protecting information assets, such as intellectual property and sensitive personal information, from falling into the hands of those bent on fraud and other nefarious activities. On the other hand, the focus of those responsible for the safety of software-intensive systems are intent on ensuring that a system malfunction or failure will not lead to harm to human beings or the environment. By combining security-critical information systems and safety-critical control systems, we have been creating a risk environment for these computer systems that is greater than the sum of the risk of the parts. For example, industrial control systems traditionally have been isolated from public networks and therefore not subject to cyber attacks over the Internet. As a consequence, such systems as these were never designed to withstand such remote attacks and are generally more vulnerable than information systems. On the other hand, those responsible for security-critical software systems would typically not consider physical harm resulting from successful attacks and believed that the worst that might happen would be financial losses. In the new cyber-physical systems world, designers and developers have to be concerned about the possibility of their systems being used as a conduit to controlling systems that have national security and critical infrastructure ramifications. In this paper we look at the totality of risks across a broad range of cyber-physical systems in the public and private sectors and point to areas that must be subjected to much greater scrutiny in order to mitigate increased risks. Since the risk is greater than the sum of the parts, so the mitigating activities must be that much greater to the extent that any security/safety approach needs to account for the risks of not only the individual components but also of the interactions among the components. This might well facilitate the justification of much greater expenditures and effort on securing the overall system since the consequences of successful breaches is that much greater. We present a model that helps to determine the factors that lead to levels of combined risk and will propose appropriate methods to suitably contain and minimize such risk. © 2013 IEEE.","cyber-physical systems; exploits; hazards; risk; threats; vulnerabilities","Control systems; Crime; Embedded systems; Hazards; Information systems; Losses; Network security; Risks; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); exploits; Industrial control systems; Public and private sector; Safety-critical control systems; Software intensive systems; threats; vulnerabilities; Public risks"

This need has been motivated by the emergence of a number of wireless services which require the channel to provide very low bit error rates (BER) along with information security. As more and more information is transacted over wireless media, there has been increasing criminal activity directed against such systems. This paper investigates the feasibility of using chaotic communications over Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels. We have studied the performance of differential chaos shift keying (DCSK) with 2×2 Alamouti scheme and 2×1 Alamouti scheme for different chaotic maps over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and channels disturbed by Rayleigh fading. Both the inherently wideband DCSK modulation and the space-time block code (STBC) are techniques that can mitigate the effect of multipath fading. The use of these schemes allows us to enhance security without degrading the BER performance for Rayleigh fading channels. We have employed an exact method to analyze the performances of DCSK communication system over fading channel. Our simulations indicate that the combination of the STC and tent map provides the best BER performance in addition to security when compared to the choice of other maps. Hence, this study shows that the use of these schemes can allow the user to enhance security without degrading the BER performance while communicating over these channels. © 2013 Allerton Press, Inc.","","Chaotic systems; Fading channels; Rayleigh fading; Security of data; Space-time block coding (STBC); White noise; Additive White Gaussian noise; Chaotic communications; Criminal activities; Differential chaos shift keying; Multiple-input multiple-output channels; Secure communications; Secure wireless communication; Space-Time Block Code(STBC); Communication systems"

Perhaps the most striking feature of IA is that everyone has a different opinion about what it actually is. The literature analysis enables us to distinguish three different approaches to Information Assurance: 1) Technical approach, concentrated on protection of networks; 2) Business approach, where IA is perceived as the comprehensive and systematic management of Information Security (InfoSec); 3) General approach, where IA is considered as a way to establish a level of confidence in information. Interviews with InfoSec practitioners reveal that they interpret the term IA differently and have contradictory views on how IA relates to InfoSec. It was felt that a survey with a greater number of practitioners might help to identify a commonly accepted perception of IA and to clarify the goals of the discipline. In 2011, a survey was conducted among one hundred InfoSec and IA professionals across the world. This chapter presents the results of the survey. © 2014 by IGI Global.

It addresses conflict of interest, and was first articulated in the well-cited work of Brewer and Nash, which proposes also an enforcement mechanism for the policy. Work subsequent to theirs has observed that their enforcement mechanism is overly restrictive - authorization states in which the policy is not violated may be rendered unreachable. We present two sets of novel results in this context. In one, we present an enforcement mechanism for the policy that is simple and efficient, and least-restrictive - an authorization state is reachable if and only if it does not violate the policy. In our enforcement mechanism, the actions of a subject can constrain the prospective actions of another, a trade-off that we show every enforcement mechanism that is least-restrictive must incur. Our other set of results is that the enforcement mechanism of Brewer-Nash is even more restrictive than previous work establishes. Specifically, we show: (1) what is called the *- rule is over-specified in that one of its sub-rules implies the other, and, (2) if a subject is authorized to write to an object that contains confidential information, then all objects that contain confidential information must belong to the same conflict of interest class. Our work sheds new light on what is generally considered to be important work in information security.

However, current literature on several areas of technology-enhanced learning environments, such as online information security (InfoSec) laboratories still lack well-specified pedagogical approaches and concrete design principles. In information security education, hands-on lab exercises play a major role in learning. Distance education brings in new challenges as the hands-on exercises require now virtual labs, which need to be accessible anywhere and often also anytime. This creates technological and pedagogical challenges, which are not fully understood in terms of explicit design principles that would enhance implementation and use of on-line educational labs. To contribute to this knowledge gap the paper describes five initial design principles: contextualization, collaboration, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and scalability. The principles are based on a literature review, contextual interviews and observations at a European University. The initial concretization of the principles adopts the pedagogical approach of Personalized System of Instruction (PSI), which is deemed to represent a good fit to the contextual goals for developing on-line security labs in the context of the target university. Further research for actual design of virtual InfoSec labs, adopting the action design-based research tradition to develop learning environments, is needed in order to concretize, to test and to elaborate these design principles. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Design Principles; Design Science Research (DSR); E-learning platform; Online Information Security Lab","Computer aided instruction; Design; Education; Laboratories; Research; Security of data; Design Principles; Design science researches (DSR); E-learning platforms; Information security education; Learning environments; Online Information Security Lab; Personalized system of instructions; Technology enhanced learning; E-learning"

With the help of public cloud, such as Google Docs, the SMBs are able to share their business information in lower cost but higher efficiency. Integrity between local storages and the clouds is a critical issue which often messes up the SMBs' digital assets in a hybrid environment. The downside makes SMBs reluctant to embrace cloud technology, though they may benefit from it in the long-term. The drawback comes from two aspects: 'the information chaos' and 'the management crisis'. The chaos originates from the possibility of information inconsistency among replicas in different places. On the other hand, the managerial crisis lies in the non-trustable access to the digital assets. Our research refers to the de facto open standards, viz. OpenID and O'Auth, to solve the problem by identity authentication and access right authorization on the hybrid cloud. The mechanisms are implemented for the Linux-based local host as well as MS-Windows-based computers, a private cloud constructed with Hadoop, and the Google Apps as a public cloud scenario. Users can launch the login from whatever a local host and then have Google Apps, Facebook and Twitter deal with access right permissions on the respective clouds.

A novel approach for encrypting digital images using Matrix Reordering (MR), a kind of scanning, and simple XOR operation is proposed in this paper. The MR is applied to permute the pixel positions and the XOR operation is done to diffuse the pixel values. The bitwise XOR operation is performed using pseudorandom numbers generated by the linear congruential method. The image encryption algorithm evaluation parameters such as histogram, correlation, cut test, dispersion test, visual testing, and speed test have been conducted using the suggested method, and the results are analyzed. The analysis shows that the proposed system is resistant to statistical and differential attacks, and could be used in real-time applications to provide confidentiality service for images with less computational overhead.","Differential attack; Image correlation; Image encryption; Image histogram; Information security; Matrix reordering; Scan pattern",""

Findings: The paper finds that the lack of an officially adopted definition for internet security in the UNGA discussions led to agreement solely on informative, best practice sharing or voluntary activities addressing other states, rather than providing an integrated vision for protecting the cyberspace. Research limitations/implications: The analysis is limited to the negotiations taking place in one institutional venue, namely the UNGA between 1998 and 2011, complemented by three resolutions issued by the ITU in 2010; activities conducted in other institutional venues might influence or determine the overall discourse noted in the resolutions under investigation here.

However, this evolution is also offering more rewards to potential attackers as well as a wider range of potential attack vectors due to the increase in the use of communications and the integration of operational systems in the internet. This has led to an increased awareness of the need for implementation of Cybersecurity measures in the Smart Grid. Cybersecurity field has not been part of the body of knowledge of electrical grid designers, though. So, even if equipment manufacturers are beginning to deal with the inclusion of CyberSecurity features to their developments, they are not always following the best approach but trying to find and follow recommendations and best practices guides. However, there are no fixed rules that ensure the security of equipment yet. The main aim of this paper is to use a pragmatic approach to create a reference guide for a first approach of equipment manufacturers to the world of cybersecurity. To achieve this, it is necessary to analyze very different aspects ranging from the work of public agencies such as NERC CIP or penetration testing techniques (such as those made by Digital Bond in S4), to international standards (IEC62351…), key management procedures. All of this should also be combined with the study of known Cybersecurity attacks such as Stuxnet. This paper takes into account that the implementation of Cybersecurity is a quite different task compared with the ones usually tackled by manufacturers. On one hand, it must be considered that it is not a concrete and definite task, but a set of decision making and measurement implementation rules relatively unconnected to one another. However, they help in the prevention of a whole range of risks for equipment. On the other hand, and, unlike what happens with other features, the implementation of security measures does not 100% guarantee the security of equipment, so the task does never end, and in addition to the prevention methods, detection methods should also be implemented to offer quick detection of new vulnerabilities. The combination of prevention and detection will sometimes fail, so a good Cybersecurity system must also consider mitigation and recovery techniques. This paper proposes as a practical approach the decomposition of the system in use cases as concise and clear as possible. The different steps proposed for use cases are as follows: • Initial analysis based on abstract concepts such as confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA model). • Analysis of risks and vulnerabilities, focusing primarily on scaled potential attacks. • Selection of generic methodologies for prevention, detection and response. • Selection of the security features both hardware (chip key storage, cryptographic coprocessors, biometric protection ...) and software (security libraries, logs and event managers ...). Tracking a top-down methodology for writing use cases, favours Cybersecurity non based on “magic formulas”, but on common sense. © 2013 Central Board of Irrigation and Power.

Hiding capacity is very much important for efficient covert communication. The redundancies of digital media as well as the characteristic of human visual system make hiding technology a significant one. Steganography is the Art and Science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient suspects the existence of the message. Images are the mostly cover objects used for information hiding schemes. Image steganography is the most popular method for message concealment. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the common, because of their frequency in the Internet.

While it may seem obvious that their role is to define and deliver organisational security goals, there has been little discussion on what makes a CISO able to deliver this effectively. In this paper, we report the results from 5 in-depth interviews with CISOs, which were analysed using organisational behaviour theory. The results show that the CISOs struggle to gain credibility within their organisation due to: a perceived lack of power, confusion about their role identity, and their inability to engage effectively with employees. We conclude that as the CISO role continues to develop CISOs need to reflect on effective ways of achieving credibility in their organisations and, in particular, to work on communicating with employees and engaging them in security initiatives. We also identify a key responsibility for effective CISOs; that is to remove the blockages that prevent information security from becoming 'business as usual' rather than a specialist function.

This book is aimed at all those who exploit the results of this new science, as designers and as consumers. The first chapter is an overview of the related history, demonstrating the long development of ideas such as recursion and more recent formalizations such as computability. The second chapter shows how the design of algorithms requires appropriate techniques and sophisticated organization of data. In the subsequent chapters the contributing authors present examples from diverse areas - such as routing and networking problems, Web search, information security, auctions and games, complexity and randomness, and the life sciences - that show how algorithmic thinking offers practical solutions and also deepens domain knowledge. The contributing authors are top-class researchers with considerable academic and industrial experience; they are also excellent educators and communicators and they draw on this experience with enthusiasm and humor.

Since they are able to securely generate and store secrets, they allow us to bootstrap the physical implementation of an information security system. In this book the author discusses PUFs in all their facets: the multitude of their physical constructions, the algorithmic and physical properties which describe them, and the techniques required to deploy them in security applications. The author first presents an extensive overview and classification of PUF constructions, with a focus on so-called intrinsic PUFs. He identifies subclasses, implementation properties, and design techniques used to amplify submicroscopic physical distinctions into observable digital response vectors. He lists the useful qualities attributed to PUFs and captures them in descriptive definitions, identifying the truly PUF-defining properties in the process, and he also presents the details of a formal framework for deploying PUFs and similar physical primitives in cryptographic reductions. The author then describes a silicon test platform carrying different intrinsic PUF structures which was used to objectively compare their reliability, uniqueness, and unpredictability based on experimental data. In the final chapters, the author explains techniques for PUF-based entity identification, entity authentication, and secure key generation. He proposes practical schemes that implement these techniques, and derives and calculates measures for assessing different PUF constructions in these applications based on the quality of their response statistics. Finally, he presents a fully functional prototype implementation of a PUF-based cryptographic key generator, demonstrating the full benefit of using PUFs and the efficiency of the processing techniques described.

Yet, the unregulated expansion of eDTCA has resulted in unaddressed global public health threats. Specifically, illicit online pharmacies are engaged in the sale of purportedly safe, legitimate product that may in fact be counterfeit or substandard. These cybercriminal actors exploit available eDTCA mediums over the Internet to market their suspect products globally. Despite these risks, a detailed assessment of the public health, patient safety, and cybersecurity threats and governance mechanisms to address them has not been conducted.Discussion: Illicit online pharmacies represent a significant global public health and patient safety risk. Existing governance mechanisms are insufficient and include lack of adequate adoption in national regulation, ineffective voluntary governance mechanisms, and uneven global law enforcement efforts that have allowed proliferation of these cybercriminals on the web. In order to effectively address this multistakeholder threat, inclusive global governance strategies that engage the information technology, law enforcement and public health sectors should be established.Summary: Effective global ""eHealth Governance"" focused on cybercrime is needed in order to effectively combat illicit online pharmacies. This includes building upon existing Internet governance structures and coordinating partnership between the UN Office of Drugs and Crime that leads the global fight against transnational organized crime and the Internet Governance Forum that is shaping the future of Internet governance. Through a UNODC-IGF governance mechanism, investigation, detection and coordination of activities against illicit online pharmacies and their misuse of eDTCA can commence. © 2013 Mackey and Liang; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Counterfeit medicines; Cybercrime; Direct-to-consumer advertising; Global health; Internet governance; Online pharmacies; Social media","Crime; Drug and Narcotic Control; Drug Industry; Humans; International Cooperation; Internationality; Internet; Law Enforcement; Marketing; Patient Safety; Pharmacies; Public Health; advertising; crime; drug; governance approach; Internet; marketing; media role; medicine; public health; safety; social network; United Nations; article; consumer advocacy; crime; digital computer; drug marketing; health behavior; health care cost; health care delivery; health care quality; health promotion; health service; human; information technology; Internet; life cycle; medical information; online system; patient safety; pharmacy; priority journal; public health; risk assessment; social media; society; crime; drug control; drug industry; international cooperation; Internet; law enforcement; legal aspect; marketing"

Based on the achievements in security protection technologies for the secondary electrical systems and by means of such technological means as enhancing the protection for the border of industrial control network, analyzing communication protocols for industrial control in depth, mining attack signature models of industrial control protocol and establishing a unified security management platform and so on, a general security protection system for industrial control information, which possesses the ability of defense in depth, is constructed. Through simulating both industrial control environment and network attack, the industrial control firewall for key components is researched and tested, and the results show that under the premise of ensuring normal operation of authorized communication of industrial control system the constructed general security protection system can intercept the unauthorized control commands, so it possesses the ability of information security of industrial control systems in depth.

Hence, it is straightforward that DNS nameservers are constantly under the threat of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This paper presents a new, stealthy from the attacker's viewpoint, flavor of DNSSEC-powered amplification attack that takes advantage of the vast number of DNS forwarders out there. Specifically, for augmenting the amplification factor, the attacker utilizes only those forwarders that support DNSSEC-related resource records and advertize a large DNS size packet. The main benefits of the presented attack scenario as compared to that of the typical amplification attack are: (a) The revocation of the need of the aggressor to control a botnet, and (b) the elimination of virtually all traces that may be used toward disclosing the attacker's actions, true identity and geographical location. The conducted experiments taking into consideration three countries, namely Greece, Ireland and Portugal demonstrate that with a proper but simple planning and a reasonable amount of resources, a determined perpetrator is able to create a large torrent of bulky DNS packets towards its target. In the context of the present study this is translated to a maximum amplification factor of 44. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, as information security risks become increasingly complex and difficult for users to understand, this approach may be less feasible. The average user may be able to imagine the worst case scenario should an asset be compromised by an attacker, but he has few means to determine the likelihood of this happening. In this paper we therefore propose a different approach to measuring risk perception. Based on well established concepts from formal risk analysis, we define an instrument to measure users' risk perception that combines the strengths of both traditional risk perception and formal risk analysis. By being more explicit and specific concerning possible attackers, existing security measures and vulnerabilities, users will be more able to give meaningful answers to scale items, thereby providing a better and more explanatory measure of risk perception. As part of the instrument development we also elaborate on construct definitions, construct types and the relationship between these and the corresponding risk perception instrument. Although it remains to be verified empirically, the validity of the measure is discussed by linking it to well established theory and practice. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","","Information systems; Instruments; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Security of data; Information security risks; Instrument development; Quantitative risk; Security measure; Theory and practice; Worst case scenario; Risk assessment"

The research aims to illustrate the usefulness of social action theory (SAT) for management of information security. Design/methodology/approach - This research was carried out as a longitudinal case study at a Swedish hospital. Data were collected using a combination of interviews, information security documents, and observations. Data were analysed using a combination of a value-based compliance model and the taxonomy laid out in SAT to determine user rationality. Findings - The paper argues that management of information security and design of countermeasures should be based on an understanding of users' rationale covering both intentional and unintentional non-compliance. The findings are presented in propositions with practical and theoretical implications: P1. Employees' non-compliance is predominantly based on means-end calculations and based on a practical rationality, P2. An information security investigation of employees' rationality should not be based on an a priori assumption about user intent, P3. Information security management and choice of countermeasures should be based on an understanding of the use rationale, and P4. Countermeasures should target intentional as well as unintentional non-compliance. Originality/value - This work is an extension of Hedström et al. arguing for the importance of addressing user rationale for successful management of information security.

These policies are characterised by increased similarities among the information security requirements of different sectors of society. Also, they are characterised by the increased differences in comparison with the traditional approach to the security within the closed environment. Key factors of the information security policy: people, process, and technology, are closely related to the requirements and restrictions imposed on certain type of information. In that way the approach to conceptual information modelling becomes one of the central problems of contemporary information security policies. The paper elaborates the approach to the conceptual information modelling, stressing the requirements of both the protection and the sharing of information. It offers the taxonomy of the main terms, which is the base for the development of proposed conceptual model of the information definition and sharing. The conceptual model is based on the standard UML graphical notation that makes it easier to visualize and understand the proposed model and the approach applied in the paper.

To alleviate these challenges, researchers are looking into various two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) visualization tools to detect, identify, and analyze malicious attacks. These visualization tools often require advanced knowledge in networking, visualization, and information security to operate, navigate, and successfully examine malicious attacks. Novice users, deficient in the required advanced knowledge, may find navigation within these visualization tools difficult. Furthermore, expert users may be limited and costly. We discuss the use of a modern recommender system to aid in navigating within a complex 3D visualization for network security applications. We developed a visualization module called NAVSEC, a recommender system prototype for navigating in 3D network security visualization tools. NAVSEC recommends visualizations and interactions to novice users. Given visualization interaction input from a novice user and expert communities, NAVSEC is instrumental in reducing confusion for a novice user while navigating in a 3D visualization. We illustrate NAVSEC with a use-case from an emulated stealthy scanning attack disguised as a file transfer with multiple concurrent connections. We show that using NAVSEC, a novice user's visualization converges towards a visualization used to identify or detect a suspected attack by an expert user. As a result, NAVSEC can successfully guide the novice user in differentiating between complex network attacks and benign legitimate traffic with step-by-step created visualizations and suggested user interactions.

Carrying out a ""network storm"" attack according to the second scenario implies exploiting a vulnerability during the routing process - when on the strength of the default settings there is a regular situation of uncertainty between two components of an ITCS, which can be exploited by the malicious user who directs a critical volume of malicious traffic at the elements of the ITCS being attacked, which will also lead to a disruption of the availability of information and information resources. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Denial of service; Flooding attack; Information and telecommunication system; Information security; Network storm",""

The methods are mainly in three aspects: position integrity, position confidentiality, and position availability. The position integrity methods focus on validating a vehicle's position to ensure the position information is correct. Position confidentiality ensures not only the confidentiality of position information but also the authentication of location that a location related message can only decrypt by the receiver which is ""physically"" present inside a decryption region that is specified by location, time, and speed. The position availability methods create and maintain a reliable routing path to delivery position information. The selection and maintenance of routing paths in literature can be based on multiple resources, for example wireless signal strength, computation resources, and probability models. The three aspects, position integrity, position confidentiality, and position availability, are the three basic requirements of information security based on the standard 200 of NIST. © 2014, IGI Global.","","Location; Network security; Security of data; Wireless networks; Computation resources; Location information; Multiple resources; Position information; Probability models; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular wireless networks; Wireless signals; Vehicular ad hoc networks"

To handle this problem, the Institute of Digital Forensics in Japan developed guidelines to preserve the evidence of electronic records. However, it is not easy for individuals to preserve evidence without a computer aid because of the volume of records demanded by the guidelines. Therefore, to easily transmit text of the guidelines, we developed a total support system named DFGUIDE consisting of a GST (guideline support tool) in PCs for the guideline authors and a BTG (guideline browsing tool) for first responders using an Android phone.

It provides a way to certify copyrights of image files, as well as a means of secret communication for people. In this paper, we propose a reversible image information hiding scheme based on vector quantization (VQ). The proposed scheme uses a new technique called Adjoining State-Codebook Mapping (ASCM) to map the content of an image block to an index in the corresponding state-codebooks. The ASCM technique uses two adjacent image blocks of an encoding image block to create two state-codebooks, which can represent the encoding image block more accurately. Therefore, it can reduce the size of the output code-stream and yet still provide large embedding capacity for secret data. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme has better compression bit rate and larger embedding capacity when we compare the proposed scheme with recent similar studies, proposed by Chang et al. in 2009 and Yang et al. in 2011 respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, we systematically investigate how individuals with cognitive disabilities, specifically Down syndrome (DS), interact with various user authentication mechanisms. This research provides the first benchmark data on the performance of individuals with DS when using multiple authentication methods. It confirms that individuals with DS are capable of using the traditional alphanumeric passwords with reasonable efficiency. The passwords created by individuals with DS are of similar strength to those created by neurotypical people. Graphic passwords are not as effective as traditional alphanumeric and mnemonic passwords regarding efficiency, and are less preferred by the participants.

As WSNs are usually deployed in remote or hostile environments and nodes are prone to compromise attacks, the adoption of key management is extremely important. Most queries in WSN applications are issued at the point of the base station or gateway node of the network. However, there is a great need to access the real-time data inside the network from the nodes because the real-time data may no longer be accessed through the base station only but also by the legal user with authority. To support the requirement, recently Das et al. proposed a dynamic password-based user authentication scheme for hierarchical WSNs. The purposes of this paper are to show Das et al.'s scheme has a security problem of password guessing attack with lost smart card and to provide a remedy for the scheme. For this, we will give a security analysis of Das et al.'s scheme focused on the offline password guessing attack with the assumption that the attacker could steal user's smart card and read the memory on it. Then, we will propose a user authentication scheme for hierarchical WSNs to solve the security problem in Das et al.'s scheme.

To ensure information security, a security risk assessment is needed. Compared to traditional methods, such as AHP, fuzzy logic, and grey analysis, an approach based on grey incidence and D-S theory of evidence is put forward to evaluate information system security in this paper. Firstly, the uncertainty in index parameter values is analyzed, according to the actual condition and history statistical data, the vacant index parameter values may meet three kinds of distributions: uniform distribution, exponential distribution, and normal distribution. The corresponding prior estimates are given to fill the vacant values up. Then, the concept of interval conversion operator is defined, using grey incidence to determine the uncertain degrees of different indices, and the mass functions are obtained by the uncertain degrees. Finally, mass functions are fused in accordance with the rule of combination and sequence the information system security risk according to the belief function value. An example application has proved the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. The results indicate this method can obviously reduce the overall uncertainty and provide a new thought to information security risk assessment approaches. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","D-S theory of evidence; Grey incidence; Information security; Risk assessment","Fuzzy logic; Information systems; Normal distribution; Risk assessment; Security of data; D-S theory of evidence; Exponential distributions; Grey incidence; Information security risk assessment; Information system security; Security risk assessments; Statistical datas; Uniform distribution; Uncertainty analysis"

UMS devices are found among virtually any person in the workplace today. However, UMS devices hold significant security risks, often overlooked. These risks arise mainly due to their compact size, storage capacity or the fact that UMS technology is integrated into Smartphones, cameras, music players, to name most significant. Considering that UMS technology is incorporated into devices that employees need daily to perform their work, such as Smartphones, it is not a feasible option to ban UMS technology from the workplace. However, without a guiding framework, UMS devices pose security risks to both organization and individual users. This paper reports on research conducted at the research institution in South Africa to evaluate the employee's understanding of the security risks to the organization and to them in person.

User authentication using fingerprints, only the user with the information that is specific to the authentication security is strong. But there are disadvantage such as the user cannot change the authentication key.

The tendency of information security incidents might increase due to this transformation. One of the solutions is by embedding employees with knowledge regarding information security. Previous literatures have examined knowledge management (KM) in general and omitted healthcare informatics perspective. However, knowledge sharing between employees in healthcare organization can be challenging as their background and expertise domains differ. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of key resistance factors in knowledge sharing towards information security culture in healthcare organization. Based on the secondary data collected, the key resistance factors identified are behavior, lack of trust, lack of communication, low security awareness, personality differences, cultural differences, lack of top management commitment, and openness to experience. A conceptual model was proposed to represent the key resistance factors identified.

While the former method typically has better performance, all the users' hopping patterns must be coordinated to maintain orthogonality. Because the processing gain of frequency-hop systems relies on the secrecy of the hopping pattern, having a potentially large number of users with knowledge of coordinated hopping patterns may be undesirable. Rather, multiple smaller groups that are cryptographically isolated from each other are preferred. In this paper, we discuss alternatives for supporting multiple such cryptographically-isolated user groups in frequency-hopping spread spectrum systems. Tradeoffs among interference rejection, data rate, and number of supportable users are considered for a variety of channel access schemes and hopping pattern designs. In addition, the impact of improved receiver capabilities, such as multiuser detection, to the trade space is investigated. © 2013 IEEE.","Frequency hopping; Information assurance; Multiuser detection; Spread spectrum","Commerce; Cryptography; Frequency hopping; Military communications; Multiuser detection; Better performance; Frequency hopping spread spectrum; Hopping patterns; Information assurance; Interference rejection; Non-orthogonal; Processing gain; Spread spectra; Multiple access interference"

Secondly, a label-based information flow control protocol, namely LBIFC, is presented. This protocol is based on request/decision protocol between service providers. Thirdly, both the theoretical analysis and experimental validation of proposed LBIFC are provided.

The main reason for these problems is the unavoidable loss of physical control that costumers are forced to accept when opting for the cloud model. This aspect, united with the lack of knowledge (i.e. transparency) of the vendor's infrastructure implementation, represents a nasty question when costumers are asked to respond to audit findings, produce support for forensic investigations, and, more generically, to ensure compliance with information security standards and regulations. Yet, support for security standards compliance is a need for cloud providers to overcome customers hesitancy and meet their expectations. In this context, tracking, auditing, and reporting practices, while transcending the compliance regimes, represent the primary vehicle of assurance for security managers and auditors on the achievement of security and regulatory compliance objectives. The aim of this chapter is to provide a roundup of crucial requirements resulting from common security certification standards and regulation. Then, the chapter reports an overview of approaches and methodologies for addressing compliance coming from the most relevant initiatives on cloud security and a survey of what storage cloud vendors declare to do in terms of compliance.

Compliance with information security policies is a notoriously difficult issue. Social sciences could provide tools to empirically study compliance with policies. We use a variation of the lost-letter technique to study IT risk behaviour, using USB keys instead of letters. The observational lost-letter study by Farrington and Knight (1979) was replicated in a university setting by dropping 106 USB keys. Labels on the USB keys were used to vary characteristics of the alleged victim. Observers noted characteristics of people who picked a USB key up and whether the USB key was returned. Results show that USB keys in their original box are stolen more than used ones and that people aged 30 or younger and those who place a found USB key in their pocket are more likely to steal. This suggests that the decision to steal a USB key is taken at the moment of pick up, despite ample opportunity to return it.

Secondly, membership function of indicators based on Gaussian function was defined, thereafter, an improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model based on membership matrix constructor method was given to reduce the influence of subjective factors.

A description of app behavior is useful for performing subsequent analysis such as model checking, for example to verify the app satisfies a set of desirable security properties. Our solution is to dynamically execute the app in a customized version of the Android SDK emulator, which provides many of an app's inputs as responses to invoked API calls. A more focused set of input values computed offline are then injected to the app via hooks introduced into the Android API implementation. To dynamically monitor app behavior, we instrument the app bytecode to record control and data flows during execution. We also instrument the Android API to record all of the app's inputs and outputs. We have used this technique on the DARPA Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) program to reveal hidden, triggerable attacks in independently developed challenge apps.

Recently, gate level information flow tracking (GLIFT) has been proposed to monitor all digital information flows in the underlying hardware and prevent information leakage caused by undesired interference between different hardware components. However, existing work in this realm restricts to combinational logic, which is not applicable for sequential circuits. This paper extends the GLIFT method to sequential logic and presents various methodologies for secure hardware design by enforcing bit-tight information flow control.

The attackers target the protocols to exhaust resources by either disabling the servers or disrupting the protocol exchange. In fact, almost all the communication protocols including TCP, HIP, etc. are vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks. One of the ways of dealing with the DoS attacks is to carry out a cost analysis of the impact of the DoS attacks and ensure that the impact of the same is minimized to the extent possible. We illustrate the applicability of the same to analyze the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) version2 protocol. IKEv2 is one of the significant protocol of IPSec suite. It establishes the security association between source and destination before IPSec connection establishes. In this paper, we analyze IKEv2 protocol to show that IKE v2 is susceptible to DoS attacks.

Corporate Social responsibility is imperative sighting the ever escalating crime and abuse of information. As a result managers' fiduciary duty to protect information is increasingly under scrutiny by national and international regulators. While measures have been put in place to ensure security and compliance, recent evidence suggests organisations still struggle to comply with regulations. A review of previous studies indicates fragmented work on compliance and the significance of the influencing factors has not been determined. This paper aims to create awareness of the regulatory frameworks governing the use of IT, and the factors influencing compliance with information security regulations in the financial sector in South Africa. A conceptual framework explaining the nature of factors influencing compliance was developed and tested in a case study of one financial institution. Mixed methods were used to collect and analyse the data. The results show that compliance is mainly influenced by culture and the influence of mimetic pressure insigmficant. In addition, there appears to be much focus on international than national regulations.

In the DRPE SS-SS method, the watermark is in the form of a digital barcode image which is numerically encrypted using a simulation of the optical DRPE process. This produces a random complex image, which is then processed to form a real valued random image with a low number of quantization levels. This signal is added to the host image. Extraction of the barcode, involves applying an inverse DRPE process to the watermarked image followed by a low pass filter. This algorithm is designed to utilize the capability of the DRPE to reversibly spread the energy of the watermarking information in both the space and spatial frequency domains, and the energy of the watermark in any spatial or spatial frequency bin is very small. The common geometric transformations and signal processing operations are performed using both the informed and the blind detections for different barcode widths and different quantization levels.

In preparing this implementation guide, input has been sought from experts throughout Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. A lot of professional judgment and experience are applied in the architecture, engineering, and implementation of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) guide to ensure that it logs the information necessary to successfully increase visibility and remove ambiguity, surrounding the security events and risks that an organization faces. By providing SIEM as a service under SecaaS, the provider has to be able to accept log and event information, customer information and event feeds, and conduct information security analysis, correlation, and support incident response. By providing flexible real-time access to SIEM information, it allows the party consuming the SIEM service to identify threats acting against their environment cloud. This identification then allows for the appropriate action and response to be taken to protect or mitigate the threat. The simple step of increasing visibility and removing ambiguity is a powerful tool to understanding the information security risks that an organization is facing. © 2014, IGI Global.

In this work we face the problem of data security in grid, by proposing a lightweight cryptography algorithm combining the strong and highly secure asymmetric cryptography technique (RSA) with the symmetric cryptography (Advanced Encryption Standard, AES). The proposed algorithm, we named Grid Secure Storage System (GS3), has been implemented on top of the Grid File Access Library (GFAL) of the gLite middleware, in order to provide a file system service with cryptography capability and POSIX interface. The choice of implementing GS3 as a file system allows to protect also the file system structure, and moreover to overcome the well-known problem of file rewriting in gLite/GFAL environments.

We propose a research model that studies ISA's institutional, individual, and environmental antecedents and investigates the mediating role of ISA. The model was empirically tested with survey data from 475 employees. The model explains a substantial proportion of the variance of ISA (.50) and intention to comply (.41). The results imply that the provision of security policies and employees' knowledge on information systems are the most influential antecedents of ISA. The study shows that ISA mediates the relationship between ISA's antecedents and behavioral intention.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper surveyed members of the UKIA community and achieved a 52 percent response rate (n = 104). The paper used a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) technique to map the multi-agency cooperation space and factor analysis and ordinary least squares regression to identify predictive factors of cooperation frequency. Qualitative data were also solicited via the survey and interviews with security managers. Findings - Via the quantitative measures, the paper locates gaps in the multi-agency cooperation network and identifies predictors of cooperation. The data indicate an over-crowded cybersecurity space, problems in apprehending perpetrators, and poor business case justifications for SMEs as potential inhibitors to cooperation, while concern over certain cybercrimes and perceptions of organisational effectiveness were identified as motivators. Practical implications - The data suggest that the neo-liberal rationality that has been evoked in other areas of crime control is also evident in the control of cybercrimes. The paper concludes divisions exist between the High Policing rhetoric of the UK's Cyber Security Strategy and the (relatively) Low Policing cooperation outcomes in ""on the ground"" cyber-policing. If the cooperation outcomes advocated by the UK Cyber Security Strategy are to be realised, UKIA organisations must begin to acknowledge and remedy gaps and barriers in cooperation. Originality/value - This paper provides the first mixed-methods evidence on the multi-agency cooperation patterns amongst the UKIA community in the UK and highlights significant gaps in the network. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cooperation; Cybercrime; Cybersecurity networks; Information sharing; Partnership","Computer crime; Surveys; Cooperation; Cyber security; Cybercrime; Information sharing; Partnership; Security of data"

For checking the identities of the user and the cloud server, they must do mutual user authentication before using the cloud services. Also, the transmitted messages between them must be protected. These environments are different with traditional client-server environments since a cloud user may use many various devices to connect to the cloud server to do authentication. It will face the following problems. The first problem is that some devices only have low computing and memory ability. The second problem is that the cloud user may have many various devices for storing secret sensitive information. If some devices are lost, it is hard to recover the sensitive information stored in these devices. In order to solve all the above problems, we propose a lightweight robust and privacy protection authentication scheme for cloud computing. Our proposed authentication scheme can prevent the insider attack even if the secret information stored in a cloud database is compromised and the offline dictionary attack even if the secret information stored in a user's device is compromised. Also, the cloud user can freely choose his password to use our proposed authentication scheme. © 2013 ICIC International.","Cloud computing; Identity authentication; Information security; Low-resource device; Privacy protection","Cloud computing; Security of data; Authentication scheme; Client-server environment; Identity authentication; Low-resource device; Off-line dictionary attacks; Privacy protection; Sensitive informations; User authentication; Authentication"

Thus the research paper will investigate the ways to educate any organization members with the concepts of information and network security and taking the advantages of e-learning to make such training efficient and easy to use. The research paper attempts to develop an E-Laboratory that will achieve the above goals via the training of users with the security concepts to be able to protect their information and networks. The paper presents the design and implementation of the e-laboratory that covers most of the important aspects of information and network security. The e-lab can also be used to detect the security breaches of the system and even the development of information and network security in future. Several well known techniques for defending the information and networks have been included in the e-lab with a simple user friendly interface. © 2013 IEEE.","e-learning; security mechanisms; security services; security threats","Curricula; Design; E-learning; Laboratories; Personnel training; Research; Security systems; Design and implementations; Information and network securities; Information security trainings; Organizational system; Security mechanism; Security services; Security threats; User friendly interface; Network security"

Fault attack, which aims to inject fault into the chip during the calculation, is a serious threat to the information security of the chip. Thus considerable countermeasures are involved to meet the overall requirements and facilitate the intended application for bank IC cards. In this paper, countermeasures against fault attacks for 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm) which is one of the widely used block ciphers in the bank IC cards are designed and implemented. Those countermeasures in our paper are based on the symmetry structure of DES block and we try to dig the efficiency in it. The basic countermeasure reduces the time latency from 100% to 1/n × 100% for n round block cipher. On the basis of this, an optimized countermeasure lowers the redundancy rate from 1/4 to 1/16. Another optimization reduces the area cost of duplication than the second method, which has the same latency. The countermeasures are designed for the 3DES algorithm in RTL level, implemented and verified in FPGA board. The fault attack platform successfully injected clock glitch into the DES engine and demonstrated the validity of the countermeasure. Over 1000 3DES calculations are tested and the successful detection rate is 100%. © 2013 IEEE.","Bank IC card; Block cipher; Chip security; Countermeasure; Fault attack","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Cryptography; Eddy currents; Engines; Optimization; Security of data; Block ciphers; Chip security; Countermeasure; Fault attack; IC card; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)"

We, therefore, define InfoSec self-efficacy as a group-level construct and examine its impact on InfoSec vulnerability from cross-cultural perspectives. We draw on interdependent security and separate InfoSec vulnerability into vulnerability from self and partners. The goal is fourfold: (i) proposing InfoSec collective efficacy as a cultural construct, (ii) modeling relationships among InfoSec collective efficacy, InfoSec vulnerability, vulnerability from partners, and InfoSec control awareness from cross-cultural perspectives, (iii) validating the model using data collectedfrom executive-level IS managers in the U.S. and South Korea, and (iv) providing implications for IS managers operating in multinational businesses. © (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","Collective efficacy; Cross-country comparison; Cross-cultural issues; Security","Management; Managers; Security of data; Collective efficacy; Cross-country comparison; Cross-cultural issues; Individual levels; Information systems security; Model relationships; Multinational business; Security; Information systems"

Data management and backup are becoming increasingly important in these environments. Backup systems constitute an important component of operating system security. However, it is difficult to recover backup data from an environment where the operating system does not work because the storage hardware has been damaged. This study analyzes the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) used by the Windows operating system. Windows 8 has been implemented for mobile environments; hence, it could be used for data recovery from damaged mobile devices. VSS is a backup infrastructure provided by Windows that creates point-in-time copies of a volume (known as volume shadow copies). Windows Vista and later versions use this service instead of the restore point feature used in earlier versions of the operating system. The restore point feature logically copied and stored specified files, whereas VSS copies and stores only data that have changed in the volume. In a live system, volume shadow copies can be checked and recovered using built-in system commands. However, it is difficult to analyze the files stored in the volume shadow copies of a nonfunctioning system, such as a disk image, because only the changed data are stored. Therefore, this study analyzes the structure of Volume Shadow Copy (VSC) files that were logically stored. This analysis confirms the locations of the changed data and original copies by identifying a structure that stores the file data stream to file system metadata. On the basis of our research, we propose a practical application to develop tools for the recovery of snapshot data stored within the VSC files. We also present results of our successful performance test. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Data recovery; Hybrid information security; Mobile device; Windows 8","Data streams; Digital storage; Information management; Mobile computing; Mobile security; Recovery; Restoration; Security of data; Built in systems; Data recovery; Grid and cloud computing; Mobile environments; Operating system security; Performance tests; Storage hardware; Windows 8; Windows operating system"

The existing methods delivers the same amount of privacy for all persons, and may be offering insufficient protection to a subset of people, while applying excessive privacy control to another subset.

In this scheme, each signer has the right to choose randomly his/her own individual keystone and retrieve all other individual keystones by the Extraction algorithm. If all signers release their own individual keystones, all signatures can be bound. There is not a decisive signer or a more power signer in selecting and releasing keystones. Therefore, the situation of keystones switched by dishonest signers can be effectively avoided and the fairness of the MPCS scheme is also apparently improved.

Through the utilization of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), we will organize the crossover factors of the software blind spots and build an evaluation framework. First of all, via the fuzzy Delphi method the aspects and relative determinants affecting security will be filtered out. Then we will identify the value equation of each factor and settle down the fuzzy synthetic decision making model of software vulnerability. Thanks to this model we will be able to analyze the various degrees to which the vulnerability is affecting the security and this information will serve as a basis for future ameliorations of the system itself. The higher the security score obtained therefore imply securer system. Beside this, this study also propose an improvement from the traditional fuzzy synthetic decision making model for measuring the fuzziness between enhancement and independence of various aspects and criteria. Furthermore taking into consideration the subjectivity of human in reality and constructing the fuzzy integral decision making model. Through case study, we show that the evaluation model in question is practical and can be applied on the new software vulnerabilities and measure their degree of penetration.

The accuracy and protection of this data is essential for the Air Traffic Management process. System Track radar data securing by adding a digital signature to each system track. A record requires high processing resources, especially for 2048 bits RSA keys. This approach does not modify the ASTERIX code structure thus keeping the compatibility with other communication partners. However, the use of this method in a sensitive environment like Air Traffic Management may obstruct real time radar data processing. The aim of this paper is to indicate new securing methods that will overcome this problem. Two alternatives are proposed and analyzed that can be combined in order to secure the data in real time. One alternative is using more powerful processing units and the other is applying an optimized method for adding a digital signature to system track data.

Since the operations of CII also affect physical world, they are a good example of large-scale, critical cyber-physical systems. In recent years, CII become an attractive target for cyber attacks and the potential impact of a successful attack could lead to disastrous consequences in the physical world. Thus ensuring the security of CII is of vital importance. A fundamental prerequisite to secure a CII system is a clear understanding and a consistent view of its architecture. However, because of the complexity and scale, this is challenging to acquire. In this paper, we propose a layered architectural view for CII, which aims at building a common ground among stakeholders and supporting the implementation of information security management processes. In order to manage the complexity and scale, we define four interrelated architectural layers, and use the concept of viewpoints to focus on a subset of the system. We indicate the applicability of our approach in the context of CII security analysis.","Critical Information Infrastructure; Information security; Reference model; System architecture","Complex networks; Embedded systems; Information management; Information technology; Network architecture; Network security; Power plants; Security of data; Security systems; Architectural layers; Architectural modeling; Architectural views; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Information infrastructures; Information security managements; Reference modeling; System architectures; Critical infrastructures"

The mobile SMS documents are partitioned into segments, wherein the discovered topics in each segment are propagated to influence the discovery of latent features. The proposed technique filters malicious mobile SMS communication and shows that topic models can effectively detect distinctive latent features to support automatic content filtering overtime. The practical implication of SMS communication filtering is apparent in designing systems that proactively detect information security threats to mobile subscribers and operators.

More precisely, we show that for all positive integers m and q there exists the least positive integer N(m,q) which is smaller than m2q-1 and satisfies the following: If α is a word such that (i) |alph(α)|≥N(m,q) (i.e., the cardinality of the alphabet of α is at least N(m,q)); and (ii) |α| a ≤q for each a*̂alph(α) (i.e., the number of occurrences of any symbol of alph(α) in α is at most q), then there exist a set A⊆alph(α) of cardinality |A|=m, an integer p* {1,2,.,q}, and permutations σ 1,σ 2,⋯,σ p :{1,2,.,m}→{1,2,.,m} for which πA (α)ε aσ1 (1)+ aσ1 (m)}+aσ2 (1)}+aσ2 (m)}+ aσp(1)+ aσp(m)} +.

The emergence of new networking technologies, like Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN), opens up new venues for large scale adoption of these cyber security tools. In particular, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) engines can be virtualized and dynamically deployed as pieces of software on commodity hardware. Deploying such software DPI engines is costly in terms of license fees and power consumption. Designing cost effective DPI engine deployment strategies that meet the cybersecurity operational constraints is thus mandatory for the adoption of this approach. For this purpose, we propose a method, based on genetic algorithms, that optimizes the cost of DPI engine deployment, minimizing their number, the global network load and the number of unanalyzed flows. We conduct several experiments with different types of traffic and different cost structures. The results show that the method is able to reach a trade-off between the number of DPI engines and network load. Furthermore, the global cost can be reduced up to 58% when relaxing the constraint on the used link capacity, that is the provisioning rate. © 2013 IEEE.","","Engines; Military communications; Packet networks; Commodity hardware; Deep packet inspection; Deep packet inspection (DPI); Deployment strategy; Monitoring mechanisms; Networking technology; Operational constraints; Software defined networking (SDN); Costs"

Unfortunately, this mode of operation serves as a vulnerability amplifier because each computer executes multiple versions of the same operating code base carrying the same vulnerabilities. This paper explores compiler and linker based approaches to increase attacker workload by generating diversity in the binary code associated with a single source. This is achieved by injecting randomness into the binary image. Entropy is used as a metric of diversity and we explore the relationship between three components of this measure: padding entropy within a logical block, ordering entropy over a program, and joint entropy associated with function layout. Collectively these components can be combined in an analytical expression that provides an upper bound on the number of variants that can be generated for a single source code. This general approach serves as a basis for combining additional transformations. These transformations can then be applied to diversify operating systems and military cloud applications, such as Apache Accumulo. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer security; Information security","Military applications; Military communications; Program compilers; Security of data; Analytical expressions; Cloud applications; Joint entropy; Mode of operations; Resource savings; Shared resources; Three component; Virtual machines; Entropy"

Despite its importance, the effects of using IT in administrations has been less studied by the academy in comparison with using it in businesses, so there is an absence of works focused on analyzing which technologies administrations apply and which results they produce. Accordingly, this chapter aims to analyze the practical results that may be encountered in the application of CRM 2.0 in public administrations. For this, firstly, the CRM concept and its application are analyzed, finding that traditional CRM maintains a unidirectional approach of information, with little room for citizen participation. Secondly, to overcome the one-way approach, concept of Web 2.0, based on the collaborative use of the IT, which extends the possibilities of interaction between administrations and citizens is presented. This integration of traditional CRM with Web 2.0 gives rise to the CRM 2.0; its applications are expected to be the opportunity to modernize services and move closer to citizens. However, the literature has not identified the specific effects of applying CRM 2.0 in public administrations. In this sense, the work identifies some practical results of these implementations through exploratory research by applying a Delphi to senior managers of nine Spanish public administrations; this has allowed the authors to identify as principal results an improved productivity, an increased citizen satisfaction, and a better integration of information.

In 2012, a NNEC assessment of a NATO Response Force (NRF) rotation during Exercise Steadfast Cobalt (SFCT) 2012 was performed. The outcome of the assessment showed a number of constraints that prevent seamless information sharing and exploitation across the various mission partners. Two issues were identified as critical to enable information sharing in NRF: (a) the need to implement a more strict approach to Information Management, along a proper set of processes and tools, and (b) the requirement to enable automatic or semi-automatic transfer of information between different security domains, therefore enabling a single information domain where partners can access and share the vast majority of mission information. The solution should ideally also enable information sharing with Non-Traditional Partners (NTPs) in compliance with the NATO Comprehensive Approach to operations. This paper summarizes the findings of the NNEC assessment performed during 2012 Steadfast Cobalt NRF exercise, and the solution proposed to resolve the identified information management and information sharing constraints. The proposed solution, in line with NNEC recommendations for the Future Mission Network (FMN) concept is based on an information clearinghouse function and a release gateway. The clearinghouse maintains a tightly configuration-controlled catalog of mission relevant information, to ensure users easily find and access the latest approved version of any information product. In addition, the clearinghouse provides support to a release authority and to a release gateway, which allow semi-automatic transfer of releasable products between different security domains. The combination of the three elements creates the perception of a single information domain. The paper describes the impact of the solution on information sharing by repeating the NNEC assessment, and provides a number of recommendations on how to achieve those benefits in current or future NATO operations. © 2013 IEEE.","Comprehensive Approach (CA); Exercise Steadfast Cobalt (SFCT); Future Mission Network; Inform; Information Assurance (IA); Information Clearinghouse (ICH); NATO Network-Enabled Capabilities (NNEC); NATO Response Force (NRF); Non-Traditional Partners (NTPs)","Cobalt; Information analysis; Information management; Military communications; Comprehensive Approach (CA); Exercise Steadfast Cobalt (SFCT); Future mission; Inform; Information assurance; Information Clearinghouse (ICH); NATO Response Force; Network-enabled capabilities; Non-traditional; Gateways (computer networks)"

Findings - The two applications of the framework revealed that interrelationships do exist between the different controls employed in actual security implementations and that these dependencies are seldom accounted for. When those few controls that are to be measured are clearly identified, the security experts can focus their attention on them and ensure their correct implementation and appropriate measurement. The extent of impact of a single control on the overall security picture of the firm can also be found using this approach. Research limitations/implications - While the framework is generic, the assurance values obtained are context-sensitive. This is primarily because of the subjectivity involved in assigning impact measures and initial values. Practical implications - This work helps in answering two difficult questions in information security management: ""what to measure?"" and ""how to quantify the overall security assurance of the organization?"" This assists the information security team in identifying and refining those controls that needs to be appropriately emphasized. The proposed framework helps the top management in doing ""what-if"" analysis, thereby aiding their decision-making for information security investments. Originality/value - The novel framework proposes a top-down approach for security control refinement and a bottom-up approach for combining the confidence values to obtain an indicator for ISA. This work identifies and accommodates the possibilities of having interdependencies between security controls. The proposed aggregation method using FCM is being applied for the first time in information security context and provides convergence even in the presence of cyclic dependencies amongst the controls. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Fuzzy cognitive maps; Information security assurance; Information security management; ISMS","Fuzzy systems; Industrial management; Industry; Refining; Aggregation techniques; Design/methodology/approach; Fuzzy cognitive map; Information security investment; Information security managements; Information security requirements; ISMS; Security implementations; Security of data"

Information technology is rapidly changing, is inherently complex, and complexity kills security. There is an ongoing technical race to maintain security that does not take into account the human factors. The new technological infrastructure affects the degree of anonymity and confidentiality in mass-market computer-based systems and basically determines the evolution of democratic-political culture. Thus, in examining the issue of security, cryptography, privacy in the use of computers and Internet, forms the primary interest form the moral side of view, about what is the right and wrong thing to do, rather than in a legal frame, about what is legal and illegal. Security and privacy are not ethical or moral issues. They are fundamental human rights. In this societal change, the challenges of the information society are many but foremost is the protection of human rights. Addressing the critical question of how technological trends are both helping and hindering the advancement of human rights is essential in the specific digital environment. The democratic key concept is the efficient use of digital resources. We do not only need a culture of security (information), we further need to ensure the security of cultures, meaning that everyone should be able to freely exercise their constitutional rights. The role of this chapter is to bring to the surface the rights (human) implications of ICT and the information society. It enlightens the technical community, which designs, implements, and secures information and communication systems, with an understanding of human rights principles and foundational underpinnings. It highlights the role of government implications, identifies the role and relationship between the stakeholders, and indicates the balance between information security and freedom in order to understand that security, freedom, and rights (human), are not opposite concepts but coexist and progress in parallel. © 2013, IGI Global.","",""

Since this algorithm can utilize the rechargeable battery more efficiently and reasonably, the metered load will be maintained at stable states for a longer time period.

Steganalysis is a methodology of detecting messages hidden using steganography. In this paper, a visual steganalysis method has been proposed. Secret text messages can be detected by using frequency domain characteristics of stego audio data which contain text messages. Experimental results show that if stego object contains text messages and it is encoded by LSB or its varieties, some remarkable changes can be observed in frequency domain characteristics and its spectrogram. Thanks to exploring these frequency domain characteristics of stego objects, steganalysis (stego text detection) on audio data can be visually realized.","Audio steganography; Data hiding; Information security; Steganalysis","Data visualization; Frequency domain analysis; Frequency hopping; Security of data; Telephone systems; Art and science; Audio steganography; Data hiding; Frequency domains; Information hiding; Least significant bits; Sender and receivers; Steganalysis; Steganography"

On the other hand, existing security assessment methods typically focus on modeling the active attacker (e.g., attack graphs), but many rely on restrictive models that are not readily applicable to complex (e.g., cyber-physical or cyber-human) systems. By ""going with the flow,"" our assessment framework can naturally adopt a holistic view of such systems, unifying information about system components, their properties, and possible attacks to argue about a security goal. The argument is expressed in a graph structure, based on inputs from several distinct classes that are integrated in a systematic manner. That rigorous structure allows our approach to provide quantitative assessment in an automated fashion (like reliability assessment tools and attack graphs), while maintaining a broad assessment scope.

There are many possible causes of information leakage, such as inadequate precautions during the programming process, which lead to the leakage of e-mail addresses entered online or insufficient protection of database information, a loophole that enables malicious users to steal online content. In this paper, we implement a crawler mining system that is equipped with SQL injection vulnerability detection, by means of an algorithm developed for the web crawler. In addition, we analyze portal sites of the governments of various countries or regions in order to investigate the information leaking status of each site.

In this paper we focus on one open challenge-the limited understanding in the community of the types of knowledge these games help to develop. Using a taxonomy that distinguishes between declarative, procedural and conditional knowledge, we evaluate a game-based toolkit to analyse and solve an information security problem within a holistic crime prevention framework. Twenty-eight participants used the toolkit. We designed a portfolio of learning assessment measures to capture learning of different types of knowledge. The measures included two theoretical open-answer questions to explore participants' understanding, three problem-specific open-answer questions to test their ability to apply the framework, and 9 multiple-choice questions to test their ability to transfer what was learned to other contexts. The assessment measures were administered before and after use of the tookit. The application questions were analysed by classifying suggested ideas. The theoretical questions were qualitatively analysed using a set of analytical techniques. The transferability questions were statistically analysed using t-tests. Our results show that participants' answers to the application questions improved in quality after the use of the toolkit. In their answers to the theoretical questions most participants could explain the key features of the toolkit. Statistical analysis of the multiple-choice questions testing transferability however failed to demonstrate significant improvement.

These logs often contain high volumes of interesting and useful information about activities in the network, and are among the first data sources that information security specialists consult when they suspect that an attack has taken place. However, security products often come from a patchwork of vendors, and are inconsistently installed and administered. They generate logs whose formats differ widely and that are often incomplete, mutually contradictory, and very large in volume. Hence, although this collected information is useful, it is often dirty. We present a novel system, Beehive, that attacks the problem of automatically mining and extracting knowledge from the dirty log data produced by a wide variety of security products in a large enterprise. We improve on signature-based approaches to detecting security incidents and instead identify suspicious host behaviors that Beehive reports as potential security incidents. These incidents can then be further analyzed by incident response teams to determine whether a policy violation or attack has occurred. We have evaluated Beehive on the log data collected in a large enterprise, EMC, over a period of two weeks. We compare the incidents identified by Beehive against enterprise Security Operations Center reports, antivirus software alerts, and feedback from enterprise security specialists. We show that Beehive is able to identify malicious events and policy violations which would otherwise go undetected.","","Security of data; Security systems; Antivirus softwares; Enterprise networks; Enterprise security; Incident response; Large enterprise; Security incident; Security products; Signature-based approach; Industry"

Many organizations introduce security risk management to ensure the security of business processes. However, in the processes of risk assessment, it is difficult and time-consuming to identify the threats and vulnerabilities for each asset. Furthermore, if the identified results diverged from the real situation, the organization may implement unnecessary controls to prevent the non-existing risk. In order to resolve these problems, we adopt data mining approach to find the relationship between asset and threat-vulnerability. And then, we propose a recommendation scheme for assisting user identifying threat and vulnerability. The experiment result shows that our recommendation mechanism can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the risk assessment. © 2013 IEICE.","Data mining; Recommendation; Threat; Vulnerability","Data mining; Risk management; Security of data; Virtual reality; Business operation; Information security risk assessment; Recommendation; Recommendation mechanism; Security risk managements; Threat; Threats and vulnerabilities; Vulnerability; Risk assessment"

Recently two RFID authentication protocols named ESAP and WISP for RFID security authentication are designed based on the monotonically increasing time-stamp. Message exchange becomes much more dynamical and anonymous in these two protocols because of the time-stamp. However they are vulnerable to the timing attack and the counterfeit attacks. Inspired by the monotonically increasing time-stamp mechanism in the two protocols, we present a novel mutual security authentication protocol TMAP which can resist tag counterfeit attack, reader counterfeit attack, replay attack and de-synchronization attack, especially the timing attack. The protocol TMAP provides mutual authentication for the server and the reader, decreases the computation both of the tag and the server and operates in the mobile RFID systems, which is promising practical application especially in the mobile Internet and cloud computing developing rapidly nowadays. © 2013 IEEE.","authentication protocol; privacy; RFID; security; time-stamp","Authentication; Computer crime; Crime; Data privacy; Mobile phones; Optical communication; Security of data; Authentication protocols; De-synchronization attacks; Mutual authentication protocols; Rfid authentication protocols; security; Security and privacy issues; Security authentication; Time-stamp; Radio frequency identification (RFID)"

We focus on theoretical and algorithmic foundations of multiscale graphs, coming from an algorithmic perspective, with the goal of modeling cyber system defense as a specific use case scenario. We first define a notion of multiscale graphs, in contrast with their well-studied single-scale counterparts. We develop multiscale analogs of paths and distance metrics. As a simple, motivating example of a common metric, we present a multiscale analog of the all-pairs shortest-path problem, along with a multiscale analog of a well-known algorithm which solves it. From a cyber defense perspective, this metric might be used to model the distance from an attacker's position in the network to a sensitive machine. In addition, we investigate probabilistic models of connectivity. These models exploit the hierarchy to quantify the likelihood that sensitive targets might be reachable from compromised nodes. We believe that our novel multiscale approach to modeling cyber-physical systems will advance several aspects of cyber defense, specifically allowing for a more efficient and agile approach to defending these systems. © 2013 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Embedded systems; National security; Network security; Security systems; Algorithmic foundations; All pairs shortest paths; Compromised nodes; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Multi-scale approaches; Probabilistic models; Situational awareness; Use case scenario; Models"

Although it offers tremendous opportunities, there are some major challenges, such as security, that must be solved for efficient usage. Confidentiality is one of the most important points of information security especially in financial, governmental and military usage. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers and untrusted employees. The proposed approach is built as an improvement on an existing model, which is called AdjointVM. In this model, it is aimed to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, the defenselessness of the protection architecture, and to build a more secure cloud environment for users. In AdjointVM, to protect the VM, there have to be two configured VMs: the protected VM and the protector VM. These VMs are connected in a circular chain to monitor intrusions. Unlike AdjointVM, in which the number of running VMs is proportional to the number of VMs that have to be protected, in the proposed model, this number remains the same, and this results in a decrease in the capital expenditure (capex). © 2013 IEEE.","AdjointVM; cloud computing; intrusion detection; security; trusted computing; virtual machine","Artificial intelligence; Chains; Information science; Intrusion detection; Network architecture; AdjointVM; Capital expenditures; Cloud environments; Hybrid approach; Protection architecture; security; Trusted computing; Virtual machines; Cloud computing"

We then discuss some of the limitations of the current models, which we highlight by conducting a case study involving the modelling of an Access Control mechanism used by a leading telecommunications company. To overcome such limitations, we present an extension of the STRBAC model which considers the physical aspects of Access Control systems.

Attacks on critical information systems and infrastructure are not solely network, or malware, or single disks; they are coordinated, large-scale multisite attacks done in an organized manner. With the increase in frequency and sophistication of these attacks, it is not enough to rely on intrusion detection systems, trusted IT staff, or organizational information security divisions. The velocity of a cyber attack should be met with an equally coordinated response. There is a need to develop a platform that enables responders to establish trust and develop an effective collaborative response plan and investigation process across multiple organizations and legal bodies to track adversaries, mitigate the threat, get critical systems back online, and pursue legal action against the offenders. In this work we propose such a platform for efficient collaboration. Our work is informed by our practices in supporting law enforcement organizations dealing with large-scale distributed attacks on critical information systems and infrastructure and by an examination of Stuxnet, a computer worm discovered in June 2010 that is believed to have been created by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Based on these experiences of operational support, the authors propose Cerebro, an Extensible Large-Scale Analysis Platform designed to fuse structured domain specific information, decision support, and collaboration in an automated fashion, to effectively detect and respond to such attacks. © 2013 IEEE.","digital intelligence; digital investigations; incident response; multi-site collaboration; multi-site coordination; network security","Computer crime; Decision support systems; Information systems; National security; Network security; Online systems; Security of data; Security systems; digital intelligence; Digital investigation; Domain-specific information; Incident response; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-site; Multiple organizations; Organizational information; Critical infrastructures"

However, diagnosing the risk of an information system requires special expertise, which could be costly and difficult to acquire. The MSSP may exploit their professional advantage and provide fraudulent diagnosis of clients' vulnerabilities. Such an incentive to mis-represent clients' risks is often called the credence goods problem in the economics literature[3]. Although different mechanisms have been introduced to tackle the credence goods problem, in the information security outsourcing context, such mechanisms may not work well with the presence of system interdependency risks [6], which are introduced by inter-connecting multiple clients' systems by the MSSP. In particular, we find that allowing clients to seek alternative diagnosis of their vulnerabilities may not remove the MSSP's fraudulent behaviors. We shall explore alternative ways to solve the credence goods problem in the information security outsourcing context. © International Financial Cryptography Association 2013.","Credence good; Information security outsourcing; Interdependency risks","Cryptography; Information systems; Outsourcing; Credence good; Different mechanisms; Interdependency risks; Managed security service providers; Multiple clients; credence good; Security of data"

Emergency operations personnel at chemical weapons stockpile sites within the continental United States know exactly what to do. They rely on WebPuff, a state-of-the-art decision support system sponsored by the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Activity (CMA)1 and developed by IEM, a security consulting firm based in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park. WebPuff is used by military and civilian jurisdictions within the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), which is jointly managed by the U.S. Army and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). WebPuff provides users at CSEPP sites with a suite of planning and response tools that are integrated with a unique chemical dispersion model that provides an advanced level of science on which decisions about public protection can be based. Incorporating real-time and forecast weather, topography data, and current toxicity standards, WebPuff's dispersion model provides the most realistic plume prediction in less than two minutes - enabling military installations to meet a five-minute criterion for notifying civilian jurisdictions of an impending threat. WebPuff's chemical dispersion model has been independently tested and certified by scientists at Dugway Proving Ground [1, 2]. WebPuff incorporates a shared framework for risk management among independently managed military and civil jurisdictions at each site as well as a common understanding of how to plan for and, if necessary, respond to the threat that faces communities around chemical weapons stockpile sites every day. In developing the system, CMA and IEM gained consensus from both military and civilian users on operational requirements, business rules, and detailed designs for reports and computer displays that are foundational to the system. WebPuff provides users with information that is organized - primarily through visual means - around a common understanding of the threat and a common concept of operations. Moreover, it is a cost-effective solution to emergency preparedness and response because it is built using 100% open-source technology - the customer pays no third-party license fees. The system meets Department of Defense security and interoperability requirements - military bases using the system can communicate securely and effectively with civilian emergency management organizations. As a result, WebPuff is Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) certified with a current Authority to Operate (ATO) on Army networks. To ensure interoperability with civilian jurisdictions, the system uses the Emergency Data eXchange Language (EDXL) Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) developed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). Nearly ten years after its fielding, WebPuff continues to evolve to meet emerging standards and operational concepts and CSEPP communities are still using the system. Its ability to provide trusted results quickly and to truly facilitate cooperation and collaboration among diverse organizations during disaster response has been, and continues to be, the key to its success. While WebPuff was originally designed to support preparedness for chemical weapons accidents, it represents a unique framework, models, and components that can be customized and extended for use with other hazards and other concepts of operations. © 2013 IEEE.","data visualizaiton; decision making; information management; information sharing; integrated decision support; preparedness; risk assessment; Situaitonal awareness; situational underdtanding","Accidents; Accreditation; Artificial intelligence; Chemical warfare; Civil defense; Decision making; Decision support systems; Disasters; Dispersions; Electronic data interchange; Information management; Management science; Military bases; National security; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security systems; Weather forecasting; data visualizaiton; Information sharing; Integrated decision; preparedness; Situaitonal awareness; situational underdtanding; Interoperability"

This dependency results in exposure to new threats and vulnerabilities that dramatically increase operational risk. Executive management is ultimately responsible for insuring that this risk is properly managed to assure organizational health, profitability, and compliance with all laws and regulations. Challenges in discharging this responsibility include difficulty in understanding undesirable events on organizational objectives, lack of modeling controls across multiple interdependent domains, and the tendency to allocate resources for security with a tactical view, rather than a strategic view, of the organization.

Nevertheless, they are subject to many requirements such as real-time constraints, energy limitations, and security requirements for the communications. Energy Harvesting is a new paradigm in WSNs: sensor nodes are powered by energy harvested from the ambient, rather than by non-rechargeable batteries which permits a potentially perpetual operation. However, energy harvesting poses new challenges in the design of WSNs, in that energy availability fluctuates over the time. In this paper, we investigate the following fundamental question: how should the harvested energy be managed to guarantee data security in all circumstances? Our contributions in this paper are twofold: First, we propose the Deadline Mechanism to dynamically cope with energy shortage and guarantee the highest possible quality of protection by the use of different encryption algorithms. Second, we design a new chaos based cryptosystem suitable for WSNs. Indeed, the proposed encryption/decryption scheme is robust against all known attacks. Experiments show that it is at least 7 times faster than the AES algorithm and also, faster than many chaos based cryptosystems of the literature. Our objective is to identify low-complexity policies that achieve close-to-optimal performance, in terms of maximizing the average long-term importance of the reported data. © 2013 IEEE.","Chaos based crypto-system; Information security; Quality of service; Real-time; Reliability; Scheduling; Secure transactions","Energy harvesting; Internet; Quality of service; Reliability; Scheduling; Security of data; Sensor nodes; Chaos-based cryptosystem; Energy harvesting sensors; Low-complexity policies; Quality of protections; Real time constraints; Real-time; Secure transactions; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Cryptography"

This capability is referred to as digital forensic readiness and aims to maximize the forensic credibility of digital evidence, while minimizing its post-incident forensic investigation. In this paper, we classify forensic investigation frameworks to expose gaps in proactive forensics research and we review three prominent information security incidents with regard to proactive forensics planning.

Moreover, risks evolve rapidly in today's connected digital world. The proper management of information security, therefore, requires automation of the various monitoring, analysis, and control processes.

Integrity between local storages and the clouds is a critical issue which often messes up the SMBs' digital assets in a hybrid cloud environment. The downside makes SMBs reluctant to embrace cloud technology, though they may benefit from it in the long-term. The drawback comes from two aspects: ""the information chaos"" and ""the management crisis."" The chaos originates from the possibility of information inconsistency among replicas in different places. The managerial crisis lies in the non-trustable access to the digital assets. This research aims to solve the Hybrid Cloud security control issues such as Identity Authentication as well as Access Right Authorization and consequent Synchronization of the file contents. The research refers to the de facto open standards, viz. OpenID and O'Auth to facilitate Account Authentication and Access Right Authorization etc for the Hybrid Cloud environment. The mechanisms are implemented for a cross-platform which encompasses Linux-based local hosts as well as MS-Windows- based computers, the private cloud based on Hadoop, and the Google Apps as the public cloud scenario. Users can launch the login from whatever a local host and then Google Apps, Facebook, etc., can deal with Access Right Permissions on the respective clouds. At last, we validate, according to CMMI, the functionality, reliability and integrity of the solutions to show the superiority and applicability of our approach.","Access right management; ACL (access control list); Hybrid cloud; Information security; Synchronization","Computer operating systems; Security of data; Synchronization; Access control lists; Access rights; Business information; Cloud technologies; File synchronization; Higher efficiency; Hybrid clouds; Identity authentication; Authentication"

However, given that considerable information on individuals and companies are identified in the cloud, concerns have been raised regarding the safety of the cloud environment. Despite the hype surrounding cloud computing, customers remain reluctant to deploy their commercial enterprise into the cloud. Nevertheless, lack of protection is the only major concern that hinders increased use of cloud computing. Furthermore, the complexity with which cloud computing manages data secrecy, and information security makes the market hesitant about cloud computing. The architecture of cloud models threatens the security of existing technologies when deployed in a cloud environment. Thus, users of cloud services should know the dangers of uploading data into this new environment.

In this paper, we propose a flexible and dynamic network access control system for the virtual desktop environment. When a user tries to login to the virtual desktop environment, the proposed mechanism automatically configures the user's network access policy based on the user's authority and the assigned virtual desktop IP address. In contrast to the existing methods, this proposed mechanism satisfies the scenario of dynamic IP address assignment.

Big data rise in response to the proper time and conditions to offer advantages for the nodes in supply chains to solve prewiously difficult problems. For any big data project to succeed, it must first depend on high-quality data but not merely on quantity. Further, it will become increasingly important in many big data projects to add external data to the mix and companies will eventually turn from only looking inward to also looking outward into the market, which means the use of big data must be broadened considerably. Hence the data supply chains, both internally and externally, become of prime importance. ICT (Information and Telecommunication) supply chain management is especially important as supply chain link the world closely and ICT supply chain is the base of all supply chains in today's world. Though many initiatives to supply chain security have been developed and taken into practice, most of them are emphasized in physical supply chain which is addressed in transporting cargos. The research on ICT supply chain security is still in preliminary stage. The use of big data can promote the normal operation of ICT supply chain as it greatly improve the data collecting and processing capacity and in turn, ICT supply chain is a necessary carrier of big data as it produces all the software, hardware and infrastructures for big data's collection, storage and application. The close relationship between big data and ICT supply chain make it an effective way to do research on big data security through analysis on ICT supply chain security. This paper first analyzes the security problems that the ICT supply chain is facing in information management, system integrity and cyberspace, and then introduces several famous international models both on physical supply chain and ICT supply chain. After that the authors describe a case of communication equipment with big data in ICT supply chain and propose a series of recommendations conducive to developing secure big data supply chain from five dimensions. © 2013 IEEE.","Big data; Cyberattacks; ICT supply chain model; Information security; System integrity","Application programs; Data acquisition; Data communication equipment; Digital storage; Information management; Information technology; Models; Supply chain management; Big datum; Communication equipments; Cyber-attacks; International model; Processing capacities; Supply chain modeling; Supply chain security; System integrity; Security of data"

The rhythm recognition algorithm is able to identify the rhythm sequence tapped on the screen, extracting rhythm features and creating the keys. Through testing, the new scheme can better match the rhythm gestures and improve the information security greatly.

Information Security Policies (ISPs) are among these solutions. ISPs require organizational members to conform to security measures but individuals often fail to comply with them. While prior studies investigated several factors leading to compliance, the effect of religiosity on intention to comply with ISP (ICISP) has been overlooked. This research, therefore, studies the role of religiosity and conservation value in addition to existing factors. The proposed model is tested with students in universities in Ethiopia and USA to obtain a wide array of religious beliefs. The findings show subjective norm and religiosity indirectly but positively affects ICISP via attitude. They also show direct positive effect of religiosity on ICISP. Contrary to prior studies, conservative-value affects ICISP positively; and, when moderated by religiosity, the relationship becomes stronger.

In recent years, the research interest of many scholars engaged in coding theory have been transferred to the finite ring. Researches on MacWilliams identities over finite rings have not only important theory meanings but also important practical value. Many achievements about the weight distribution of the code over the ring have been made. Let R = Fp+uFp+...+uk-1Fp. In this study, the MacWilliams identities of the R-linear codes are discussed. Firstly, the complete weight enumerator and the symmetrized weight enumerator of R-linear codes are defined. Secondly, the complete weight MacWilliams identity and the symmetrized weight MacWilliams identity are given by using a special variable t.

Organizations implement security controls in order to motivate employees. Many control-related motivations have been explored in information security research (e.g., self-efficacy and behavioral control); however, self-determination has yet to receive attention. Selfdetermination theory is widely used in other fields to explain intrinsically driven performance. This paper examines the effect self-determination-conceptualized as reflective autonomy, and psychological reactance-conceptualized as reactive autonomy have on employees' intentions to comply with security policy. Reflective and reactive autonomy offer complementary yet opposite conceptualizations of autonomy, offering a more holistic view of control-related motivation. We find that both reflective and reactive autonomy affect information security policy compliance intentions. Reflective autonomy increases and reactive autonomy decreases compliance intentions. Managers should become aware of the way employees view security controls in order to develop controls that maximize reflective autonomy and minimize reactive autonomy in employees. © (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","Autonomy; Information security; Policy compliance; Reactance; Self-determination","Control theory; Human resource management; Information systems; Motivation; Security of data; Security systems; Autonomy; Behavioral control; Information security policies; Policy compliance; Reactance; Security controls; Self-determination; Self-determination theories; Compliance control"

The implementation of electronic health records systems is a critical part of an eHealth system. Despite the potential gains, there are several obstacles that limit the wider development of electronic health record systems. Among these are the perceived threats to the security and privacy of patients' health data, and a widely held belief that these cannot be adequately addressed. We hypothesize that the major concerns regarding eHealth security and privacy cannot be overcome through the implementation of technology alone. Human dimensions must be considered when analyzing the provision of the three fundamental information security goals: confidentiality, integrity and availability. A sociotechnical analysis to establish the information security and privacy requirements when designing and developing a given eHealth system is important and timely. A framework that accommodates consideration of the legislative requirements and human perspectives in addition to the technological measures is useful in developing a measurable and accountable eHealth system. Successful implementation of this approach would enable the possibilities, practicalities and sustainabilities of proposed eHealth systems to be realised. © 2013 IEEE.","eHealth; Electronic Health Record; Information Accountability; Information Security; Privacy; Sociotechnical",""

Visual Cryptography is basically a cryptographic method in which decryption is performed by human visual system. In this paper, we present a novel visual cryptography scheme based on a substitution cipher and random grid. The scheme uses two-fold encryption. In the first fold of encryption, Caeser cipher is used to encrypt the image row wise and then column wise using a key of the size equal to the greatest common devisor of the number of rows and columns in the secret image. Then a random matrix is generated and the transformed secret image is XORed with this random matrix to enhance the security. The scheme is shown to be secure and decryption is also lossless. © 2013 IEEE.","Data Hiding; One Time Pad; Substitution Cipher; Visual Secret Sharing","Data processing; Security of data; Cryptographic methods; Cryptographic techniques; Data hiding; Information communication; One time pads; Substitution ciphers; Visual cryptography schemes; Visual secret sharing; Cryptography"

The vocabulary is compatible with existing terminology for Information Operations (IO), as well as for such modeling and analysis techniques as Red Team analysis, game-theoretic modeling, attack tree and attack graph modeling, and analysis based on the cyber attack lifecycle. We use this vocabulary to map cyber resiliency techniques to the different phases of a cyber campaign. This use of the vocabulary enables the identification of measures of effectiveness (MOEs) or metrics for effects on adversary activities. The mapping also illuminates how cyber resiliency techniques apply differently to address various adversary activities, and thus provides a basis for identifying effective combinations of techniques. © 2013 IEEE.","advanced persistent threat; computer security; cyber security; information security; mission assurance; resilience","Intrusion detection; National security; Security of data; Trees (mathematics); advanced persistent threat; Cyber security; Game-theoretic model; Information operations; Measures of effectiveness; Mission assurances; Operational decisions; resilience; Security systems"

Popular systems, such as Tor and JAP, achieve anonymity by forwarding the traffic through a sequence of relays. In particular, Tor protocol constructs a circuit of typically 3 relays such as no single relay knows both the source and destination of the traffic. A known attack on Tor consists in injecting a set of compromised relays and wait until a Tor client picks two of them as entry (first) and exit (last) relays. With the currently large number of relays, this attack is not scalable anymore. In this paper, we take advantage of the presence of unpopular ports in Tor network to significantly increase the scalability of the attack: instead of injecting typical Tor relays (with the default exit policy), we inject only relays allowing unpopular ports. Since only a small fraction of Tor relays allow unpopular ports, the compromised relays will outnumber the valid ones. We show how Tor traffic can be redirected through unpopular ports. The experimental analysis shows that by injecting a relatively small number of compromised relays (30 pairs of relays) allowing a certain unpopular port, more than 50% of constructed circuits are compromised. © 2013 IEEE.","Anonymity Systems; Censorship; Information Security; Network Security; Privacy; Tor Network","Data privacy; Distributed computer systems; Hardware; Security of data; Censorship; Experimental analysis; In networks; Tor networks; Network security"

As engineering educators whose academic focus is information assurance and cyber security, we believe students in cyber security need the same type of access to hands on opportunities as their counter parts in hardware design or circuit design. Students should be able to configure and run their own networks, as well as explore the vulnerabilities, exploits, and remediatios needed in a cyber security professional's tool kit. Further, they need exposure to working in the complexity of the Internet. While some might argue that simulation software could be a solution, it often lacks realism. In this paper we show how our institution goes beyond the providing the standard, formalized laboratory activities for our cyber security students by developing a unique, highly configurable testbed called Internet-Scale Event and Attack Generation Environment (ISEAGE - pronounced ""ice age"") that allows us to imitate the Internet. ISEAGE provides a controlled environment that allows real attacks to be played out against the students' networks and demonstrates to them real world security concepts. This paper provides an overview of how the ISEAGE security testbed functions, as well as illustrates how ISEAGE provides our students five different types of opportunities for real world experience: support of formalized classroom work; cyber defense competitions for high school, community college and four year students; inquiry-based learning in a playground environment for high school, as well as college students; testing environment for network devices such as firewalls, data loss protection, intrusion detection; research environment for senior and graduate student work. © 2013 IEEE.","Cyber security; Information assurance education; Laboratory exercises; Testbed","Complex networks; Computer software; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Engineering research; Internet; Intrusion detection; Testbeds; Controlled environment; Cyber security; Engineering and technology; Information assurance; Information assurance education; Inquiry-based learning; Laboratory exercise; Real-world experience; Students"

Given the complexities involved, identifying the most appropriate measures to counteract the latter threats is highly challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel simulation-optimization method that tackles this problem. It combines rich conceptual modeling of security knowledge with discrete event simulation and metaheuristic optimization techniques. By simulating attacks, the method infers possible routes of attack and identifies emergent weaknesses while accounting for adversaries' heterogeneous objectives, capabilities, and available modes of entry. The optimization iteratively adapts the system model by means of a genetic algorithm and optimizes its ability to detect ongoing attacks and prevent their successful execution.

The motor vehicle electrical identification system is mainly composed of the tag, the reader and other aspects. Usually, the vehicle information, including the license number, the traveler name, the identification number and other personal information, is stored in the tag. Considering the radio communication between the tag and the reader, the personal security may be destroyed if the vehicle information is leaked. Therefore, this paper introduces a new process about reading and writing the tag of motor vehicle electrical identification system. Firstly, it designed the structure about the storage of the tag, including the information security area, the controlling area and the information area. Then, it proposed the method about reading and writing each area. Experimental results show that the proposed method can satisfy the command needing of the traffic management. © 2013 APSIPA.","","Advanced traffic management systems; Data processing; Security of data; Traffic control; Vehicles; Identification number; Information security area; Intelligent transport systems; Motor vehicle; Personal information; Personal security; RFID Technology; Traffic management; Radio frequency identification (RFID)"

But when it comes to managing employee's information security behaviour, many organisations still use policies proscribing behaviour and sanctioning non-compliance. Whilst many organisations are aware that this ""comply or die"" approach does not work for modern enterprises where employees collaborate, share, and show initiative, they do not have an alternative approach to fostering secure behaviour. We present an interview analysis of 126 employees' reasons for not complying with organisational policies, identifying the perceived conflict of security with productive activities as the key driver for non-compliance and confirm the results using a survey of 1256 employees. We conclude that effective problem detection and security measure adaptation needs to be de-centralised - employees are the principal agents who must decide how to implement security in specific contexts. But this requires a higher level of security awareness and skills than most employees currently have. Any campaign aimed at security behaviour needs to transform employee's perception of their role in security, transforming them to security-aware principal agents. © International Financial Cryptography Association 2013.","Compliance; Decision-making; Information security management","Cryptography; Command-and-control; Compliance; Employee's perceptions; Information security behaviours; Information security managements; Interview analysis; Problem detection; Security awareness; compliance; Security of data"

However, in most cases, this increases the length of the data, thus it increases the cost. When it is desired to transmit data over an insecure and bandwidth-constrained channel, it is customary to compress the data first and then encrypt it. In this paper, a novel algorithm, the new compression with encryption and compression (CEC), is proposed to secure and compress the data. This algorithm compresses the data to reduce its length. The compressed data is encrypted and then further compressed using a new encryption algorithm without compromising the compression efficiency and the information security. This CEC algorithm provides a higher compression ratio and enhanced data security.

The security is the most important concepts that must be considered in computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system. Our approach in comparison to the previous methods which model the behavior of the attacker and IDS, models the system and attacker as two-players, non-cooperative game. We conduct our model on the famous data set in security area and obtained result is promising. © 2013 IEEE.","Attacker cost; Component; Intrusion detection system; Nash Equilibrium; Sensor cost","Computer crime; Costs; Damage detection; Network security; Component; Game-theoretic; Intrusion Detection Systems; Nash equilibria; Noncooperative game; Security problems; Security tools; System administrators; Game theory"

There are already tens of thousands of medical apps available for download, to educate both patients and trainees, and many more are being designed to facilitate delivery of care. The rapid development of this technology has outgrown its quality evaluation and regulation, both urgently required to maintain patient safety, protect sensitive data, and ensure dissemination of accurate information. We review medical apps themed towards cardiothoracic surgery in terms of medical professional involvement in their content and design. Methods iTunes and Play Store were searched for cardiothoracic surgery-themed medical apps, using the terms cardiothoracic, thoracic, cardiac, heart, lung, surgery, and variations thereof and including the term medical. Results A focused search yielded 379 apps, of which 6% were associated with a named medical professional, 15% with a publisher or professional society, and 63% with a user rating. Conclusions The findings suggest inadequate input from the medical profession. The article discusses the pressing issues regarding quality evaluation, regulation, and information security, required for smartphones and handheld devices to become an integral and safe part of delivery of care.

This paper presents a novel mission assurance policy that adapts to the dynamic security status of all mission assets to quickly and automatically determine mission assurance level and to decide what changes are needed accordingly. The novelty of this mission assurance policy stems from using a time Petri net model for determining the security status of cyber assets, and then employing binary or multi-valued logic decision diagrams to assess the mission assurance level. The ability of a mission assurance policy to successfully complete its objectives depends mainly on whether a risk management scheme is provided to reduce risk to an acceptable level. To that end, this paper also describes a risk management scheme to systematically deal with the main factors of risk management such as the temporal interdependencies of cyber assets, impact of attacks, and risk mitigation. Given that the status of cyber assets changes due to the dynamic cybersecurity environment of asset vulnerabilities, threats, and recovery, the proposed mission assurance policy and risk management scheme enable decision makers to cope with the real-time assessment of mission assurance level. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).","Cyber assets; Decision diagrams; Mission assurance; Policy; Resilience; Risk management; Time Petri net","decision making; Internet; real time; risk assessment; security threat; social policy; vulnerability"

This paper first introduces 3D GIS technological developments and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of leading 3D GIS products applied in digital pipelines at home and abroad, including universal GIS platform, 3D design products, and real-time visual driver. And the significance was analyzed of the independent 3D GIS products for oil and gas storage's security assurance from the information security perspective. Also, it introduced in detail the design idea, framework and functional features of the Professional Pipeline 3D GIS Platform (RAY-PIPE) with independent intellectual property rights. Based on case histories in the Sinopec's Sichuan-to-East China Pipeline Project, the functions and their characteristics of this platform were discussed in the following aspects: integrity data management, station visual management, production visual monitoring with alarm linkage, pipeline integrity assessment result display, safety and emergency management. Then it summarizes the significantly strategic promotion effects brought about by the independently-developed 3D GIS technology applied to oil and gas pipeline integrity management. In addition, it also points out that information integration, dispatch control, rsource allocation, risk control and emergency rescue can be all realized on the same platform. With this tool, the management level and working efficiency are both significantly improved; also, mass data can be collected for the PIM and thereby huge lessons and experience will be provided for cutting down the engineering cost and preparing for the following optimized pipeline management. Finally, from the perspectives of Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT), a broad prospect was described for the 3D GIS platform applications in the field of oil and gas storage and transportation.","3D GIS; Digital pipeline; Information security; Oil and gas pipeline; Pipeline integrity management; RAY-PIPE","Cost engineering; Gas pipelines; Information management; Intellectual property; Product design; Risk management; Security of data; Structural integrity; Emergency management; Information integration; Intellectual property rights; Internet of Things (IOT); Oil-and-Gas pipelines; Pipeline integrity management; RAY-PIPE; Technological development; Three dimensional"

Information security is realized by the integration of people, processes, and technology. In order to enhance the people's side of information security, we have been using digital video clips, which are produced by a group of faculty members of Japanese universities. In order to enhance the technology side of information security, we have been using a managed security service and other means. We could reach 24 hours a day and 365 days a year monitoring at the doorway of the university using the service. However, we had no standard means to enhance the process side of information security until recently. This deficiency became an obstacle to making agreements between other universities on inter-university activities. This need also may be an obstacle to gaining reliance from users. In order to cope with this problem, we have decided to implement an information security management system (ISMS). It takes a lot of time and work to implement the ISMS. However, many parts of the ISMS were processes that we were already doing without any clear rules. The ISMS helps not only enhance information security but also improve daily work and management of the staff.

There are two main reasons for this: 1) ADSs incur high false positives; 2) Are highly susceptible to evasion attacks (false negatives). While efforts have been made to minimize false positives, evasion is still an open problem. We argue that ADSs design is inherently flawed since it relies on the ADS's detection logic and feature space which is trivial to estimate. In information security e.g. cryptographic algorithms (such as DES), security is inherently dependent upon the key and not the algorithm, which makes these systems very robust by rendering evasion computationally infeasible. We believe there is a need to redesign the anomaly detection systems similar to cryptographic systems. We propose to randomize the feature space of an ADS such that it acts as a cryptographic key for the ADS and hence this randomized feature space is used by the ADS logic for detection of anomalies. This would make the evasion of the ADS computationally infeasible for the attacker. © 2013 Authors.","evasion; intrusion detection systems","Cryptography; Deceleration; Distributed computer systems; Security of data; Anomaly detection systems; Commercial deployment; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic key; Cryptographic systems; Design philosophy; evasion; Intrusion Detection Systems; Algorithms"

Traditionally, both decision and static game theoretical techniques are employed to characterize the strategies of firms and hackers. However, these techniques fail to capture the dynamic attribute of the risk environment, which is an increasingly important element, especially in modern distributed and complex computer and communication networks. Utilizing a differential game framework in which hackers disseminate security knowledge within a hacker population over time, this paper analyzes dynamic interactions between a firm endeavoring to protect its information assets and a hacker seeking to misappropriate them. In particular, we investigate three differential games in which the firm and the hacker move simultaneously and sequentially, respectively. We find that (a) the hacker invests the most in the simultaneous differential game, whereas the firm, as the leader, invests the most in the sequential differential game, and (b) both the firm and the hacker enjoy their highest payoffs in the sequential differential game with the hacker as the leader. Furthermore, it is numerically shown that in equilibrium, knowledge dissemination may not necessarily benefit the hacker and harm the firm. Some of our results are consistent with the findings of previous work, although the earlier results were obtained from a static game framework. Our main findings contrast with those of several previous studies that showed mixed results for comparisons between simultaneous and sequential games. © 2013 INFORMS.","Differential game; Equilibrium solution; Information security economics; Knowledge dissemination History",""

This allows for effective load balancing, but at the same time threatens consumers' privacy. Since the electricity provider only needs the characteristics of a region, not individuals, approaches like one by Mármol et al. suggest to aggregate data to protect consumer privacy. However, an implementation of such an approach also has to consider the legal and regulatory situation. In Germany, the technical guideline TR-03109 issued by the Federal Office for Information Security specifies demands which have to be fulfilled so that a smart meter gateway can be certified for use. These specifications imply limitations to the protocol design. Within this paper, we discuss the applicability of the method presented by Mármol et al. under consideration of the German Smart Metering guideline. Where conformity is not given, we offer a solution to overcome these restrictions by adapting their method and introduce a third party aggregator who does not have to be trusted. Our method comes with additional communication effort but behaves well in terms of memory and computational overhead. The achieved privacy level outreaches a purely pseudonymous value transmission. Also it does not contradict the postulations of TR-03109, making it an applicable choice for privacy protection in real-world smart metering systems. © 2013 ACM.","homomorphic encryption; information aggregation; privacy; smart grid","Data privacy; Electric measuring instruments; Gateways (computer networks); Security of data; Computational overheads; Consumer privacy; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Information aggregation; Privacy protection; Protocol design; Smart grid; Technical guidelines; Smart power grids"

Passwords are no longer sufficient, as threats against them increase in large quantity. With the growing use of internet to access information resources, government and private agencies are now moving to replace password-based user authentication with stronger, Two-factor authentication systems that strengthen information security. Two-factor authentication requires that two parts of data be accessible, each being from a different category. It is a secure identification process in which the user provides two means of recognition, one of which is normally a physical token, such as a card, and the other of which is typically something memorized, such as a password or PIN number. In general Cryptographic Smart Cards provide a secure, portable platform for this type of Two-factor authentication systems. However, these smart card cryptographic systems are vulnerable to traditional mathematical attacks such as Differential and Linear Cryptanalysis attacks. These attacks explore weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms that are represented as mathematical objects. Other form of cryptographic attacks like Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks, fault attacks, replay attacks, side channel attacks, etc also exists. Hence to overcome these attacks, a new generic framework ""Smart Crypto-Stegano Card"" is proposed in this paper to enhance Two-Factor Authentication that gives users a better way to provide enhanced security for different smart card applications.","Differential Power Analysis attacks; Linear Cryptanalysis attacks; Smart Crypto-Stegano Card; Two-Factor Authentication",""

Specifically, we analyze the new critical issues in these situations that can be used by an adversary to disable the operation of cloud computing environment. We then discuss different BE methods that applying in MCC, and explore scenarios where each method shows its strengths and weaknesses.

Computers have not only become important devices that people rely on in their daily lives and work, but have also become essential tools for enterprises. More and more enterprises have shifted their focus to how to prevent outer forces from invading and stealing from networks. However, many enterprises have disregarded the significance of internal leaking, which also plays a vital role in information management. This research proposes an information security management approach that is based on context-aware role-based access control (RBAC) and communication monitoring technology, in order to achieve enterprise information security management. In this work, it is suggested that an enterprise may, first, use an organizational chart to list job roles and corresponding permissions. RBAC is a model that focuses on different work tasks and duties. Subsequently, the enterprise may define a security policy to enforce the context-aware RBAC model. Finally, the enterprise may use communication monitoring technology in order to implement information security management. The main contribution of this work is the potential it provides to both reduce information security incidents, such as internal information leakage, and allow for effective cost control of information systems. © 2013 Mei-Yu Wu and Ming-Hsien Yu.","","Access control; Communication; Industrial management; Information management; Information technology; Context-Aware; Cost controls; Information leakage; Information security incidents; Information security managements; Monitoring technologies; Role-based Access Control; Security policy; Industry"

This paper studies the impact of integrity attacks on real-time pricing (RTP), a key feature of smart grids that uses such technologies to improve system efficiency. Recent studies have shown that RTP creates a closed loop formed by the mutually dependent real-time price signals and price-taking demand. Such a closed loop can be exploited by an adversary whose objective is to destabilize the pricing system. Specifically, small malicious modifications to the price signals can be iteratively amplified by the closed loop, causing inefficiency and even severe failures such as blackouts. This paper adopts a control-theoretic approach to deriving the fundamental conditions of RTP stability under two broad classes of integrity attacks, namely, the scaling and delay attacks. We show that the RTP system is at risk of being destabilized only if the adversary can compromise the price signals advertised to smart meters by reducing their values in the scaling attack, or by providing old prices to over half of all consumers in the delay attack. The results provide useful guidelines for system operators to analyze the impact of various attack parameters on system stability, so that they may take adequate measures to secure RTP systems. © 2013 ACM.","cyber security; real-time pricing; smart grid; stability","Convergence of numerical methods; Costs; Information technology; Smart power grids; System stability; Control-theoretic approach; Cyber security; Information and Communication Technologies; Integrity attacks; Real time pricing; Smart grid; System efficiency; Various attacks; Security of data"

One approach for overcoming this challenge is to utilize a dedicated proxy visible to all parties to mediate all communication between the nodes. The mediated data must be secure from end-to-end particularly in the context of surveillance systems due to the confidentiality of the data.

Hence, evaluating firewall platforms and their impact on network performance is important when assessing the effectiveness of network security. In this paper, we present an assessment methodol- ogy to analyze the performance of different firewalls platforms. The analysis considers the following metrics: delay, jitter, throughput, and packet loss. Moreover, the information security of the firewalls is also tested by applying a set of attacks and observing the reaction of the firewalls. The proposed assessment methodology is tested by performing real exper- iments on different types of firewalls including those that are personal and network-based.

Efficient healthcare is thus highly dependent on doctors being provided with access to patients' medical information at the right time and place. However it frequently happens that critical pieces of pertinent information end up not being used because they are located in information systems that do not inter-operate in a timely manner. Unfortunately the standard operational mode for many healthcare applications, and even healthcare institutions, is to be managed and operated as isolated islands that do not share information in an efficient manner. There are many reasons that contribute to this grim state of affairs, but what interests us the most is the lack of enforceable security policies for systems interoperability and data exchange and the existence of many heterogeneous legacy systems that are almost impossible to directly include into any reasonable secure interoperable workflow. In this paper we propose a RBAC mobile agent access control model supported by a specially managed public key infrastructure for mobile agent's strong authentication and access control. Our aim is to create the right means for doctors to be provided with timely accurate information, which would be otherwise inaccessible, by the means of strongly authenticated mobile agents capable of securely bridging otherwise isolated institutional eHealth domains and legacy applications. © 2013 IEEE.","Authentication; Health Information Systems (HIS); Information Security; Interoperability; Mobile agent; Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)","Authentication; Bioinformatics; Diagnosis; Electronic data interchange; Health care; Interoperability; Legacy systems; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Access control models; Health care application; Health care providers; Health information systems; Healthcare institutions; Public key infrastructure; Role-based Access Control; Systems interoperability; Mobile agents"

As such, Information security (IS) has become one of the most essential issues of data center security on the cloud computing, but we cannot rely solely on single solution to support all of the necessary features of IS. Therefore, we need to a new information security service model, called Security Operation Center (SOC). It can support online interactions and remote monitoring via network operations in data centers. The SOC is required to integrate related IS technologies based on security policies. In this paper, we propose the service level agreement (SLA) strategy for designing the SOC platform to meet the IS requirements of any organization in cloud computing. Therefore, the main purposes of this paper are to propose the framework of SLA strategy and the integration technology for designing an SOC platform. The SOC platform with SLA is to handle and supervise all the security service processes under different levels of cloud security enforcements according to data center scales, business properties, and existing IS functions. Consequently, the SLA strategy and integrating technology of IS can be the reference model for designing a proposed SOC platform in data centers on the cloud computing.","Cloud computing.; Data centers; IS; SLA; SOC","Network security; Data centers; Integrating technology; Integration technologies; IS; Security operation center; Service Level Agreements; SLA; SOC; Cloud computing"

However, 0/1 space hopping using the forward training method (FTM) may lead to interception when the training method and the space hopping pattern are both known to an eavesdropper. The backward training method with weight-feedback (BTM-WF), which can solve the above security problem, however, suffers from low efficiency and the feedback process. In this paper, backward training method with pre-compensation (BTM-PC) is proposed. The new method achieves higher efficiency by transmitting only one training symbol with all the antennas of the target receiver. Channel knowledge is acquired at the transmitter through training and used in pre-compensation. Thus the receiver can correctly receive information without any feedback, and then, through further adjustment, achieve the same performance as FTM and BTM-WF, while the eavesdropper always cannot intercept the information. The security of BTM-PC, as well as the influence of noise on the proposed method and the corresponding countermeasure, is also discussed in detail.

Many of the concerns, and the solutions put forward, will be remarkably familiar to current practitioners. Ideas about legislation for local records, national standards and central oversight of repositories, and appropriate training for archivists continue to be discussed, while information security scandals seem the only sure way of arousing general concern about good record-keeping.

We study estimation of energy systems when there is an adversarial attack on the sensed and communicated information.

At the same time, most studies on Twitter influence propagation focus on retweetability of tweets. In this paper, we propose the importance of Twitter's mention function as another method of message propagation. Specifically, we show that graphs constructed from Twitter's retweet, mention, and reply functions show structural differences suggesting that using the mention function is the most efficient method of reaching the mass audience. Moreover, we show that influencers are the most prominent on the mention graph. From these analysis we conclude that we need further research in the direction of non-traditional methods of population warning systems. Further, this is the first paper that characterizes the structural differences of the retweet/mention/reply graphs in Twitter. © 2013 IEEE.","Information retrieval; Information security; Social network services; Twitter","Information retrieval; Security of data; Emergency messages; Message propagation; Non-traditional; Social media; Social network services; Structural differences; Twitter; Social networking (online)"

First, object-oriented programs exhibit highly interprocedural, dynamically dispatched control structure. Second, the Android programming paradigm relies heavily on the asynchronous execution of multiple entry points. Existing analysis techniques focus more on the second challenge, while relying on traditional analytic techniques that suffer from inherent imprecision or unsoundness to solve the first. We present Anadroid, a static malware analysis framework for Android apps. Anadroid exploits two techniques to soundly raise precision: (1) it uses a pushdown system to precisely model dynamically dispatched interprocedural and exception-driven control-flow; (2) it uses Entry-Point Saturation (EPS) to soundly approximate all possible interleavings of asynchronous entry points in Android applications. (It also integrates static taint-flow analysis and least permissions analysis to expand the class of malicious behaviors which it can catch.) Anadroid provides rich user interface support for human analysts which must ultimately rule on the ""maliciousness"" of a behavior. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Anadroid's malware analysis, we had teams of analysts analyze a challenge suite of 52 Android applications released as part of the Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) DARPA program. The first team analyzed the apps using a version of Anadroid that uses traditional (finite-state-machine-based) control-flow-analysis found in existing malware analysis tools; the second team analyzed the apps using a version of Anadroid that uses our enhanced pushdown-based control-flow-analysis. We measured machine analysis time, human analyst time, and their accuracy in flagging malicious applications. With pushdown analysis, we found statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases in time: from 85 minutes per app to 35 minutes per app in human plus machine analysis time; and statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in accuracy with the pushdown-driven analyzer: from 71% correct identification to 95% correct identification. © 2013 ACM.","abstract interpretation; malware detection; pushdown systems; static analysis; taint analysis","Computer crime; Identification (control systems); Mobile devices; Robots; Smartphones; User interfaces; Abstract interpretations; Android applications; Asynchronous executions; Malware detection; Object-oriented program; Programming paradigms; Pushdown systems; taint analysis; Static analysis"

Medical diagnosis methods are based on images such as clinical radiographs, ultrasounds, CT scans, MRIs, or other imaging modalities. Information obtained from these images is correlated with patient information. So with regards to the important role of PACS in hospitals, we aimed to evaluate the PACS and survey the information security needed in the Radiological Information system. First, we surveyed the different aspects of PACS that should be in any health organizations based on Department of Health standards and prepared checklists for assessing the PACS in different hospitals. Second, we surveyed the security controls that should be implemented in PACS. Checklists reliability is affirmed by professors of Tehran Science University. Then, the final data are inputted in SPSS software and analyzed. The results indicate that PACS in hospitals can transfer patient demographic information but they do not show route of information. These systems are not open source. They don't use XML-based standard and HL7 standard for exchanging the data. They do not use DS digital signature. They use passwords and the user can correct or change the medical information. PACS can detect alternation rendered. The survey of results demonstrates that PACS in all hospitals has the same features. These systems have the patient demographic data but they do not have suitable flexibility to interface network or taking reports. For the privacy of PACS in all hospitals, there were passwords for users and the system could show the changes that have been made; but there was no water making or digital signature for the users. © 2013 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.","Information Security; Picture Archiving and Communications System; Radiological Information System","Computer Security; Confidentiality; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnostic Imaging; Female; Hospitals, State; Humans; Iran; Male; Medical Records; Radiology Information Systems; Security Measures; Authentication; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Hospitals; Information systems; Open systems; Population statistics; Radiology; Security of data; Surveys; Department of healths; Health organizations; Imaging modality; Medical information; Patient information; Picture archiving and communications systems; Security controls; XML-based standards; computer security; confidentiality; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; female; hospital; hospital information system; human; Iran; male; medical record; organization and management; review; standard; Medical applications"

In many applications, however, outsourcing these computations to an untrusted server is desirable, so that the server can perform the computation on behalf of the users. Unfortunately, existing solutions are either inefficient, rely heavily on user interaction, or require the inputs to be encrypted under the same public key - drawbacks making the employment in practice very limited. We propose a novel technique based on additively homomorphic encryption that avoids all these drawbacks. This method is efficient, requires no user interaction whatsoever (except for data upload and download), and allows evaluating any dynamically chosen function on inputs encrypted under different public keys. Our solution assumes the existence of two non-colluding but untrusted servers that jointly perform the computation by means of a cryptographic protocol. This protocol is proven to be secure in the semi-honest model. By developing application-tailored variants of our approach, we demonstrate its versatility and apply it in two real-world scenarios from different domains, privacy-preserving face recognition and private smart metering. We also give a proof-of-concept implementation to highlight its feasibility. © 2013 IEEE.","Homomorphic encryption; Information security; Secure multiparty computation; Secure outsourcing","Data privacy; Face recognition; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Cryptographic protocols; Different domains; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Multiparty computation; Privacy preserving; Real-world scenario; Secure multi-party computation; User interaction; Outsourcing"

To this day, most of the interaction between ATM centers is based on voice and point-to-point data communication. Speed and accuracy of coordination is thus frequently limited by human capacities. This also imposes severe restrictions on the scale of coordination efforts among ATM centers. There are, however, changes underway. The main ambition of the System-Wide Information Management (SWIM) concept is to realize a European-wide network of interconnected ATM systems that promises, among other things, to bring substantial gains in efficiency of coordination and improved utilization of valuable airspace.

In the past decade, this question has been the topic of several reports produced by international groups of experts in the field of conflict and security law. The most recent examples include the study on the notion of the 'direct participation in hostilities' under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Tallinn Manual on cyberwarfare prepared at the invitation of NATO. In this article, we discuss the Tallinn Manual, showing how experts faced with uncertainty as to the law's precise scope and meaning construct legal interpretations, legal definitions, and institutional facts and norms that can be used to make sense of a contingent world. At the same time, we argue, this absorption of uncertainty produces new uncertainty. Consequently, the power of experts does not reside in their knowledge, but in their control and management of uncertainty and non-knowledge.

In the fuzzy vault scheme, the biometric features are used to lock and unlock the secret key, which is encoded in the coefficients of a polynomial equation. Its security depends on the infeasibility of the polynomial reconstruction problem. Additionally, the vault performance can be enhanced by adding more noise (chaff) points to the vault. For a real-time implementation of the bio-cryptosystem, as would be required in today's information security system, existing methods for chaff generation is inadequate. This paper proposed and employed a new fast chaff point generation algorithm which is less time-consuming for producing more points to improve the performance and security of fingerprint fuzzy vault scheme. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster than existing algorithms and still satisfies the typical security need. © 2013 IEEE.","Chaff generation; Chaff points; Fingerprint; Fuzzy vault; Template protection","Biometrics; Polynomials; Real time control; Security of data; Signal processing; Chaff generation; Chaff points; Fingerprint; Fuzzy vault; Template protection; Algorithms"

The exponential relationship between illumination intensity and palm thickness was figured out according to the optical model of the human palm and dynamic range of the CCD. Firstly, three different intensities of NIR light with the same wave length of 850 nm were be used as illumination in the experiment to obtain the palm vein images respectively. Secondly, palm vein images were divided into several sub-images which are with high contrast. Next, the adaptive equalization was employed to enhance palm vein images. Finally, the method of weighting gradient splicing was applied to obtain the integrated palm vein images. Experimental result shows that the fusion method can improve the contrast of each part of palm vein images effectively compared with the transmission method with single illumination intensity and the reflection method. This method can be used in several application fields, such as venipuncture, biometrics and is of great value in the areas of identification recognition and the information security in the future.","Image fusion; Infrared radiation; Multi-illumination; Optical instruments; Palm model; Transmissions","Biometrics; Image fusion; Infrared radiation; Optical instruments; Security of data; Transmissions; Adaptive equalization; Application fields; Illumination intensity; Multi-illumination; Near infrared region; Optical modeling; Reflection methods; Transmission methods; Infrared devices"

Cyber defense in these advanced democracies are limited, unstructured, and focused on anecdotal cyber interchanges of marginal geopolitical value. The factual reach of government activities once a conflict is initiated is likely to be miniscule. Therefore the information security activities, and assessments leading to cyber defense efforts, have to be strategically pre-event coordinated within the state. This coordination should be following a framework that ensures institutional stability, public trust, and limit challenges to the state. The paper presents a case to use societal cyber war theory to create a public sector cyber defense strategy beforehand facing a massive state actor initiated automated systematic cyber attacks to limit the risk for a societal system shock. Societal cyber war theory utilizes a theoretical framework created by political scientist Dwight Waldo for government stability, turns it upside down, and uses the theory to identify cyber targets and aim points. As a theory it can be used in cyber defense and offense as the institutional weaknesses can be either attacked or defended. According to societal cyber war theory the aim points to be targeted by an automated premeditated systematic attack that will cripple the targeted nation is the five pillars that upholds the state - legitimacy, authority, knowledge, control, and confidence. The failure to protect the institutional stability could undermine the state's ability to avoid submission to foreign power. © 2013 IEEE.","cyber operations; cyberdefense; cyberwar; defense; information assurance; information operations; offensive cyber operations; societal cyberwar theory","Computer crime; Crime; Information science; Societies and institutions; Cyber operations; Cyber-defense; Cyberwar; defense; Information assurance; Information operations; Network security"

Because security risk is influenced by attackers and defenders, it is necessary to consider the costs and benefits of both sides. However, the current evaluation methods mostly focus on one side. To solve the problem, in this paper we propose a security risk evaluation model Based on complete information static game (SRE-CSG). The SRE-CSG model represents the interaction and mutual influence of both sides' strategies in the confrontation. On the basis of the SRE-CSG model, we present an improved payoff calculation method. The method takes into account the cost parameters and benefit parameters, and therefore be able to more accurately calculate the payoff. By analyzing Nash equilibrium strategy of information security game, an algorithm is designed to evaluate security risk value. The risk value derived from the algorithm is Based on equilibrium strategy of attackers and defenders, so it is more comprehensive and accurate. The SRE-CSG model and the algorithm can provide theoretical support for the efficient information systems security protection. The example analysis proves the effectiveness of the model and algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.","Game theory; Nash equilibrium; Risk evaluation; Security risk domain","Algorithms; Cybernetics; Game theory; Information systems; Security of data; Complete information; Equilibrium strategy; Information systems security; Nash equilibria; Nash equilibrium strategies; Risk evaluation; Security risk evaluations; Security risks; Mathematical models"

The purpose of this article is to review the steps that can be taken to ensure secure transfer of information over public and home networks, given the increasing utilization of mobile devices in radiology. CONCLUSION. With the rapid technologic developments in radiology, knowledge of various technical aspects is crucial for any practicing radiologist. Utilization of mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets, and even cellular phones, for reading radiologic studies has become increasingly prevalent. With such usage comes a need to ensure that both the user's and the patient's private information is protected. There are several steps that can be taken to protect sensitive information while using public networks. These steps include being diligent in reviewing the networks to which one connects, ensuring encrypted connections to websites, using strong passwords, and using a virtual private network and a firewall. As the role of information technology in modern radiology practice becomes more critical, these safety mechanisms must be addressed when viewing studies on any mobile device.","Cybersecurity; Teleradiology","Cellular Phone; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Security; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; Humans; Internet; Microcomputers; Radiology; Radiology Information Systems; United States; Wireless Technology; access to information; application service provider; computer network; computer program; computer security; crime; cybercrime; food and drug administration; information system; Internet; medical ethics; mobile phone; patient information; priority journal; radiologist; radiology; review; web browser; wireless communication"

Although intrusion detection systems (IDS) make big progress on defending against computing malice, there is still a gap between current IDSs and ideal malice defense systems. On the other hand, anticipatory reasoning-reacting systems (ARRS) were proposed as a high secure system with the ability to defend against malice anticipatorily, however, until now, there is no concrete implementation of ARRS for security, as well as no evidence showing the practical usefulness of anticipatory computing for security. As a step towards to ideal secure systems, we designed and implemented an ARRS for malice defense, which can adapt to different application by configuring different information source, anticipatory model, and anticipatory actions. We also evaluated our system by KDD99 dataset and a case study of web server. This paper proposes what features ideal malice defense systems should have, points out the gap between current IDSs and ideal malice defense systems, shows why some advantages of ARRSs could contribute ideal malice defense systems, and presents and evaluates a practical implementation of ARRS for security. © 2013 IEEE.","anticipatory computing; anticipatory reasoning-reacting system; intrusion detection system; malice defense system","Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Anticipatory actions; Anticipatory computing; Anticipatory model; anticipatory reasoning-reacting system; Defense system; Information sources; Intrusion Detection Systems; Secure system; Software engineering"

Besides, human aspects are not often given much importance in these methods. These issues create a considerable drawback as the available opportunities to an entity (organization, system, etc.) might go unnoticed which might hamper the entity from achieving its objectives. Moreover, understanding the motives of humans play an important role in guiding the risk analysis. This paper reviews several existing RAMMs to highlight the above issues and provides reasoning as to emphasize the importance of these two issues in information security management. From the analysis of the selected methods, we identified that a majority of the methods acknowledge only threat and the consideration of human factors have not been reflected. Although, the issues are not new, these still remain open and the field of risk management needs to be directed towards addressing them. The review is expected to be helpful both to the researchers and practitioners in providing relevant information to consider these issues for further improving the existing RAMMs or when developing new methods. © 2013 IEEE.","human factors; opportunity; risk management","Information science; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security of data; Human aspects; Information security managements; Information security risk managements; opportunity; Paradigm shifts; Risk analysis and management; Human engineering"

With respect to IAS, these universities are therefore required to self-regulate through measuring against international norms and standards. One such norm for the IT profession is given by the ACM/IEEE-CS in the 'Information Technology 2008, Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Information Technology' document. This paper examines this norm, together with relevant South African curricula policy document, to establish what information security guidance exists to support IT curriculum developers and educators.

However, security problems are still imminent - as highlighted by the plethora of media articles and research efforts. The insider risk is stated as being around 80% of security threats [1] in a company. With this statistic in mind, management has to plan how to allocate resources to counteract the risks. Very often, simple measures such as good password behaviour are overlooked or not rated high enough to include in all security awareness programmes.

These conferences have been held every second year since then, with the eighth one being held in 2013. Not surprisingly, there has been numerous high quality papers presented and published in the WISE conference proceedings over the years. However, many of these publications are not easily accessible and are therefore not being readily cited. One of the reasons for the inaccessibility of these papers is that they have not been made widely available through either print or a well-known repository on the Web. Furthermore, a need exists to reflect on what has been done in the past in order to realize the future of these conferences and related events. In order to begin the process of addressing this need, this paper presents a review of the IFIP WG 11.8 publications through the ages. It also reflects briefly on the problems relating to the inaccessibility of these publications, the decline in paper submissions and the lack of citations. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.","Content analysis; Information security education; Publication classification; Wise conference publications","Education; Security of data; Conference publications; Content analysis; High quality papers; Information security education; Publishing"

Meanwhile, the usage of context-aware technique ensured adaptability to the user's personalized privacy settings, and enabled the LBS provider's server to retrieve the minimal incremental nearest-neighbor query results. Theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the technique's effectiveness on LBS accuracy, privacy protection and communication QoS (quality-of-service) compared with SpaceTwist.","Adaptive context-aware; Context-awareness; Information security; Located-based service; Location privacy; Privacy preservation","Communication; Location based services; Quality of service; Security of data; Context-Aware; Context-awareness; Located-based service; Location privacy; Privacy preservation; Data privacy"

In order to integrate agricultural information resources and realize the share and exchange of agricultural information resources, the construction of an agricultural information service system is an effective way. In the paper, combined with the current situation of agricultural informationization construction in China, how to construct the agricultural microorganism information service system is discussed to realize the share and exchange of agricultural information. In order to express various agricultural information, an Agricultural Information Markup Language (AIML) is design that is an XML-based special language for describing agricultural information resources. The system improves the scope and extent of information share and operation coordination by providing common supporting service for operation systems, such as, information exchange service, information security service, etc. Consequently, the whole efficiency of agricultural informationization is enhanced.","Agricultural information; Information service; Microorganism; Sharing and exchange; XML","Hypertext systems; Information dissemination; Information services; Microorganisms; Security of data; XML; Agricultural information service systems; Agricultural informations; Current situation; Information exchanges; Information resource; Information service systems; Information share; Informationization; agricultural information; Agricultural Information Markup Language; agriculture; article; China; information; information service; information technology; Internet; markup language; microorganism; nonhuman; web browser; XML; Agriculture"

In this regard, adequate security of information and systems that process it is critical to the operation of all organizations. Therefore organizations must understand and improve the current status of their information security in order to ensure business continuity and increase rate of return on investments. Since, information security has a very important role in supporting the activities of the organization and for this reason; it is needed to have a standard or benchmark which controls governance over information security. Hence, this paper discusses some of Information Security Management System (ISMS) standards in order to determine their strengths and challenges. Then, based on most appropriate standards in the field, a method is proposed to allow information technology-related or based enterprises to implement their ISMS. This method helps identifying critical assets and related threats and vulnerabilities, assessing assets risks and providing necessary risk treatment plans. The proposed method makes it possible and structured to establish information security management system in IT related large-scale enterprises.","Information security; ISMS; ISO/IEC 27000 series; Risk assessment",""
