Being expected to continue its growth, especially in the mission-critical workloads. Parallel to the Linux adoption has increased its misuse by attackers and malicious users. This has increased attention paid to kernel security through the deployment of kernel protection mechanisms. Kernel-based attacks require reliability, where kernel attack reliability is achieved through the information gathering stage, where the attacker is able to gather enough information about the target to succeed. The taxonomy of kernel vulnerabilities includes information leaks (CWE-200), that are a class of vulnerabilities that permit access to the kernel memory layout and contents. Information leaks can improve the attack reliability enabling the attacker to read sensitive kernel data to bypass kernel based protections. In this work, we aim at the analysis and detection of stack-based information leaks to harden the security of the kernel. First, we analyse the problem of kernel infoleaks in Section 3, next, we examine the impact of infoleaks attacks on the security of the kernel in Section 4. Then, we present a technique for detecting kernel based infoleaks through static analysis Section 5. Next, we evaluate our technique by applying it to the Linux kernel in Section 6. Finally, we discuss the applications and limitations of our work (Section 6.3) and finally we draw our concluding remarks. © The Author 2016.","Confidentiality; Information disclosure (Infoleak); Information security; Kernel; Operating system","Linux; Reliability; Static analysis; Computing solutions; Confidentiality; Fundamental component; Information disclosure; Information disclosure (infoleak); Kernel; Linux kernel; Mission critical; Operating system; Protection mechanisms; Security of data"

Nonetheless, the purge of malicious packets is still too often relegated to the destination of the attacks letting the unwanted traffic roam freely. At the same time, the next generation of routers promises to be able to modulate energy consumption on the basis of actual traffic, thus the presence of malicious traffic in the network is a cause of economic losses in itself, even when the attack is not successful. In past work, we modelled and analysed the energy savings enabled by aggressive intrusion detection; however, fluctuations in the traffic intensity has not been fully taken into account. In this article, we introduce a new enhanced adaptive model that takes into full account the actual load of routers including what is due to forecasting errors. © The Author 2016.","Energy-aware security; Intrusion detection systems; IPS-enabled routers","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Energy conservation; Intrusion detection; Losses; Network security; Power management (telecommunication); % reductions; Cyber security; Energy aware; Energy-aware security; Information-based economy; Intrusion Detection Systems; IPS-enabled router; Network attack; Network energy consumption; Security breaches; Energy utilization"

The threats of mobile intelligent terminal are gradually revealed. There are a few previous studies on the risk assessment of intelligent terminal. From now on they did not establish an assessment system. Previous studies on the security evaluation of intelligent terminals mostly gave the result of system security, insecurity and general security, they did not give the most probable attack way. If the managers know the most probable attack way, they will find the weakest places so that they can protect this system. This paper proposes an intelligent terminal security risk assessment scheme based on attack tree. It can not only evaluate the security of the system, but also can find the most probable attack path. We build an intelligent terminal model based on attack tree, then use probabilistic risk assessment technique to calculate the occurrence probability of leaf nodes, root node and attack sequences. The risk value of root node can be calculated according to the threat value caused by the realization of attack target. The calculation result shows the root node's probability of being attacked, then can help the risk management persons to find the weakest places and the most dangerous attack scenario in the intelligent terminal. The calculation result also effectively indicates the assessment of security about intelligent terminal. © 2016 IEEE.","Attack tree; Information security; Intelligent terminal; Risk Assessment","Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Forestry; Risk management; Risk perception; Risks; Security of data; Assessment system; Attack tree; Calculation results; Intelligent terminal; Mobile intelligent terminals; Occurrence probability; Probabilistic risk assessment techniques; Security evaluation; Risk assessment"

The framework yields concrete recommendations, which complex system and critical infrastructure stakeholders can utilize to improve security within their networks. The analysis framework aims to offer key stakeholders a better understanding of the legal and economic requirements for cybersecurity and provide them with recommendations that are in line with modern cybersecurity strategies, including the enhancement of cooperation and collaboration capabilities and the implementation of other state-of-the-art security mechanisms. © 2016 IEEE.","Complex systems; Critical infrastructures; Cybersecurity; Economics of cybersecurity; Legal analysis; Situational awareness","Complex networks; Economic analysis; Large scale systems; Public works; Security of data; Analysis frameworks; Collaboration capabilities; Complex environments; Cyber security; Economic requirements; Legal analysis; Security mechanism; Situational awareness; Critical infrastructures"

They gather events from multiple sensors (intrusion detection systems, anti-virus, firewalls, etc.), correlate these events, and deliver synthetic views of the alerts for threat handling and security reporting. However, as the number of security incidents, and thus the diversity of alerts received by SIEMs increases, the need for appropriate treatment of these alerts has become essential. Alert correlation has been proposed in order to alleviate this problem. Current alert correlation techniques provide a better description of the detected incident and a concise view of the generated alerts, reducing their volume and thus their processing time. Although such techniques support administrators in processing a huge number of alerts, they remain limited, since these solutions do not provide information about the attacker's behavior and the defender's capability in reacting to detected attacks. In this paper, we propose two novel alert correlation approaches. The first is based on policy enforcement and defender capability models; and the second is based on information security indicators. We therefore enrich the current state of the art in alert correlation techniques with complementary approaches. © 2016 IEEE.","","Computer system firewalls; Correlation methods; Information management; Intrusion detection; Security of data; Viruses; Alert correlation; Capability model; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multiple sensors; Policy enforcement; Security incident; Security information and event management systems; Security operations; Computer viruses"

Most critical infrastructures were primarily designed to work isolated from the normal communication network, but due to the advent of the ""Smart Grid"" that uses advanced and intelligent approaches to control critical infrastructure, it is necessary for these cyber-physical systems to have access to the communication system. Consequently, such critical systems have become prime targets; hence security of critical infrastructure is currently one of the most challenging research problems. Performing an extensive security analysis involving experiments with cyber-attacks on a live industrial control system (ICS) is not possible. Therefore, researchers generally resort to test beds and complex simulations to answer questions related to SCADA systems.

It sketches the diverse technical ways in which an attack may occur, including denial-of-service attacks and the insertion of various forms ofmalware. It argues that existing international law and widely discussed principles of Just War Theory do not straightforwardly apply to cyberwarfare, and many forms of cyberwarfare differ from previous forms of warfare in neither injuring nor killing human beings, nor causing lasting physical damage - but can nevertheless cause serious harm to a nations vital interests. Another dissimilarity with traditional warfare is in the degree of knowledge of the identity of an attacker (the 'attribution problem'). The paper argues that cyberwarfare is not amenable to regulation by international pacts and that we can expect long periods of low-level, multilateral cyberwarfare, a Cyber Cold War, as a game-theoretic equilibrium is sought, .

Once the systems are connected to the network, security is a major challenge. Connected systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. To counteract the cybersecurity threats, a system of layered security measures must be applied from the system power-up. A hardware root-of-trust is a secure foundation for implementing secure systems. It must provide the reliability essential for DO-254 compliant systems, and industry standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols. This is possible through the use of flash-based secure FPGAs which provide advanced security capabilities, SRAM-PUF based key management, and anti-tamper countermeasures. The advanced security and reliability capabilities of the flash-based secure FPGAs meet the requirements for hardware root-of-trust in avionics applications. The e-Enabled aircraft must have the security measures to authenticate software from power-up, securely communicate with ground stations, and perform secure remote software updates.

In every technology, data becomes the most important asset to be protected. Many encryption algorithms are widely available and used in information security. Encryption can provide secure information across platform. Encryption algorithms are classified into two groups: symmetric-key (also called secret-key) and asymmetric-key (also called public-key). Generally, asymmetric-key encryption is used along side symmetric-key encryption to get the best performance of data transfer. Earlier many researchers have proposed various encryption algorithms such as AES, DES, Blowfish, etc. However, as security level is increasing, the time and complexity of algorithm is also increasing. This is the major cause of decreasing the speed and efficiency of the encryption system. In this paper we have proposed a new encryption algorithm 'Double Chaining Algorithm (DCA)' which enhances the security performance. The DCA is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that uses 128-256 bits key size. This algorithm uses XOR operation for the chaining process so that it has small complexity and can be implemented easily in hardware mode to increase its encryption process. This paper is an attempt to invent a new encryption model which is secure and very fast. The average Avalanche Effect in this algorithm is 0.996 out of 1.00. Moreover, the experiment and analysis result gives further proof of the DCA's strength. © 2016 IEEE.","Avalanche Effect; information security Double Chaining Algorithm; symmetric-key encryption","Computational complexity; Data transfer; Security of data; Avalanche effects; Complexity of algorithm; Encryption algorithms; Encryption system; Experiment and analysis; Security performance; Symmetric key encryption; Symmetric key encryption algorithm; Cryptography"

In the present paper, we argue that a suboptimal cybersecurity environment is partly due to organizations' underinvestment on security and a lack of suitable policies. The motivation for this paper stems from a related policy question: how to design policies for governments and other organizations that can ensure a sufficient level of cybersecurity. We address the question by exploring a policy devised to alleviate information asymmetry and to achieve transparency in cybersecurity information sharing practice. We propose a cybersecurity evaluation agency along with regulations on information disclosure. To empirically evaluate the effectiveness of such an institution, we conduct a large-scale randomized field experiment on 7919US organizations. Specifically, we generate organizations' security reports based on their outbound spam relative to the industry peers, then share the reports with the subjects in either private or public ways.

This increase in Internet consumption has resulted in the creation of various services including web services, SNS (Social Networking Services), Internet banking, and remote processing systems, enhancing the quality of life globally. However, serious information security problems have surfaced alongside these services, leading to Internet privacy invasions and network attacks. This paper presents a process to detect anomalous traffic using selfsimilarity analysis in the ATMSim environment as a research method to resolve these problems. In order to measure anomalous traffic, normal traffic for each attack including ARP spoofing and DDoS was measured for 48 hours. Hadoop is employed to process the massive traffic data collected and MapReduce was used after storing the data in HDFS. The detection system ATMSim, which is a new platform operating on Hadoop, is used to identify anomalous traffic, and a comparative analysis of the normal and anomalous traffic was performed through a self-similarity analysis. The collected traffic was divided into four categories according to the attack method: normal LAN traffic, DDoS attack, ARP spoofing, and DDoS and ARP spoofing attacks. The anomalous traffic detection system ATMSim was used to simulate for each scenario and distinguish normal and anomalous traffic in order to determine whether real attacks can be effectively identified. Graphic and quantitative analyses based on the self-similarity estimation for the four different traffic types showed that, unlike normal traffic such as the LAN traffic, the graphic analysis revealed a burstiness phenomenon when anomalous traffic occurred and the self-similarity estimation values were also high. © 2016 IEEE.","Anomalous traffic detection; ATMSim; Hurst parameter; Self-similar estimation method; Stochastic selfsimilar process","Denial-of-service attack; Network security; Security of data; Stochastic systems; Ubiquitous computing; Web services; ATMSim; Estimation methods; Hurst parameter; Self-similar process; Traffic detection; Internet protocols"

To investigate whether professionals make such decisions optimally, we conduct an online experiment and survey measuring risk attitudes of security professionals. Participants were asked to state their willingness-to-pay to avoid a series of losses-only lotteries and to make choices between such lotteries. We examine their behaviour in these lotteries and conclude that security professionals do not minimize expected losses. Our findings suggest that security professionals are risk and ambiguity averse and are susceptible to framing effects. We contrast their behaviour to that of a random sample of students. We find that the preferences of security professionals are measurably different from those students in several respects. Finally, we devise a mechanism to elicit professionals' preferences between security and operability. We find that the nature of professionals' employment influences their security versus operability preferences.

A cloud service consists of a set of interacting applications/processes running on one or more interconnected VMs. Organizations are increasingly embracing cloud services as a means of outsourcing their IT departments. However, cloud service availability is not guaranteed, especially in the event of anomalous circumstances that spontaneously disrupt availability (e.g., natural disasters, power failure, cybersecurity attacks, etc.). In this paper, we propose a framework for developing intelligent systems that can monitor and migrate cloud services to maximize their availability in case of cloud disruption. The framework includes a virtual machine selection algorithm that maximizes the availability of high priority services during migration under time and network bandwidth constraints. The framework also facilitates the incorporation of algorithms for automatically detecting anomalies to trigger live migration of cloud services. We implemented the framework and conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the underlying techniques. Based on the experiments, the use of this framework results in less downtime due to migration, thereby leading to reduced cloud service disruption. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Cloud Service Availability; Intelligent Systems; Live Migration of Virtual Machines; Self-Managing Cloud Services","Availability; Cloud computing; Disasters; Distributed database systems; Intelligent systems; Java programming language; Large scale systems; Network security; Web services; Cloud service providers; Cloud services; Live migrations; Natural disasters; Network bandwidth; On-demand services; Priority service; Virtual machines; Distributed computer systems"

These threats may occur because of different changes happening internally or externally of the organization.

Thus, far, the sole demonstration of true random numbers has been generated through thermal noise and/or quantum effects, which suffers from expensive and complex equipment. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for self-powered creation of true random numbers by using triboelectric technology to collect random signals from nature. This random number generator based on coupled triboelectric and electrostatic induction effects at the liquid-dielectric interface includes an elaborately designed triboelectric generator (TENG) with an irregular grating structure, an electronic-optical device, and an optical-electronic device. The random characteristics of raindrops are harvested through TENG and consequently transformed and converted by electronic-optical device and an optical-electronic device with a nonlinear characteristic. The cooperation of the mechanical, electrical, and optical signals ensures that the generator possesses complex nonlinear input-output behavior and contributes to increased randomness. The random number sequences are deduced from final electrical signals received by an optical-electronic device using a familiar algorithm. These obtained random number sequences exhibit good statistical characteristics, unpredictability, and unrepeatability. Our study supplies a simple, practical, and effective method to generate true random numbers, which can be widely used in cryptographic protocols, digital signatures, authentication, identification, and other information security fields. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","random number generator; self-powered; triboelectric nanogenerator; true random numbers","Authentication; Cryptography; Dielectric materials; Dielectric properties of liquids; Electron devices; Electronic equipment; Electrostatic generators; Electrostatics; Network security; Nonlinear optics; Number theory; Optical devices; Quantum electronics; Quantum theory; Security of data; Thermoelectric equipment; Triboelectricity; Electrostatic induction; Nanogenerator; Nonlinear characteristics; Random number generators; Self-powered; Statistical characteristics; Tribo-electric generator; True randoms; Random number generation"

Numerous strategies are coming up to shield the information from going under the control of unapproved individual. Steganography and cryptography are two unique strategies for information security. The primary reason in cryptography is to make message idea unintelligible. While steganography expects to hide secret messages. Digital pictures are amazing transporters of hidden information. I propose a technique for joining steganography and cryptography for mystery information correspondence. In this paper, we propose an elite JPEG steganography alongside a substitution encryption procedure.

Therefore, the evaluation platform takes on the above mentioned algorithms from two very divergent perspectives: one of them focuses mainly on CPU vs. GPU performance issues, whereas the latter tackles the problem of randomness of the encrypted results by comparison to several strict criteria. In order to achieve these goals, the platform provides a graphical user interface which eases interactions such as: Tests selection, worker attachment or removal, events logging, input provision and output analysis.

As part of that order, he directed the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop a framework that would become an authoritative source for information security best practices. Because adoption of the framework is voluntary, it faces the challenge of incentivizing firms to follow along. Will frameworks such as that proposed by NIST really induce firms to adopt better security controls? And if not, why? This research seeks to examine the composition and costs of cyber events, and attempts to address whether or not there exist incentives for firms to improve their security practices and reduce the risk of attack. Specifically, we examine a sample of over 12 000 cyber events that include data breaches, security incidents, privacy violations, and phishing crimes. First, we analyze the characteristics of these breaches (such as causes and types of information compromised).We then examine the breach and litigation rate, by industry, and identify the industries that incur the greatest costs from cyber events. We then compare these costs to bad debts and fraud within other industries. The findings suggest that public concerns regarding the increasing rates of breaches and legal actions may be excessive compared to the relatively modest financial impact to firms that suffer these events. Public concerns regarding the increasing rates of breaches and legal actions, conflict, however, with our findings that show a much smaller financial impact to firms that suffer these events. Specifically, we find that the cost of a typical cyber incident in our sample is less than $200 000 (about the same as the firm's annual IT security budget), and that this represents only 0.4% of their estimated annual revenues. © The Author 2016.","Cyber insurance; Data breach; Data breach litigation; Privacy violation; Security incident","Budget control; Crime; Security of data; Security systems; Financial impacts; National institute for standards and technologies; Privacy violation; Public concern; Security Best Practices; Security controls; Security incident; Security Practice; Costs"

In this paper, a privacy-preserving distributed optimal scheduling method is proposed for the interconnected microgrids (IMG) with a battery energy storage system (BESS) and renewable energy resources (RESs). The optimal scheduling problem is modeled to minimize the coalitional operation cost of the IMG, including the fuel cost of conventional distributed generators and the life loss cost of BESSs. By using the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a distributed optimal scheduling model and an iteration solution algorithm for the IMG is introduced; only the expected exchanging power (EEP) of each MG is required during the iterations. Furthermore, a privacy-preserving strategy for the sharing of the EEP among MGs is designed to work with the mechanism of the distributed algorithm.

We highlight a unique partnership between the cybersecurity training and research communities with the common goal of capturing human team performance. Whether in the context of a training assessment or a research endeavor; both are two sides of the same coin. As cybersecurity training events and competitions have evolved, there is increasing interest in analyzing the performance of the defenders as well as identifying the best methods of training, assessing, and educating the cybersecurity workforce. This includes analysis of the types of training, pedagogy, and the relationship between education, training, and commercial Information Technology (IT) certifications. In this work, we present a high-level look along with some initial findings from the premiere cyber training event for the Army National Guard Bureau focused on enhancing the capabilities of cyber defense teams to mitigate threats to critical national infrastructure. Our first year data collection effort was conducted in the spring of 2015 and involved multiple threads of data collection. The main realization to come from this study is that improved systems and procedures should be put in place to effectively monitor and quantify team behavior for valid analyses. As the research and training partnership matures, we hope to significantly improve the data collection and assessment of human team performance in follow-on exercises. © 2016 IEEE.","assessment; cyber defense; cybersecurity; education; exercises; Measurement; performance; security; training; training","Data acquisition; Education; Measurements; Military communications; Personnel training; assessment; Cyber defense; Cyber security; exercises; performance; security; Network security"

Under this circumstance, participation of prosumers will result in a new business mode and electricity will be traded between these prosumers directly. These transactions can be managedeither by an established central operator or by market participants autonomously. Establishing a central operator will lead to a lot of problems, including high cost, low information security and personal privacy leakage. However, trust problem is hard to solve in autonomous management of transactions between market participants. Blockchain is a distributed storage technology where data is stored and managed in every node in the network and is difficult to tamper. Therefore, it can deal with trust problem. This paper proposes a method of managing electricity transactions based on blockchain. Transactions are stored on blockchain in form of smart contracts and money is transferred automatically. Electric data collected by smart meters is also stored on blockchain. An independent central operator only deals with congestion management problem. The paper also improves convergence stability in distributed security checking method.

Public key will be issued by CA (Certificate Authority). But having CA in wireless network makes it vulnerable to various attacks. Hence distributed cache was proposed where each node in network caches public key of some nodes existing in network in its cache and request to obtain keys not cached will be made via trusted nodes. Due to limited memory only few keys can be cached. There exists an optimal threshold value for caching keys so that equal number of both local nodes and remote nodes public keys can be cached. Methods: Random replacement policy was used for updating cache contents, where if a node's local/ remote key cached ratio exceeds optimal ratio then a key will be randomly chosen from the cache and will be removed. Here we propose implementation of bloom filter in cache to cache public key of nodes existing in network. Findings: By using bloom filter of large size, more number of public keys can be cached thereby providing space and time advantage and reduces query cost with increased usage of memory. MAC (Media Access Control) id and PSN (Processor Serial Number) are used for uniquely identifying each node in network and are stored in encrypted format. When mismatch is found in encrypted MAC id and PSN, then that node is determined to be malicious node and its id will be notified to all nodes in network thus excluding the node from making any communication to other nodes in the network. Applications: Used for checking an element's presence in the set thus reducing I/O lookup when large data set is used. Used as an alternative to cache as it uses limited memory more efficiently than cache does.","Bloom filter; Certificate authority; Distributed cache; PSN (processor serial number); Public key cryptography",""

In this investigation, we will present a technic to extract features throughout different abstraction levels in order to classify malware codes. This analysis is based on three factors: the position where the malware is detected, the functions' calls from each Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) and the ten most frequently visited hexadecimals per each malware sample. Once those characteristics are obtained, a descriptive vector of each malware is built. This vector works as a training to different learning machines types (SVM, IBL, and Decision Tree) and as a classification of the variations of malware codes (Virus, Backdoor, Trojan, and Adware). The result in the precision of the classification was 78.38% average where 3 types of learning machines were combined.

This article proposes a new iterative cryptographic algorithm of 3D stochastic data transformation, which is basically aimed for information security solutions. The algorithm is characterized by the high degree of parallelism at the level of elementary operations. It is proposed to design an iterative transformation based on the consistent and parallel composition of the round operations. Such an approach to the design of the iterative cipher blocks has not previously been used. Its use in a software implementation of the cryptographic transformation became possible due to the advent of the heterogeneous supercomputer technologies. It became possible to perform within a round in parallel (without performance compromising) complex transformations of different trajectories and then at the output perform the parallel composition of the results. As a result, the task of the encryption function inverting becomes computationally unsolvable with fewer rounds of transformation. © 2005 - 2016 JATIT & LLS.

Traditionally, social engineering attacks have always been a major cause of concern for Information Security departments. However, the theft, abuse and manipulation of personal information for malicious purposes has become even prolific since the mass adoption of social media and gaming applications by the average person, largely fueled by the boom in social media and gaming applications. These newly introduced and ever-evolving apps continue to introduce new vulnerabilities due to poor system design and coding practices and have led to a multitude of sophisticated attacks and digital crimes. Attacks such as, Malware infections, ransomware, Session Hijacking, SQL Injection, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks have been facilitated in part by the race to developing social media platforms, and applications. Hence, more effective countermeasures and prevention techniques are introduced to detect and minimize the resulting damage and losses associated with this trend. This paper presents a novel 'credentials crawling' proof of concept exploit to illustrate the ease with which such attacks can be launched. The proof of concept is implemented via a stealthy application, which has been implemented (in part) using a commercial of-the-shelf application (Camera Mouse 2011). The newly developed stealth robot uses stealth techniques to conceal itself from the intended target/victim. The proposed approach enables the developed robot application to remain undetected by leading commercial anti-virus solutions. The developed robot has been tested in different environments, with various operating systems protected by various commercial antivirus solutions. The presented approach was tested on computers belonging to people from different walks of life including graduate and undergraduate students, faculty and staff (with their consent). The initial test result demonstrates that the proposed technique is effective as a tool to assist with promoting awareness against a variety of user-focused cyber-attacks especially phishing attacks. © 2016 IEEE.","Awaerness; Cybercrime; Malware; Tool; Trojan; USB","Crime; Information dissemination; Malware; Network security; Personal computing; Robots; Security of data; Social networking (online); Students; Tools; Awaerness; Commercial of the shelves; Cybercrime; Man in the middle attacks; Prevention techniques; Social media platforms; Trojans; Undergraduate students; Computer crime"

This paper introduces the problem of selective forwarding in MWSNs, and discusses how available techniques for mitigation this problem in WSNs are not applicable in handling the problem in MWSNs due to sensors mobility. Therefore, the paper proposes a model that provides a global monitoring capability for tracing moving sensors and detecting malicious ones.

Investing in something that is intangible is often not seen as priority expenditure as it brings no Return on Investment nor contributes to expanding the business. However, the newly enacted Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act forces businesses to re-evaluate their stance on information security and data storage protection as POPI requires that 'appropriate and reasonable security measures' be put in place to effectively protect all personal information that large organisations as well as smaller businesses process and more importantly store. However, the lack of comprehensive controls found within any one information security approach (information security standard, best practice or framework) to fully address the requirements of the POPI act, leaves businesses exposed to legislative action under POPI. This paper, through the use of a detailed literature review and qualitative content analysis aims to analyze widely implemented information security approaches in the context of POPI compliance. Through identifying themes for data protection within various information security approaches, an evaluation of the comprehensiveness of these approaches and their proposed mechanisms for protecting data within businesses is conducted. © 2016 IEEE.","Business; Data; Data Security; Information Security; Legislation; POPI; Storage Protection","Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Industry; Laws and legislation; Comprehensive controls; Data; Legislative action; Literature reviews; Personal information; POPI; Security measure; Storage protection; Security of data"

A virtual laboratory is implemented for the provision of training environments for practical exercises. Tele-Lab uses virtual machine (VM) technology and virtual network devices. A VM is used to represent a physical computer in an exercise scenario. While every VM needs a specific resource allocation, availability and scalability of Tele-lab become an issue. Scaling out Tele-Lab to a public cloud is one alternative to making it more available and scalable. Public clouds are very flexible in providing resources since customers can add or reduce resources whenever needed. A second alternative is the reduction of resources needed for a single training environment, e.g. by replacing the virtualization technology in Tele-Lab with the one that uses fewer resources than full-fledged virtual machines. A container uses far fewer resources than a virtual machine. The paper at hand elaborates on the use of containers (i.e. Docker) in the training environment of a man in the middle (MITM) attack and Firewall learning units, designed to replace VMs. This work is part of the continuous improvement on Tele-Lab to make it more reliable and more scalable. © 2016 International Journal of Learning and Teaching.

CAPTCHA is a method that distinguishes human beings from artificial intelligence in order to prohibit malicious programs from acquiring accounts on Internet. The most popular CAPTCHA is text-based CAPTCHA with distorted alphabets and numbers. However, it is known that all of text-based CAPTCHA algorithms can be analyzed by computers. In addition, too much distortion or noise prevents human beings from recognizing alphabets or numbers. As a solution of the problems, an effective text-based CAPTCHA algorithm with amodal completion was proposed by our team. Our CAPTCHA causes computers a large amount of calculation costs while amodal completion helps human beings to recognize characters momentarily. Our CAPTCHA has evolved with aftereffects and combinations of complementary colors. In this paper, we evaluate our CAPTCHA by machine learning since machine learning is faster and more accurate than existing calculations by a computer. We confirm the limitations of machine learning.

To solve this problem, this paper found that the statistical information of Android components (mainly activity) from the Manifest file cannot be ignored, based on the traditional method of Android permission detection. In this paper, a new feature vector is extracted from the AndroidManifest file, which combines the permission information and the component information of the Android application.

Like any asset, there are threats to the information that impact processes such as; email retrieval and access to organizational system services. As a consequence of the threats, attention to the security of the information is important. Technology is utilized to secure information and the cost affiliated to the technology can be dire. As technology evolves with each transitory decade, there are different phenomenon's that attempt to process and secure organizational information whilst reducing costs. The evolution of technology has developed a new phenomenon called 'Bring Your Own Device' (BYOD). BYOD is a phenomenon that allows employees to use their own personal mobile device to complete organizational tasks. The adoption of BYOD expands from large organizations to small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs). With the adoption of BYOD there are benefits and more significantly risks associated to BYOD. Therefore, this paper will discuss the SMME context and its challenges towards the governance of BYOD. In addition, there will be a discussion on how organizations can govern BYOD in an SMME context by considering the existing BYOD approaches and provide an approach suitable for SMMEs. Furthermore, the suitable BYOD approach for an SMME context will further be evaluated and compared against the existing BYOD approaches that were identified.

To address this issue, this paper reports on an online InfoSec laboratory. Development of the laboratory follows an action design research approach. For this purpose, initial design principles were used that are derived from the existing pedagogical theories such as Conversational Framework, Constructive Alignment, and Personalized System of Instruction, literature reviews and empirical data.

Our approach has two phases. We first perform the static analysis to identify the possible attack critical path based on Android API and the existing attack patterns, next we perform the dynamic analysis which follows the path to execute the program in a limited and focused scope, and detect the attack possibility by checking conformance of detected path with the existing attack patterns.

Basedon the ideas of knowledge combination derived from CreativeComputing, in order to provide a safer user experience, thispaper attempts to introduce a creative encryption approachbased on Pataphysics. Pataphysics is widely known as the scienceof imaginary solutions and laws, governing exceptions. One of themost important advantages of Pataphysics is the novel orinnovative methods to understand and explore the surroundingworld. It is believed that based on the key concepts provided byPataphysics, Clinamen, something new might be discovered fortraditional encryption design.

This paper qualitatively analyses more than 200 graphical passwords for patterns other than the classically reported hotspots. The qualitative analysis finds that a significant percentage of passwords fall into a small set of patterns; patterns that can be used to form attack models against GPs. In counter action, these patterns can also be used to educate users so that future password selection is more secure.

The powerful security mechanism is required to handle the transactions between end users over mobile communication channel using mobile computing. This paper presents a three-tier (and two-tier) security mechanism that effectively controls the information security with the security key agreement and exchange protocol. This security system is suitable for the communication channel having low bandwidth. The mobile computing system relies on the heterogeneous network with their independent policies. The security system is powerful enough to provide the encryption while the object transit between networks. The architecture of mobile computing security is client-server approach to protect the data flows over the insecure communication channel. The mobile computing system facing the potential attacks and can be secure by the most powerful firewalls, while the information travelling over the insecure wireless network can be effectively secured by a variety of cryptographic algorithms such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as well as the steganographic algorithms such Least Significant Bit insertion algorithm. This proposed system is beneficial over the conventional security mechanism used independently such as the cryptographic algorithms or the steganographic algorithms in terms of speed, memory requirements, less requirements of resources. The proposed system is beneficial over the symmetric key cryptographic algorithm by incorporating the three-tier based trusted third party steganographic key agreement protocol. Even though, due to the less availability of network resources, low bandwidth and small memory, it can work faster because of the small algorithmic structure. The system proposed in this research is suitable for the mobile computing applications run over the mobile communication channels. This system is beneficial for the low bandwidth network while no security key is transmitted over the communication channel. Therefore, it can posses high security for various mobile computing applications. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

Stealthy malware can spread through a network undetected by utilizing zero-day exploits to propagate and hiding malicious behavior in normal activity, potentially doing significant damage before exploited vulnerabilities can be identified or patches developed. In this work, we consider a scenario in which an attacker deploys propagating malware enabling the exfiltration of data from infected devices, and a defender deploys detection and recovery mechanisms designed to control malware spread while obeying network-wide resource constraints. We use a stochastic model to represent changes in the state of the network and analytically derive an upper bound on the total rate at which an optimal attacker can exfiltrate data from the network, expressed in terms of several network parameters, when the detection rate is proportional to the outgoing data rate at each infected device. Our results can help inform cybersecurity decision-makers in judiciously allocating resources to manage risk. © 2016 IEEE.","Computational modeling; Computer security; Data models; Malware; Mathematical model; Stochastic processes","Computer crime; Data structures; Decision making; Mathematical models; Military communications; Network security; Random processes; Security of data; Security systems; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Computational model; Data exfiltration; Malicious behavior; Network parameters; Recovery mechanisms; Resource Constraint; Sensitive informations; Stealthy malware; Malware"

Recently, the famous genomic DNA has been introduced as a hiding medium, known as DNA steganography, due to its notable ability to hide huge data sets with a high level of randomness and hence security. Despite the numerous cryptography techniques, to our knowledge only the vigenere cipher and the DNA-based playfair cipher have been combined with the DNA steganography, which keeps space for investigation of other techniques and coming up with new improvements. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis between the DNA-based playfair, vigenere, RSA and the AES ciphers, each combined with a DNA hiding technique. The conducted analysis reports the performance diversity of each combined technique in terms of security, speed, hiding capacity in addition to both key size and data size. Moreover, this paper proposes a modification of the current combined DNA-based playfair cipher technique, which makes it not only simple and fast but also provides a significantly higher hiding capacity and security.

In a previous study, Morita and Nishiguchi [(2013). Classification model using contrast patterns. In the 15th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, Vol. 1, pp. 336-341] proposed a classification model using contrast patterns (CACP). CACP has been applied to practical data and successfully used to construct effective models [Morita, H, Y Shirai and Y Nakamoto (2013). Analysis method for flash marketing incorporating diversification on purchasing. In Annual Conference of Japan Society for Management Information 2013 Autumn, pp. 329-332 (in Japanese); Nishiguchi, M (2014). Classification model using contrast patterns and GRASP. Journal of Information Assurance & Security, 9(5), 235-243]. In their research, we can see that a large number of CPs are required to construct a high-performance model that can be applied to real business data. In terms of knowledge management, the model must provide highly accurate predictions, and offer high readability for their implementations. Such models provide a significant amount of knowledge. To find such knowledge, it is important to select a necessary subset of CPs and to construct a simple model, while maintaining the performance of the model. Further, we propose a visualisation method called Contrast Ranked Path Diagram (CRPD) that allows us to interpret the relationships among the CPs. In computational experiments, we initially apply our method to well-known benchmark problems. From the results, we show that our proposed model outperforms existing methods in terms of the necessary number of CPs and prediction accuracy. Subsequently, we apply our method to actual data from a Japanese retailer, and show the usefulness of the data for business applications. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Co.","Classification model; contrast patterns; visualisation method",""

The access of the internet is easier day by day. My personal experience shows the young generation use smartphones, tablets to keep in contact with friends at home, on public transport, in the school etc. except sleeping. They use different communication forms like community sides, chat rooms and so on. These applications are protected by password authentication system to keep save the data of the users. I was interested for which systems find the mechanical engineering students important in everyday life and what kind of password use for protecting the information. Why is it important? We see almost in every month in the news a service provider was attacked again by hackers and the have put the username and the passwords on the Internet. The success of the attack depends on user error mainly. The companies store sometimes the important data without any protection. On the other hand the users share sensitive information on the community sites ('I am going to a party today evening', 'I am on holiday by the see' it means my home is empty tonight if I leave alone). I find the information security is a very important question today when we use lot of systems and we store the important information on devices, in cloud and so on. We have to know how can protect our information so I thought the basics of the information security in subject Informatics I. for the mechanical engineering students in the first semester because they do not have any subject which would include information about this topic. The students filled out an information security awareness questionnaire after the second semester. The multidimensional analysis shows which communication systems are more important to the students. These communications systems are protected by password authentication it means the next step of the analysis how long and how complicated password are used by students after the basic information security course in the first semester. The students had to say, how long password they are using by the most important systems like e-mail, community sites, and so on. The longer password is safer then shorter as we know. The following important question is how complicated is the used password. Is it include just lowercase letters, or include some uppercase letters too? Is it include maybe numbers or special characters like ';' or ','? We need to know some more information about the used passwords. How often change the students these passwords? Are they using same passwords by different systems or one same password? In that case if they use same password it is more important to be the password complicated in other case if it is hacked, the attackers can log on in other systems too what the students use. After the analysis I could see how effective was the basic information security course for the mechanical engineering students. How could I build the information security awareness by them? Was it enough, or should I waste more time on this topic to help them to keep save the sensitive data? © 2016 IEEE.","analysis; awareness; higher education; information security; mechanical engineering; students","Authentication; Education; Engineering education; Mechanical engineering; Personal computing; Security of data; Technology transfer; analysis; awareness; Communications systems; Higher education; Information security awareness; Mechanical engineering students; Multi-dimensional analysis; Password authentication; Students"

However, due to essential differences of the classical and quantum world, classical program verification techniques and tools cannot be applied directly to the quantum system. Since quantum programming language is a new formal model of quantum system, the verification problem of quantum program is more urgent and necessary. We investigate the program verification for the reachable set and the terminating set of specific nondeterministic quantum program described respectively by bit flip channel, phase flip channel, depolarizing channel, amplitude damping channel and phase damping channel starting from computational basic states in quantum communication systems. Then, we combine pairwise the above five quantum programs into nondeterministic quantum programs, and merge these nondeterministic quantum programs into three nondeterministic quantum programs in terms of the similarities of the reachable set of five quantum programs, and discuss the problem for termination and divergence of these three nondeterministic quantum programs starting from computational basic states. The results shows that these three nondeterministic quantum programs starting from computational basic state 0 are terminated, while starting from computational basic state 1, the termination and the divergence of nondeterministic quantum program consisted by bit flip channel and depolarizing channel relates to the two parameters describing two quantum channels, the termination and the divergence of nondeterministic quantum program consisted by bit flip channel and phase flip channel relates to one parameter describing bit flip channel, and nondeterministic quantum program consisted by amplitude damping channel and phase damping channel is divergence without the two parameters describing quantum channel.

However, its huge expansion globally has created some serious safety issues, which require a special approach. One of these issues and perhaps the most important one concerns the safety of children on the Internet, as they are more exposed to dangers and threats in comparison with adults. In order to design effective measures against these threats and dangers deep understanding of minors' activities on the Internet, along with their motivation, is a first necessary step. It is shown in this report that minors' Internet activity tends heavily, and in an increasing manner, towards Online Social Networks (OSN). Thus, Internet filtering techniques designed and applied so far for child online protection need to be reconsidered and redesigned in a smarter way such as data analytics, advanced content analysis and data mining techniques are incorporated. OSN fake account identification, sexual content detection and flagging of multiple OSN accounts of the same person are examples that require such sophisticated techniques. This study deals with a literature review concerning the Internet activity and motivation of use by minors and presents in a coherent manner the identified risks and threats that children using the web and online social networks are exposed to. It also presents a systematic process for designing and developing modern and state of the art techniques to prevent minors' exposure to those risks and dangers. © 2016 IEEE.","cybersecurity risks; minors; online social networks; online threats; privacy; taxonomy","Data mining; Data privacy; Explosions; Motivation; Online systems; Semantics; Taxonomies; Cyber security; Effective measures; Literature reviews; minors; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSN); Online threats; State-of-the-art techniques; Social networking (online)"

The study aim was to assess Swedish IT/MT staff experiences regarding regulations for medical devices and medical information systems. Methods An anonymous, ten-item, self-report questionnaire was administered to IT and MT staff (N=228) who attended a 3-h training course on IT and information security and MT regulations in 2014. Results Most of the 228 (86%) IT and MT staff who completed the survey strongly agreed that IT security and MT security are relevant to patient safety. One third of the IT staff reported feeling that their knowledge about regulations within MT was sufficient. Less than half of the respondents experienced that healthcare professionals generally had sufficient knowledge of IT or MT regulations (41% versus 46%, IT and MT regulations, respectively). Conclusions Although IT/MT staff felt that they had knowledge of regulations for medical devices and medical information systems, they reported that maintaining and increasing this knowledge is important and that there is a need for recurring training programs in IT and MT regulations. Improved knowledge in IT and MT regulation, and a better understanding of clinical healthcare, could lead to an increased quality in the daily operations and support to the healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals may need education to develop their knowledge of IT or MT regulations, which in turn will ensure higher patient safety. © 2016 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine","Healthcare information security; Healthcare technology; Knowledge; Patient safety; Regulation; Staff attitudes","adult; Article; descriptive research; female; health care personnel; health care quality; health personnel attitude; human; information technology; job experience; knowledge; male; medical device; medical information system; medical technology; middle aged; patient safety; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; self report; staff; Sweden; training; young adult"

As the information environment has become more diverse and inclusive, security concern has shifted from information assets resided in the organisation to information assets and networked devices exposed to broader cyberspace, such as cloud or Internet of things environment and mobile Internet. Organisations have to keep up with the knowledge and trends in information security and cyber-security to safeguard their information assets. Knowledge mapping will aid in this sort of knowledge management process. Mandatory standards and government regulations help industries establish best practices in cyber-security. Knowledge mapping and scientometric analysis across disciplines also provide a tracking system to notify researchers and practitioners should the new solutions and technology facilitating threat detection emerge. While various topics in information security and cyber-security have been extensively investigated in academia, identifying salient themes and development trajectories in information security and cyber-security research is relatively unexplored. This study employs scientometric analysis and topic modelling to develop knowledge maps that visualise core concepts associated with information security and cyber-security research over time and across disciplines. With scientometric analysis and knowledge mapping using topic models, this study identifies the commonality, difference, and relationship between information security and cyber-security research domains.

This study investigates the consequences of alternative legal regimes on online transaction security, with a specific focus on burden of proof. The two types of online transaction regulations are analyzed by comparing the profits of transacting firms (merchants) and their optimal levels of investment in security. Our findings show that in a market where investments in security are highly effective, a legal regime that imposes the burden of proof on the merchant will enable them to achieve higher profits than will a legal regime that places the onus on the customer. In addition, depending on the effectiveness of investments in online transaction security in a given market, even when firms invest less in security, firms will be more profitable under a legal regime that imposes the burden of proof on the merchant, compared with a framework that imposes it on the customer. Furthermore, our findings imply that, depending on the effectiveness of investments in online transaction security in a given market, firms could have an incentive to invest more in security and such an action could yield higher social welfare when burden of proof is imposed on firms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Burden of proof; Fraudulent online transactions; Information security; Internet security breach; Online business law; Optimal investment in security","E-learning; Electronic commerce; Global system for mobile communications; Laws and legislation; Profitability; Security of data; Burden of proof; Internet security; Online business; Online transaction; Optimal investments; Investments"

These systems are increasingly connected with both private and public networks, making them susceptible to disruption or destruction by adversaries anywhere in the world. Attacks such as the Stuxnet worm have highlighted CPS vulnerabilities and motivated the development of CPS-specific defenses. The lab modules described in this paper arose from a project initially focused on technology to counter a Stuxnet-class attack on a CPS, and the suitability of this technology's commercial off-the-shelf components for undergraduate education was later realized. CPS security is not given much attention in undergraduate programs because networks and control systems are traditionally distinct areas of study. We have developed hands-on courseware to show how an adversary can compromise a CPS in a Stuxnet-like manner by tunneling through a layered sequence of network protocol and interface weaknesses. The courseware incorporates cyber-physical security concepts into effective learning modules that highlight real-world technical issues. This modular learning approach helps students understand CPS architectures and their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks via experiential learning, and acquire practical skills through actively participating in the hands-on exercises. This courseware uses an economical and easily replicable hardware testbed, making this experience available as an adjunct to conventional embedded system, control system design, or cybersecurity courses. To assess the impact of this courseware, an evaluation survey is developed to measure the understanding of the unique aspects of CPS security. These modules leverage existing academic subjects, help students understand the sequence of steps taken by adversaries, and serve to bridge theory and practice. © 2016 IEEE.","Control systems; Cyber-Physical Systems; Cybersecurity; Embedded security; Embedded systems; Hands-on learning; Modular education; Security lab; Trust","Control systems; Control theory; Curricula; E-learning; Education; Embedded systems; Engineering education; Industrial waste treatment; Industrial water treatment; Network layers; Network protocols; Students; Waste treatment; Water supply systems; Water treatment; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Cyber security; Embedded security; Hands-on learning; Security lab; Trust; Network security"

Secure identification is needed for accessing confidential government information, online bank transaction, person's social network (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin). Brain signal electroencephalogram (EEG) can play a vital role in ensuring security as it is non-vulnerable and hard to steal. In this article, we develop an EEG based biometric security system. The purpose of this work is to find the best band or the best bands combination of overt mental stimuli of brain EEG signal to identify a person. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to extract different significant features which separate Alpha, Beta and Theta band of frequencies of the EEG signal. Extracted EEG features of different bands and their combinations such as alpha-beta, alpha-theta, theta-beta, alpha-beta-theta are classified using an artificial neural network (ANN) trained with the back propagation (BP) algorithm. The classification rate shows that Alpha band (84.4%) has higher mapping precision and better convergence rate than the other bands, beta (80%), theta (78.1%) and bands combination as alpha-beta (64.1%), alpha-theta (65.6%), beta-theta (58.8%), alpha-beta-theta (56.9%). Another classifier K nearest neighbor (KNN) is used to verify this result. The classification result of this KNN classifier also shows that alpha band (50%) has higher convergence rate than other bands, beta (40%) and theta (40%).

A number of standards were developed to improve efficiency of information security departments. One of them is ISO/IEC 27001. It involves requirements to information security management systems which are obligatory for certification. Along with management elements for computers and networks, ISO/IEC 27001 specifies the issues of security policy development, staff relations. Processed information security is one of the crucial issues when creating new data processing centers. Accordingly, reliability and fault-tolerance of data centers in the Uptime Institute's Tier Classification System are paid special attention to. Operational Sustainability is an additional characteristics to asses DPC's performance. Advantage of the standard is due to the flexibility of its requirements which enable objective evaluation of DPC's performance at the design stage and comparison of the current performance. Data centers can be awarded with Tier 1 to 4 depending upon the degree of reliability. Tiers is progressive: each Tier incorporates the requirements of all the lower Tiers. The Uptime Institute also developed Tier Standard: Topology and Tier Standard: Operational Sustainability which specify the methods of DPC performance evaluation. The article analyzes the key points of these standards, their advantages and implementation experience in Russian organizations. © 2016 IEEE.","confidentiality; data centers (DC); data processing centers (DPC); information protection; information security; information technologies; operational sustainability; security; standard; tier","Data handling; Data warehouses; Fault tolerance; Human resource management; Information technology; Public policy; Quality management; Security of data; Security systems; Standards; Sustainable development; confidentiality; Data centers; Data processing centers; Information protection; Operational sustainability; security; tier; Information management"

For students at this age, their teachers can serve as models. Through understanding teachers' information security behavioral intentions and related protection motivation, we can design training programs for teachers and hence increase teachers' as well as students' normative judgment with regard to information security behavior. The purpose of this research is to explore those factors that relate to teachers' information security behavior as grounded in Protection Motivation Theory.

To mitigate these concerns, several information assurance mechanisms (e.g., assurance statements and third-party certifications) have gained attention in practice. Despite the wide deployment of assurance mechanisms, it remains largely unknown as to how online consumers interpret these assurance mechanisms and how their concerns affect their purchase decisions. Focusing on two information security assurance mechanisms (i.e., assurance statements and third-party assurance seals services) and three focal concerns of online consumers (i.e., privacy, security, and product and service concerns), this study investigates how security assurance mechanisms influence purchase decisions through alleviating the three focal concerns. The empirical results of the study reveal the relative strength and weakness of the two assurance mechanisms and also uncover the mediating roles of the focal concerns between assurance mechanisms and online consumers’ purchase intentions. Post hoc analysis further shows that assurance seals supplement the effects of assurance statements on privacy concern and product and service concern, which is also a new finding to the literature. Finally, results show that concerns on security and privacy displace concern on product and service (a non-information security concern), when effects of the three concerns are concurrently considered by consumers. The implications of findings for both theory and practice are discussed. © 2016","Assurance statements; Privacy concern; Product and service concern; Security assurance mechanisms; Security concern; Third-party assurance seals","Electronic commerce; Security of data; Assurance statements; Privacy concerns; Product and services; Security assurance; Security concern; Third-party assurance; Sales"

We consider two objectives: (1) the multipath routing scheme for maximising the energy efficiency with security constraints and (2) the multipath routing scheme for maximising the secrecy capacity. The binary erasure channel model is adopted to describe the wireless channel states among neighbouring nodes. Based on the binary erasure channel model, the problem of multipath routing degrades to a problem of bit allocation for each path. We formulate the problems and find that the problems are both quasi-convex. For the first one, it is a linear fractional optimisation problem. The optimal solution is obtained by the Charnes-Cooper transformation. For the second one, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain the η-optimal solution. The performance analysis shows that the probability of the secure bit allocation increases along with the number of multipaths and decreases along with the number of hops per path and eavesdroppers. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithms. © The Author(s) 2016.","Binary erasure channel; information security; multipath routing; multiple hops","Bins; Codes (symbols); Communication channels (information theory); Energy efficiency; Iterative methods; Network routing; Optimal systems; Optimization; Routing protocols; Security of data; Wireless sensor networks; Binary erasure channel; Bit allocation scheme; Charnes-Cooper transformation; Multi path routing; Multi-path routing schemes; Multiple hops; Optimisation problems; Performance analysis; Network security"

Semantic cyberattacks, also known as social engineering, manipulates human users’ perceptions and interpretation of computer-generated data to obtain non-public confidential data. The cyber battleground has shifted from an attack on hard assets to a much softer target: the human mind. If human behavior is the new and last “weakest link” in the cybersecurity armor, is it possible to build cognitive defenses at the intersection of human-machine interactions? The answer is yes, but the change that is needed requires a new way of thinking about security, data governance and strategy. The concepts referenced in the Cognitive Risk Framework for Cybersecurity (CRFC) are drawn from a large body of research in multidisciplinary topics. Cognitive risk management is a sister discipline of a parallel body of science called Cognitive Informatics Security or CogSec. It is also important to point out as the creator of the CRFC, the principles and practices prescribed herein are borrowed from cognitive informatics security, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and behavioral and cognitive science, among just a few that are still evolving.

Arguably (to date) in 2016, the world could consider itself fortunate not to have witnessed a devastating cyber-terrorist attack on an aircraft. Certainly concerns were raised after the disappearance of MH370 in terms of cockpit tampering; and yet, these reports only touched upon the surface of an effervescing iceberg – set to erupt into a tsunami of devastation.

Within 30 years, cyberspace evolved from a graphic representation of all computerised data in a sci-fi novel to being ‘the dominant platform for life in the 21st century’.2 From laptops to smartphones and common house appliances, the range of devices connecting individuals and enabling data transfer has not only grown exponentially, but it has also become considerably diverse. According to Europol, there were 8.7 billion devices connected to the internet in 2012, a figure that had grown to 10 billion in 2014, and is projected to increase to 50 billion by 2020.3 The Internet of Things4 alone is expected to connect 26 billion devices by 2020, according to the Digital Single Market Strategy.5 The coming into being of cyberspace and its widespread adoption have been openly welcomed and cheered, given its perceived contribution to 1 W. Gibson, Neuromancer (Harper Voyager, 1982). 2 Hammersley, as cited in P.W. Singer and A. Friedman, Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs To Know (Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 15. 3 Europol, ‘EC3 First Annual Report’ (2014); Europol, ‘iOCTA: The Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment’ (2014). 4 The Internet of Things is ‘where physical objects are seamlessly integrated into the information network, and where the physical objects can become active participants in business processes [… and] might also serve as backbone for ubiquitous computing, enabling smart environments to recognize and identify objects, and retrieve information from the Internet to facilitate their adaptive functionality’. In other words, the Internet of Things is the capacity of physical appliances (such as an oven or a car) to transmit data within a given network. The risks associated with it were recently visible in a Wired experiment where a Jeep Cherokee was remotely hacked, leading to the recall of 1.4 million cars in the US according to A.

If the Air Force is to maintain control over its information and act beyond the constraints imposed by a contested cyberspace environment, then it must embrace additional, alternative methods of protecting certain critical information during periods of conflict. These methods might even stand in opposition to traditional notions of cybersecurity but would protect information through a fuller understanding of the advantages found in certain areas of the Internet’s “topography.” This article proposes one such method that involves using “dark web” peer-to-peer networks as the basis for storing and sharing information with an infrastructure built on commercial systems.

Recently, however, autocratic regimes took control of the Internet and filter online content. Building on the literature concerning the political economy of repression, this article argues that regime characteristics, economic conditions, and conflict in bordering states account for variation in Internet filtering levels among autocratic regimes. Using OLS-regression, the article analyzes the determinants of Internet filtering as measured by the Open Net Initiative in 34 autocratic regimes. The results show that monarchies, regimes with higher levels of social unrest, regime changes in neighboring countries, and less oppositional competition in the political arena are more likely to filter the Internet. The article calls for a systematic data collection to analyze the causal mechanisms and the temporal dynamics of Internet filtering.

In addition to technology components, Internet environment can be viewed as a complex economic system consisting of firms, hackers, government sectors and other participants, whose economic incentives should be taken into account carefully when security solutions are formulated. In order to better protect information assets, information security economics as an emerging and thriving research branch emerges aiming at attempting to solve the problems of distorted incentives of such stakeholders by means of economic approaches. However, how these participants’ economic incentives for information security improvement change when they evolve between different market structures has remained unknown yet. Using game theory, we develop an analytical framework to investigate the effects of market structures on security investments, information sharing, attack investments, expected profits, expected consumer surplus and expected social welfare. We demonstrate that the levels of security investments, information sharing, attack investments, and expected profits are higher while expected consumer surplus and expected social welfare are lower under Cournot competition than under Bertrand competition. In particular, we surprisingly find that under either type of competition, the demand switch ratio caused by security breaches may benefit firms, consumers, government sectors and harm hackers.

As exit code was used to indicate the test results, vulnerability test scripts could be written in any executable programming language, and could be shared by similar vulnerabilities. Open data interfaces were developed to allow integration of this platform with other IT asset and workflow management systems.

We also find that a risk taking firm may invest a larger amount in protecting a set than the risk neutral firm when the effectiveness of the investment in lowering breach probability is low. Finally, we show that for a group of information sets of equal value and varying vulnerabilities, the risk neutral decision maker will diversify security investment to a greater extent than the risk taker. As a result, the risk taker will invest a larger amount than the risk neutral firm would when protecting the high risk sets in the group.

In comparison with the commonly used image encryption algorithm, the experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm requires less amount of calculation, while simultaneously provides larger algorithm key space and more sensitive key. © 2016 IEEE.","DCT transformation; frequency domain; human face detection; identification photo; image encryption; information security; Logistic map; multilayer block scrambling","Face recognition; Frequency domain analysis; Image processing; Security of data; Signal processing; Wireless telecommunication systems; DCT transformation; Frequency domains; Human face detection; Image encryptions; Logistic maps; Cryptography"

Because warnings require users to make a contextual judgment, it is critical that they pay close attention to warnings. However, research shows that users routinely disregard them. A major factor contributing to the ineffectiveness of warnings is habituation, the decreased response to a repeated warning. Although previous research has identified the problem of habituation, the phenomenon has only been observed indirectly through behavioral measures. Therefore, it is unclear how habituation develops in the brain in response to security warnings, and how this in turn influences users’ perceptions of these warnings. This paper contributes by using eye tracking to measure the eye movement-based memory (EMM) effect, a neurophysiological manifestation of habituation in which people unconsciously scrutinize previously seen stimuli less than novel stimuli. We show that habituation sets in after only a few exposures to a warning and progresses rapidly with further repetitions. Using guidelines from the warning science literature, we design a polymorphic warning artifact which repeatedly changes its appearance. We demonstrate that our polymorphic warning artifact is substantially more resistant to habituation than conventional security warnings, offering an effective solution for practice. Finally, our results highlight the value of applying neuroscience to the domain of information security behavior. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioral information security; Eye tracking; Habituation; NeuroIS; Security warnings","Security of data; Target tracking; Behavioral information security; Eye-tracking; Habituation; NeuroIS; Security warning; Eye movements"

The recent targeted attacks extensively use non-executable malware as a stealthy attack vector. There exists a substantial body of previous work on the detection of non-executable malware, including static, dynamic, and combined methods. While static methods perform orders of magnitude faster, their applicability has been hitherto limited to specific file formats. This paper introduces Hidost, the first static machine-learning-based malware detection system designed to operate on multiple file formats. Extending a previously published, highly effective method, it combines the logical structure of files with their content for even better detection accuracy. Our system has been implemented and evaluated on two formats, PDF and SWF (Flash). Thanks to its modular design and general feature set, it is extensible to other formats whose logical structure is organized as a hierarchy. Evaluated in realistic experiments on timestamped datasets comprising 440,000 PDF and 40,000 SWF files collected during several months, Hidost outperformed all antivirus engines deployed by the website VirusTotal to detect the highest number of malicious PDF files and ranked among the best on SWF malware. © 2016, The Author(s).","File formats; Machine learning; Malware detection; PDF; Security; SWF","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Learning systems; Personal computing; Security of data; Anti-virus engines; Detection accuracy; File formats; Logical structure; Malware detection; Modular designs; Orders of magnitude; Security; Malware"

A portion of small-cell base stations (SBSs) acts as the friendly jammer to help improving macro-users’secrecy rate by transmitting interference signal on the wiretap channel. In return, the client macro-user pays to its jammers for the jamming power that they provide. Instead of transmitting noise as traditional jammers do, this paper proposes a modified spectrum leasing method, which allows SBSs to replace the thermal noise with their own traffic. This approach also permits the jamming SBSs to access extra spectrum in order to enhance the performance. In the considered scenario, the macro-user tries to find the SBSs that can mostly protect its confidential message, while each SBS decides whether to serve as a jammer or not. Once an SBS decides to be a jammer, it needs to choose the optimal client macro-user depending on the channel condition. This two-way selection problem between SBSs and macro-users is modeled as the coalition formation game with non-transferable utility, and a distributed scheme is proposed for this game, in which the players (macro-users and SBSs) individually make a decision and converge to a Nash-stable partition in a self-organized manner. The simulation results show that the majority of macro-user equipments enjoy a fivefold increment in average secrecy rate and that the friendly jammer scheme effectively protects the macro-users from the eavesdropper. At the same time, the average capacity of small-cell layer also achieves a 16.92 % improvement. © 2016, The Author(s).","Coalition formation game; Friendly jammer; Information security; Ultra-dense networks","Heterogeneous networks; Security of data; Coalition formation games; Confidential message; Dense network; Distributed schemes; Friendly jammer; Friendly jammer selections; Nash stable partitions; Non-transferable utilities; Jamming"

Background: Phishing attacks are difficult to prevent with technology alone, as long as technology is operated by people. Those responsible for managing security risks must understand user decision making in order to create and evaluate potential solutions. Method: Using a scenario-based online task, we performed two experiments comparing performance on two tasks: detection, deciding whether an e-mail is phishing, and behavior, deciding what to do with an e-mail. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the order of the tasks and notification of the phishing base rate. In Experiment 2, we varied which task participants performed. Results: In both experiments, despite exhibiting cautious behavior, participants' limited detection ability left them vulnerable to phishing attacks. Greater sensitivity was positively correlated with confidence. Greater willingness to treat e-mails as legitimate was negatively correlated with perceived consequences from their actions and positively correlated with confidence. These patterns were robust across experimental conditions. Conclusion: Phishing-related decisions are sensitive to individuals' detection ability, response bias, confidence, and perception of consequences. Performance differs when people evaluate messages or respond to them but not when their task varies in other ways. Application: Based on these results, potential interventions include providing users with feedback on their abilities and information about the consequences of phishing, perhaps targeting those with the worst performance. Signal detection methods offer system operators quantitative assessments of the impacts of interventions and their residual vulnerability. © 2016 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","cybersecurity; metacognition; perception-action; signal detection theory; vigilance","Adult; Deception; Decision Making; Electronic Mail; Humans; Signal Detection, Psychological; Task Performance and Analysis; Behavioral research; Computer crime; Decision making; Electronic mail; Cyber security; Metacognition; Perception-action; Signal detection theory; vigilance; alertness; controlled study; decision making; e-mail; experimental model; human; human experiment; metacognition; quantitative study; signal detection; adult; deception; decision making; e-mail; perceptive discrimination; physiology; task performance; Signal detection"

We develop, analyse, and validate the models of the identified attacks followed by the development of a new SAW model to resist those attacks. The identified attack models generalize three main security levels that capture all the possible counterfeiting instances. We focus on the block-wise dependent fragile watermarking schemes, and their general weaknesses. Experimental results successfully demonstrate the practicality and consequences of the identified attacks in exploiting those weaknesses to maliciously and undetectably alter valid watermarked images. To resist the identified attacks, we further determine a set of general requirements for SAW schemes and illustrate their attainment in developing an extended SAW model. While the identified attack models can be used as a means to systematically examine the security levels of similar SAW schemes, the extended SAW model may lead to developing their more secure variants. Our study has also revealed some open challenges in the development and formal analysis of SAW schemes. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Counterfeiting attack; Fragile watermarking; Information assurance; Multimedia security; Self-authentication","Authentication; Counterfeiting attack; Fragile watermarking; Information assurance; Multimedia security; Self-authentication; Watermarking"

It is one of the most important technical and policy challenges in cybersecurity. The lack of ground truth for an individual responsible for an attack has limited previous studies. In this paper, we take a first step towards overcoming this limitation by building a dataset from the capture-the-flag event held at DEFCON, and propose an argumentation model based on a formal reasoning framework called DeLP (Defeasible Logic Programming) designed to aid an analyst in attributing a cyber-attack.

However, within the context of information security, these models are not applicable and fail to accurately assess the circumstances in which an individual engages in protective security behaviors beyond an initial adoption. This research addresses this gap and establishes a model for explaining an individual's continued engagement in protective security behaviors, which is a significant problem in securing enterprise information resources. Within this model, protection motivation theory (PMT) is considered an underlying theoretical motivation for continuance intention using constructs such as perceived threat severity, perceived threat susceptibility, self-efficacy, and response efficacy as direct antecedents of behavioral intents and indirect predictors of continuance behavior. Furthermore, the introduction of perceived extraneous circumstances is used to reconcile the “acceptance–discontinuance anomaly.” A novel research methodology for measuring actual security behavior continuance was developed for this investigation. Experimental results indicate support for all of the proposed relationships, with the exception of response efficacy—continuance intent. Nearly half of the variance in the dependent variable, continuance behavior, was explained by the model. This is the first comprehensive empirical investigation of protective security behavior continuance intention. The findings have practical implications for security administrators and security technology solution providers, and they have theoretical ramifications in the area of behavioral information security and protection motivation theory. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Adoption; Behavior; Continuance; Information assurance; Perceived extraneous circumstances; Security","Security of data; Adoption; Behavior; Continuance; Information assurance; Perceived extraneous circumstances; Security; Motivation"

The collaboration within dynamic business networks necessitates forming dynamic networked business processes (DNBPs). Networked business processes need to be supported by high quality information that is exchanged in a trustworthy environment. Information governance (IG) is described as a holistic approach to different mechanisms that support high quality and secure information exchanges. However, dynamism of networked business processes causes IG issues like unsecured information access and low quality information products to emerge. In this paper, a comprehensive list of the IG issues in DNBPs is identified through structured steps. The identified IG issues are characterized within four main categories, respectively, information product quality, information service quality, information security, and metadata issues. For the evaluation of the practical significance of the identified IG issues, a case study is conducted in a business network that provides mobility solutions. In this way, the paper closes the gap between studies on IG, which have mostly concentrated on IG within the borders of a single organization or IG in stable business networks, and studies on dynamic business networks, which have addressed the formation of dynamic inter-organizational interactions without paying rigorous attention to information artefacts that are exchanged. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Dynamic business network; information governance; information quality; information security; metadata; networked business process",""

This should come as no surprise, as these systems represent one of the most rapidly growing areas of innovative technology adoption. In the military trade space the use of military unmanned systems (UxS) is already creating strategic, operational, and tactical possibilities that did not exist a decade ago. But as each military Service, and each branch within that Service, conceive, design and build their own autonomous systems, the disciplines brought to bear to ensure that these systems both meet warfighters needs and also comport with legal, moral and ethical norms can narrow. In other words, there is a need for a mulitadisciplinary organization that can provide for an exchange of expertise and ideas across all military organizations, industry, academia and other fields. Absent that sort of organization, it is likely that autonomous systems will be designed for military use that either don't meet military requirements, or, if they do so, cannot be used without undue risk to civilians. In 2011, then-Undersecretary of the Navy (now-Deputy Secretary of Defense) Robert Work established the Naval Postgraduate School Consortium for Robotics and Unmanned Systems Education and Research (CRUSER). The impetus behind establishing this organization was to create and nourish a collaborative environment and community of interest for the advancement of unmanned systems (UxS) education and research endeavors across the Navy, Marine Corps, and Department of Defense. CRUSER represents an initiative designed to build an inclusive community of interest around the application of UxS in military operations. CRUSER seeks to catalyze these efforts, both internal and external to NPS, by facilitating active means of collaboration, providing a mechanism for information exchange among researchers and educators with collaborative interests. This process is designed to foster innovation through directed programs of operational experimentation, and supporting the development of an array of educational ventures. CRUSER captures a broad array of issues related to emerging UxS technologies, and encompassing the successful research, education, and experimentation efforts in UxS currently ongoing at NPS and across the military enterprise. Controls, sensors, design, architectures, human capital resource requirements, concept generation, risk analysis, cybersecurity, and field experimentation are just a few of the areas where CRUSER has equities. The success of this collaborative organization is measured not only in its growing membership, focused research and enhanced experimentation, but in the inclusiveness of its dialogue among academics, industry professionals, military officials, and the policy and legal community. CRUSER's focus has recently shifted from creating a self-sustaining community of interest to impacting the larger naval and defense communities. CRUSER supported classroom projects designed provide input for larger naval war games as well as provide direct feedback to operators and engineers in the fleet and at warfare centers. Workshops on the ethics of employing UxS, cost models for unmanned maritime systems, and The Future of Just War conference put critical (non-technological) issues under the spotlight for examination by hundreds of academics, warfighters and policy makers. CRUSER funded researchers have worked to developing methods to accomplish critical research using operational risk methodologies for flight safety. This has led to CRUSER successfully flying the world's first fifty-UAV autonomous swarm; and conducting flight, surface and submerged operations in extreme environments. This paper will present the results of CRUSER's most recent academic and field experimentation work, especially its ongoing swarm vs. swarm work in calendar year 2106. We believe this insider's look at the way the U.S. military is coordinating its autonomous systems work across a wide-array of disciplines will suggest a way-ahead to the autonomous community writ large. Further, by exposing CRUSER's work to the larger MTX/IEEE Oceans community, we believe we can establish a broader-based and more-informed dialogue between and among military and civilian UxS users. The overarching goal of these efforts is to ensure that the design and employment of autonomous systems in both the civilian and military communities proceeds as fast and as far as technology can take these systems, while allaying concerns that these systems perform the way the humans who create them intend for them to.","","Education; Electronic trading; Fleet operations; Marine education; Military operations; Naval warfare; Network security; Oceanography; Philosophical aspects; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Collaborative environments; Collaborative organizations; Department of Defense; Education and researches; Human capital resources; Industry professionals; Military organizations; Multiple autonomous vehicles; Military applications"

Transferring layer in traditional user datagram protocol is implemented by publishing and subscribing scheme of message middleware. By creating message model to standardize message structure, integration architecture is formulated to resolve potential information security risks from inconsistent data type and express data transmission. Meanwhile, a communication model is put forward based on AMQP, which is in the center position of the whole transmission framework and responsible for reliably transferring battlefield data among subsystems.

Selye University in Slovakia. Because there are sensitive data about children stored in the kindergarten (e.g. home address, parents' details, medical records, etc.), it deeply matters how careful is the data stored. Thorough data protection is important in order to avoid the digitally stored information to be viewable by other persons, who can use them for malicious purposes (e.g. social engineering, kidnapping, murder) (Keszthelyi, 2013). This requires appropriate care and protection of storage and handling. In our research we wanted to know what level of information security awareness characterizes the kindergarten teacher-education students, whether they are aware of the basic data protection aspects. The study assesses what kind of online services they use and what level of protection they use in these services for their own data. At the end of our analysis we concluded that many of them are not aware of the essential data and information protection. The data they have stored can be very easily obtained.

One such knowledge is the time-related vulnerabilities that signify the increasing risk of the system through time.

This paper presents a biometric recognition system which can be embedded in any system involving access control, e-commerce, online banking, computer login etc. to enhance the security. Fingerprint is an old and mature technology which has been used in this work as biometric trait. In this paper a fingerprint recognition system based on no minutiae features: Fuzzy features and Invariant moment features has been developed. Fingerprint images from FVC2002 are used for experimentation. The images are enhanced for improving the quality and a region of interest (ROI) is cropped around the core point. Two sets of features are extracted from ROI and support vector machine (SVM) is used for verification. An accuracy of 95 per cent is achieved with the invariant moment features using RBF kernel in SVM. © 2016, DESIDOC.","Biometrics; Cyber security; Fingerprint recognition; Fuzzy features; Invariant moment features","Access control; Computer control systems; Cybersecurity; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Palmprint recognition; Support vector machines; Cyber security; Daily lives; Fingerprint Recognition; Fuzzy features; Invariant moment; Invariant moment feature; Moment features; Region-of-interest; Regions of interest; Support vectors machine; Biometrics"

In this study, the local LR attack is mathematically modeled as a bilevel optimization problem. The long-term occurrence frequency of local LR attacks is represented by the power law distribution. Considering the difficulty and consequence of each attack region, probability of choosing the valid attack region is calculated.

This process is called role mining. However, not all the topologies of bipartite networks are suitable for role mining; some edges may even reduce the quality of role mining. This causes unnecessary time consumption as role mining is NP-hard. Therefore, to promote the quality of role mining results, the capability that an edge composes roles with other edges, called the minability of edge, needs to be identified. We tackle the problem from an angle of edge importance in complex networks; that is an edge easily covered by roles is considered to be more important. Based on this idea, the k-shell decomposition of complex networks is extended to reveal the different minability of edges. By this way, a bipartite network can be quickly purified by excluding the low-minability edges from role mining, and thus the quality of role mining can be effectively improved. Extensive experiments via the real-world datasets are conducted to confirm the above claims. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bipartite network; Edge minability; Information management; Role mining","Access control; Information management; Bipartite network; Edge minability; K-shells; Real-world datasets; Role minings; Role-based Access Control; Time consumption; Complex networks"

Interest in these methods is intensifying, accelerated by the ease with which digitized data can be acquired in virtually all fields of endeavour, from science, healthcare and cybersecurity to economics, social sciences and the humanities. In multiscale modelling, machine learning appears to provide a shortcut to reveal correlations of arbitrary complexity between processes at the atomic, molecular, meso-and macroscales. Here, we point out the weaknesses of pure big data approaches with particular focus on biology and medicine, which fail to provide conceptual accounts for the processes to which they are applied. No matter their 'depth' and the sophistication of data-driven methods, such as artificial neural nets, in the end they merely fit curves to existing data. Not only do these methods invariably require far larger quantities of data than anticipated by big data aficionados in order to produce statistically reliable results, but they can also fail in circumstances beyond the range of the data used to train them because they are not designed to model the structural characteristics of the underlying system. We argue that it is vital to use theory as a guide to experimental design for maximal efficiency of data collection and to produce reliable predictive models and conceptual knowledge. Rather than continuing to fund, pursue and promote 'blind' big data projects with massive budgets, we call for more funding to be allocated to the elucidation of the multiscale and stochastic processes controlling the behaviour of complex systems, including those of life, medicine and healthcare.

The primary purpose of the BPCS is as an active, continuous system that controls level, pressure, temperature and other process variables designed to keep the hazardous materials in the process under control within the safe operating envelope, while efficiently and cost-effectively making on-spec product. The vast majority of SISs, on the other hand, operate as passive systems that sit there doing nothing until a safety demand occurs. When the process exceeds its safe operating limits, the SIS acts to maintain or bring the process to a safe state. The BPCS will have tens of thousands of data points and other parameters transferred digitally between BPCS boxes via multiple paths, where the SIS may have a few hundred data points, mostly reads with a limited number of writes. To get a high-level view of SIS and its potential vulnerabilities, one must draw a boundary around all the SIS assets. Then, identify all of the communications paths and any other data, remote or physical access paths that cross that boundary. Use of the zones and conduit concept, defense in depth, and the torturous path concepts are steps in the right direction. The standards in this area have a steep learning curve, and with the ever-changing cyber threat environment, may require a specialist to keep up.","","Accident prevention; Control systems; Intelligent control; Surveying instruments; Basic process control systems; Continuous system; Defense in depth; Industrial control systems; Operating limit; Process Variables; Safety instrumented systems; Steep learning curve; Process control"

Owing to the limitation of service node's antennas, not all users can be concurrently served. Therefore, the node only provides services for some chosen users in a certain time. On the basis of this premise, in our scheme, the access status of each user is involved. With the information of access status, the node devises transmitters to increase the served users' transmission rates and decrease the possibility of each idle user's signal interception. Furthermore, the node executes active jamming according to the realistic situation of this multi-user network for confusing the idle users/potential eavesdroppers. In addition, with the gradually mature applications of full-duplex techniques for the terminals, each user can also implement active jamming in the full-duplex mode to interfere with the potential eavesdroppers. It is seen that our scheme is linear without iteration, and performance analysis and simulation results illustrate that it is feasible for multi-user security enhancement.

Due to the characteristics of multi-dimensional operation and parallel processing capability, optical image encryption techniques have been receiving more and more attention. Since the well-known double random phase encoding technique was proposed, many other methods based on optical information processing means such as the use of optical transform, interference, and polarized light encoding, have been proposed for optical image encryption. However, recent researches have demonstrated that traditional optical encryption techniques are symmetric cryptosystems, in which decryption keys are identical to encryption keys and they have been found to be vulnerable to different types of attacks, such as known plaintext and chosen plaintext attacks. To overcome this shortcoming, asymmetric cryptosystems based on nonlinear phase-truncation techniques and phase retrieval algorithm have been proposed. Asymmetric cryptosystem is a cryptographic system in which encryption keys are different from decryption keys. The encryption keys are used as public keys which are disseminated widely, and the decryption keys are used as private keys which are known only to the authorized users. So, asymmetric cryptosystem can offer a higher-level security than symmetric cryptosystem. However, asymmetric cryptosystems based on phase retrieval algorithms require a lot of computational time, and asymmetric cryptosystems based on phase-truncated Fourier transforms have been found to be vulnerable to special attack. Therefore, in this paper, a novel asymmetric image encryption method is proposed by using the gyrator transform and vector operation. The original image is encrypted into two phase masks with vector operation. One is a random phase mask and the other is a phase mask related to the original image. In the encryption process, the random phase mask is used as a phase key and the other phase mask is transformed by gyrator transform. The transform result is performed by Fourier transform after being modulated by a phase distribution. The ciphertext is the amplitude of the above result. Compared with previous encryption schemes, the suggested method has two advantages. Firstly, we have proposed a new asymmetric encryption method based on the gyrator transform and vector operation. The decryption process is different from the encryption process. The gyrator transform and Fourier transform are used in the encryption process, while only the inverse operation of Fourier transform is employed in the decryption process. In addition, the decryption keys produced in the encryption process are different from the encryption keys. Therefore, the proposed scheme has high resistance against the conventional attacks. Secondly, the encrypted result is real-valued, which is convenient for display, transmission and storage. Numerical simulations illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed encryption scheme. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.","Asymmetric encryption; Gyrator transform; Real-valued encryption; Vector operation","Encoding (symbols); Fourier transforms; Geometrical optics; Gyrators; Image processing; Optical data processing; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Vectors; Asymmetric encryption; Computer network technology; Double random-phase encoding; Gyrator transform; Optical encryption technique; Phase retrieval algorithm; Real-valued encryptions; Vector operations; Cryptography"

In addition to that, cloud computing is very complex by itself, because it encompasses numerous technologies and concepts. Apparently, overcoming these challenges requires substantial efforts from information security researchers to develop powerful mitigation solutions for this emerging problem. This entails developing a taxonomy of insider threats in cloud environments encompassing all potential abnormal activities in the cloud and can be useful for conducting security assessment. This article describes the first phase of an ongoing research to develop a framework for mitigating insider threats in cloud computing environments. Primarily, it presents a multidimensional taxonomy of insider threats in cloud computing and demonstrates its viability. The taxonomy provides a fundamental understanding for this complicated problem by identifying five dimensions; it also supports security engineers in identifying hidden paths, thus determining proper countermeasures, and presents a guidance that covers all bounders of insiders' threats issue in clouds; hence, it facilitates researchers' endeavours in tackling this problem. For instance, according to the hierarchical taxonomy, clearly many significant issues exist in public cloud, while conventional insider mitigation solutions can be used in private clouds. Finally, the taxonomy assists in identifying future research directions in this emerging area. © The British Computer Society 2016.

Famous cases of sensitive information leaks caused by insiders, including the WikiLeaks release of diplomatic cables and the Edward Snowden incident, have greatly harmed the U.S. government's relationship with other governments and with its own citizens. Data Leak Prevention (DLP) is a solution for detecting and preventing information leaks from within an organization's network. However, state-of-Art DLP detection models are only able to detect very limited types of sensitive information, and research in the field has been hindered due to the lack of available sensitive texts. Many researchers have focused on document-based detection with artificially labeled 'confidential documents' for which security labels are assigned to the entire document, when in reality only a portion of the document is sensitive. This type of whole-document based security labeling increases the chances of preventing authorized users from accessing non-sensitive information within sensitive documents. In this paper, we introduce Automated Classification Enabled by Security Similarity (ACESS), a new and innovative detection model that penetrates the complexity of big text security classification/detection. To analyze the ACESS system, we constructed a novel dataset, containing formerly classified paragraphs from diplomatic cables made public by the WikiLeaks organization. To our knowledge this paper is the first to analyze a dataset that contains actual formerly sensitive information annotated at paragraph granularity. © 2016 IEEE.","Data Leak; Insider Threats; Machine Learning; Security Classification","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cables; Complex networks; Information science; Learning systems; Authorized users; Automated classification; Data Leak; Detection models; Insider Threat; Security classification; Sensitive documents; Sensitive informations; Text processing"

Due to the flood of arising innovative technologies such as cloud computing or big data, security approaches have constantly evolved toward more sophisticate solutions, aiming to tackle always more complex security issues. Nowadays, integrated frameworks are necessary to manage this complexity. Pattern-based approaches for reusing security solutions have proven its usefulness, but mostly in the frame of simple security matters. Acknowledging this, the scientific community has recently considered how these patterns could also be used to address the complexity caused by the association of multiple security criteria. Approaches based on the combination of ""simple"" security patterns have emerged and have resulted in the elaboration of methods for designing systems of security patterns and systems managing these collections of patterns. Nonetheless, in that domain, we have observed that researches are mostly focused on the definition of security solutions and do not address the complexity of the security requirements yet. In this paper we present a proposal for addressing this issue by means of a framework for engineering reusable security patterns for complex systems called COPERATE (COmPlex sEcurity Requirements pAtTErns).

This phenomenon is called the Cyber Paradox and describes what has become an entrenched battle for security professionals in defending against an increasingly sophisticated adversary that, to date, has adapted faster than defensive measures to prevent loss of data or access to sensitive information. Conventional security defenses have proven less than effective resulting in a virtual “Maginot’s Line” of increased fortification by hardening the enterprise yet resulting in greater vulnerability to achieving the goals of defending the organization from cyber threats (“Maginot’s Line”, n.d.). This article reviews the causes of these misperceptions in security defense and explores research in decision science, intelligence and security informatics, machine learning, and the role of simplicity in shaping a cognitive risk framework. The findings conclude that the human-machine interaction is the greatest threat in cyber space yet very few, if any, security professionals are well versed in strategies to close this gap.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become an essential component of any network architecture, in order to secure an IT infrastructure from the malicious activities of the intruders. An efficient IDS should be able to detect, identify and track the malicious attempts made by the intruders. With many IDSs available in the literature, the most common challenge due to voluminous network traffic patterns is the curse of dimensionality. This scenario emphasises the importance of feature selection algorithm, which can identify the relevant features and ignore the rest without any information loss. A novel rough set ê -Helly property technique (RSKHT) feature selection algorithm had been proposed to identify the key features for network IDSs. Experiments carried using benchmark KDD cup 1999 dataset were found to be promising, when compared with the existing feature selection algorithms with respect to reduct size, classifier's performance and time complexity.

New advances in information technology (IT) have supported innovations in KM. In many studies it has been indicated that using knowledge management techniques (KM), which fundamentally consist of tacit and explicit knowledge capturing, organizing and storing, helps to achieve goals in a shorter time, the level of understanding is increased, the problems are solved efficiently and right decisions are taken in many fields. In number of studies it is emphasized that KM to be used as a tool or concept in education. Motivation of this study was to implement such a platform to collect and deliver tacit and explicit knowledge of information security. Apart from other studies, the developed model not only helps codifying tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge, but also serves as a learning object to be used in the construction of other online education systems. The developed model has an environment similar to Distributed Interactive Learning (DIL). DIL, in brief, is a type of web based education environment based on structured hypertext navigation, rather than just delivering linear learning materials such as Word files and presentation files.

Prior work on this topic assumes that the hacker's effort is independent of the vendor's decision to release the patch freely or not. Clearly, if the patch is not available to everyone, the hacker finds it easier to exploit the vulnerability in the product and, as a result, is likely to alter his effort. To understand the role of a strategic hacker, we build a game-theoretic model, where the hacker's decision is endogenous. With this model, we find that the hacker's effort may, on the one hand, decrease the utility that the vendor can extract from the consumers but, on the other hand, may help differentiate the legal version of the product from the pirated version. A vendor can strategically exploit the hacker's behavior in its pricing and software maintenance decisions. The endogeneity of the hacker's actions drives several of our findings that have interesting policy implications. For example, the vendor may increase the price and reduce market share to exploit the differentiation. In such a case, there may be more pirates in the restricted-patch case than when the patch is freely available, a result that runs counter to typical arguments provided for restricting patches. © 2016 INFORMS.","Countervailing incentive; Information security; Patch distribution; Public policy","Commerce; Competition; Computer software maintenance; Game theory; Public policy; Security of data; Countervailing incentive; Endogeneity; Game-theoretic model; Maintenance decisions; Market share; Patch distribution; Policy implications; Personal computing"

However, firewall performance may affect user experience. Therefore, performance analysis plays a significant role in the evaluation of application layer firewalls. This paper presents an analytic model of the application layer firewall, based on a system analysis to evaluate the capability of the firewall. In order to enable users to improve the performance of the application layer firewall with limited resources, resource allocation was evaluated to obtain the optimal resource allocation scheme in terms of throughput, delay, and packet loss rate. The proposed model employs the Erlangian queuing model to analyze the performance parameters of the system with regard to the three layers (network, transport, and application layers). Then, the analysis results of all the layers are combined to obtain the overall system performance indicators. A discrete event simulation method was used to evaluate the proposed model. Finally, limited service desk resources were allocated to obtain the values of the performance indicators under different resource allocation scenarios in order to determine the optimal allocation scheme. Under limited resource allocation, this scheme enables users to maximize the performance of the application layer firewall. © 2016 Xuan et al.

The possibilities of Big Data analytics to security threat and vulnerability scanning offer a significant development in the protection of infrastructures. At the same time, industry research reports continue to state that the main contributing factor in the events leading to a data breach is human error. The common response of information security professionals is to resort to technological solutions to prevent these human errors. However, some very important information security intelligence is not hidden within the network traffic: it's available from the people that work with sensitive information. This article describes the Health Information risk (HI-risk) method to identify non-technical information security risks in healthcare. The method includes risks related to skills, behaviour, processes, organisational culture, physical security, and external influences. HI-risk offers a solution to collect intelligence about nontechnical information security incidents from across the healthcare sector to demonstrate past trends and to be ahead of future incidents. A test of a HI-risk forecast proved the feasibility of this approach in healthcare and beyond. It is suggested that HI-risk could become a valuable addition to existing technical threat and vulnerability monitoring tools. © 2016 IEEE.","risk model; security intelligence; socio-technical information security","Big data; Errors; Health; Health care; Risk assessment; Security of data; Security systems; Information security incidents; Information security professionals; Information security threats; Organisational culture; Risk model; security intelligence; Sociotechnical; Technological solution; Health risks"

In CRNs, the primary network may decide to lease its own spectrum for a fraction of time to the secondary nodes in exchange of appropriate remuneration. We consider the secondary transmitter node as a trusted relay for primary transmission to forward primary messages in a decode-and-forward fashion and, at the same time, allows part of its available power to be used to transmit artificial noise (i.e., jamming signal) to enhance primary and secondary secrecy rates. In order to allocate power between message and jamming signals, we formulate and solve the optimization problem for maximizing the secrecy rates under malicious attempts from eavesdroppers. We then analyze the cooperation between the primary and secondary nodes from a game-theoretic perspective where we model their interaction as a Stackelberg game with a theoretically proved and computed Stackelberg equilibrium. We show that the spectrum leasing based on trading secondary access for cooperation by means of relay and jammer is a promising framework for enhancing security in CRNs. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; game theory; Information security","Game theory; Jamming; Network layers; Network security; Optimization; Radio transmission; Secure communication; Security of data; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio network (CRN); Decode - and - forwards; Game-theoretic perspectives; Optimization problems; Physical layer security; Primary transmission; Stackelberg equilibrium; Cognitive radio"

Usually, platform administrators collect and ratify vulnerability information, which white hat hackers report at first hand, and users hence know which applications have doubts via vulnerability reports published on the platform. However, there are still few reported but unverified vulnerabilities, which may be caused from scarcity of testing targets and limitation of man power. These vulnerabilities might agitate those users who have related applications. This study initiates crowdsourcing to vulnerability collection platforms. The proposed platform collaborates administrators with two new added roles, script writers and target providers, aiming at vulnerability verification. In addition we design two agents, the test scheduler and the log collector, to automatically arrange test cases and collect logs, respectively. With properly scoring on task assignment, these crowd sources can effectively and efficiently collaborate on verification of timely and severe vulnerabilities. Hence this platform can speed up the progress of vulnerability assessment in information security. © 2016 IEICE.","collaboration management; crowdsourcing platform; vulnerability verification","Personal computing; Security of data; Collaboration management; Crowdsourcing platforms; Speed up; Task assignment; Test case; Two agents; Vulnerability assessments; Crowdsourcing"

The difference lies in the fact that steganography hides the data so that nothing appears out of ordinary while cryptography encrypts the text, making it difficult for an outsider to infer anything from it even if they do attain the encrypted text. Both of them are combined to increase the security against various malicious attacks. Image Steganography uses an image as the cover media to hide the secret message.

Various clustering algorithms can be used for image segmentation. Segmentation involves huge set of data in the form of pixels, where each pixel further has three components namely red, green and blue. K-means clustering technique is used to get accurate results.

Combining vast computational power with intelligent Computer Aided Design (CAD) algorithms, petroleum CPS is capable of precisely modeling the flow of fluids over the entire petroleum reservoir and leveraging the massive field data remotely collected at the production wells. It provides field operators with valuable insights into the geological structure and remaining reserves of the reservoir for optimizing their operational strategies. Despite such benefits, petroleum CPS is vulnerable to various cyberattacks that jeopardize the integrity of the field data collected at production wells. Given manipulated field data, CAD software would generate an inaccurate reservoir model which misleads the field operators. This work is the first to analyze potential cybersecurity attacks in a petroleum CPS. In this paper, an intelligent cyberattack strategy optimization framework is proposed to optimize the malicious manipulation of field data such that the history matching solver generates the most inaccurate reservoir model.

Overcoming this challenge, the paper at hand presents a detailed example of a multifaceted evaluation of a Reference Model of Information Assurance & Security (RMIAS), which summarises the knowledge acquired by the Information Assurance & Security community to date in one all-encompassing model. A combination of analytical and empirical evaluation methods is exploited to evaluate the RMIAS in a sustained way overcoming the limitations of separate methods. The RMIAS is analytically evaluated regarding the quality criteria of conceptual models and compared with existing models. Twenty-six semi-structured interviews with IAS experts are conducted to test the merit of the RMIAS. Three workshops and a case study are carried out to verify the practical value of the model.

These objectives place two particular demands on organizations: to appoint a suitable official to head up their information security operations, a CISO; and to ensure that the executive and board are appropriately informed of the organization's security status. In exploring the challenges that confront organizations in selecting a CISO, we drew on data from the U.S., Canada, and New Zealand. Two main issues were addressed. First, the organization has to be very clear on what it wants in terms of the job the CISO is expected to perform and the corresponding attributes that such an incumbent would need to possess. The CISO is a senior-level executive and rather than being a specialized technical expert, the CISO should be an excellent communicator. This will help address the second issue, which is how effectively the CISO can communicate with the board. Some suggestions are provided that serve to aid both effectiveness and efficiency. However, organizations need to embrace their concern about cybersecurity and build it into their selection criteria for board members. © 2016 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","CISO; CISO attributes; CISO job/role; Cybersecurity; Organization concerns",""

Therefore, we need a secure communication method to transmit messages via the Internet. Steganography is a technique that hides secret data into cover media by altering its most insignificant components, such that an unauthorized user will not be aware of the existence of the secret data. In recent years the development of artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic has started a new period in the whole science. The proposed scheme has taken into consideration the property that more information can be hidden into the edge areas rather than in the smooth areas. This scheme makes the use of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy edge detecting method as well as the modified LSB substitution method that causes the image quality and capacity to increase. The use of intuitionistic fuzzy sets not only improves the image quality, but it is also more accurate in detecting the edges and smooth areas. The proposed scheme is tested on different standard images with secret messages of various lengths.

Not only will automated vehicles incorporate more electronics and connectivity than ever before, but also, notably, they will transfer control and responsibility of monitoring the environment from a human driver to a robotic system. While prior work has assessed and provided security solutions for non-automated vehicles, there is much to understand regarding the security implications of AD. In this work, we begin to address this gap in understanding. This paper reports on a risk assessment framework for autonomous and cooperative AD. We aggregate the state of the art in AD research to define a reference architecture for automated vehicles, describing the new attack surfaces and data flow. Employing existing automotive threat models, we propose a novel application-based threat enumeration and analysis approach that is able to address different AD applications across all levels of automation. We demonstrate this framework with an example application assessment and summarize the results and security insights from analyses of other applications. The results of our risk assessment and future assessments with this framework will inform on the design of security solutions and secure architectures for production AD systems. © 2016 ACM.","Automated driving; Autonomous vehicles; Connected vehicles; Cooperative driving; Cybersecurity; Risk assessment; Threat modeling","Automation; Computer privacy; Embedded systems; Robotics; Vehicles; Automated driving; Autonomous Vehicles; Cooperative driving; Cyber security; Threat modeling; Risk assessment"

Some will not survive a cyber attack, and others will have their ability to continue trading seriously impaired. There is compelling evidence that, at present, SMEs do not seem to be implementing all the advisable security measures which could help them to resist such attacks. Many in the security industry believe that this is because SMEs do not take the threat seriously. This paper reports on a study to find out whether this is the case, or not. The primary finding is that most SMEs do care about the threat but that very few implement even a small subset of the available security precautions. One contributory factor seemed to be the uncertainty caused by the wealth of conflicting and confusing online advice offered by industry and official bodies. This seemed to be hindering rather than helping SMEs so that they did not know what actions to take to improve their resilience. The conclusion is a recommendation for actions to be taken to better inform SMEs and help them to secure their systems more effectively. © 2016 IEEE.","","Contributory factors; Cyber criminals; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; nocv2; Security industry; Security measure; Small and medium sized business; Crime"

Traditional insider threat detection methods often do not combine the behavior of people with business activities, making the threat detection rate to be improved. An insider threat detection system based on business process mining from two aspects was proposed, the implementation of insider threats and the impact of threats on system services. Firstly, the normal control flow model of business activities and the normal behavior profile of each operator were established by mining the training log. Then, the actual behavior of the operators was compared with the pre-established normal behavior contours during the operation of the system, which was supplemented by control flow anomaly detection and performance anomaly detection of business processes, in order to discover insider threats. A variety of anomalies were defined and the corresponding detection algorithms were given. Experiments were performed on the ProM platform. The results show the designed system is effective. © 2016, Editorial Board of Journal on Communications.

Social engineering through social media is a formidable enterprise concern due to the proclivity of social engineers targeting employees through these mediums to attack information assets residing within the organization. This research was motivated by a perceived gap in academic literature of organizational controls and guidance for employees concerning social engineering threats through social media adoption. The purpose of this paper is to propose a social media policy framework focusing on the practical reduction of social engineering risk through ICT security policy control. The framework's development involved an analysis of the primary social engineering through social media challenges alongside current information security standard recommendations.

Most of the proposals for their detection suggested recognition methods based on the comparison of use models of the protected environment. However recent studies have shown their vulnerability against adversarial attacks based on imitating the behavior of legitimate users. In order to contribute to their identification, this article introduces a novel detection method robust against evasion strategies based on mimicry. The proposal described two levels of information processing: analysis and verification. At the analysis stage, local alignment algorithms are implemented. In this way it is possible to score the similarity between action sequences performed by users, bearing in mind their regions of greatest resemblance. On the other hand, a novel validation scheme based on the statistical non-parametric U-test is implemented. Through this it is possible to refine the labeling of sequences to avoid making hasty decisions when their nature is not sufficiently clear. In order to strengthen their effectiveness against mimicry attacks, the analysis of the monitored sequences is performed in concurrency. This involves partitioning long sequences with two purposes: making subsequences of small intrusions more visible and analyzing new sequences when suspicious situations occur, such as the execution of never before seen commands or the discovery of potentially harmful activities. The proposal has been evaluated from the functional standard SEA and mimicry attacks. Promising experimental results have been shown, demonstrating great precision against conventional masqueraders (TPR=98.3%, FPR=0.77%) and a success rate of 80.2% when identifying mimicry attacks, hence outperforming the best contributions of bibliography. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Adversarial attacks; Identity theft; Information security; Intrusion detection; Masquerade attacks","Security of data; Adversarial attacks; Analysis and verifications; Detection methods; Evasion strategy; Identity theft; Masquerade attacks; Masquerade detection; Recognition methods; Intrusion detection"

The detection accuracy of the steganalyser depends on the selection of low-dimensional informative features. We investigate this problem as a three step process and propose a novel steganalyser with the following implications: a) Selection of the Curvelet sub-band image representation that offers better discrimination ability for detecting stego anomalies in images, than other conventional wavelet transforms. b) Exploiting the empirical moments of the transformation as effective steganalytic features c) Realizing the system using an efficient classifier, evolutionary-Support Vector Machine (SVM) model that provides promising classification rate. An extensive empirical evaluation on a database containing 5600 clean and stego images shows that the proposed scheme is a state-of-the-art steganalyser that outperforms other previous steganalytic methods. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Blind image steganalysis; Curvelet transformation; Evolutionary SVM model; Higher order statistics","Security of data; Steganography; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Blind image steganalysis; Curvelets; Discrimination ability; Empirical evaluations; Image representations; Pattern classification problems; Security infrastructure; SVM model; Higher order statistics"

This sharing includes threat, vulnerability and incident reporting data, among other data. For cyberattacks that include socio-technical vectors, such as phishing or watering hole attacks, this increased sharing could expose customer and employee personal data to increased privacy risk. In the US, privacy risk arises when the government voluntarily receives data from companies without meaningful consent from individuals, or without a lawful procedure that protects an individual's right to due process. In this paper, we describe a study to examine the trade-off between the need for potentially sensitive data, which we call incident data usage, and the perceived privacy risk of sharing that data with the government. The study is comprised of two parts: a data usage estimate built from a survey of 76 security professionals with mean eight years' experience; and a privacy risk estimate that measures privacy risk using an ordinal likelihood scale and nominal data types in factorial vignettes. The privacy risk estimate also factors in data purposes with different levels of societal benefit, including terrorism, imminent threat of death, economic harm, and loss of intellectual property. The results show which data types are high-usage, low-risk versus those that are low-usage, high-risk. We discuss the implications of these results and recommend future work to improve privacy when data must be shared despite the increased risk to privacy. © 2016 ACM.","Cybersecurity data sharing; Data usage; Personal privacy; Risk perception","Economic and social effects; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Data Sharing; Data usage; Government agencies; Imminent threats; Industrial sector; Personal privacy; Security professionals; Societal benefits; Data privacy"

A number of international standards, such as IEC 60870 and 61850, have emerged to enable remote and automated control over substations. However, owing to insufficient security consideration in their design and implementation, the resulting systems could be vulnerable to cyber attacks. As a result, the modernization of a large number of substations dramatically increases the scale of potential damage successful attacks can cause on power grids. To counter such a risk, one promising direction is to design and deploy an additional layer of defense at the substations. However, it remains a challenge to evaluate various substation cybersecurity solutions in a realistic environment. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of SoftGrid, a software-based smart grid testbed for evaluating the effectiveness, performance, and interoperability of various security solutions implemented to protect the remote control interface of substations.

The input image is transposed and converted into an HSI color space. The I-plane is divided into four sub-images of equal size, rotating each sub-image with a different angle using a secret key. The secret information is divided into four blocks, which are then encrypted using an MLE algorithm (MLEA).

As an important component of quantum secure communication, deterministic joint remote state preparation (DJRSP) could securely transmit a quantum state with 100 % success probability. In this paper, we study how the efficiency of DJRSP is affected when qubits involved in the protocol are subjected to noise or decoherence. Taking a GHZ-based DJRSP scheme as an example, we study all types of noise usually encountered in real-world implementations of quantum communication protocols, i.e., the bit-flip, phase-flip (phase-damping), depolarizing and amplitude-damping noise. Our study shows that the fidelity of the output state depends on the phase factor, the amplitude factor and the noise parameter in the bit-flip noise, while the fidelity only depends on the amplitude factor and the noise parameter in the other three types of noise. And the receiver will get different output states depending on the first preparer’s measurement result in the amplitude-damping noise. Our results will be helpful for improving quantum secure communication in real implementation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Deterministic joint remote state preparation; Fidelity; Quantum noise; Quantum secure communication","Damping; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum noise; Quantum optics; Secure communication; Security of data; Amplitude damping; Amplitude factors; Fidelity; Noise parameters; Phase damping; Quantum state; Real-world implementation; Remote state preparation; Quantum theory"

First will identify and classify the different types of attacks on cloud infrastructure. Next, based on the attacks we are going to suggest an appropriate approach that can be utilized to collect as much data possible to perform a detailed investing of the incidents or attacks. Furthermore, the proposed approach will be tested in a virtual environment in order to check its effectiveness. Finally, refinement will be performed based on the results obtained and will be bench marked against the existing computer forensic approaches. Thus, this study contributes to better provide many data sources that can be used by the investigators to conduct forensics investigation in the infrastructure layer of the cloud computing.

Steganography plays an effervescent role in the information security. It aims at concealing sensitive information within a host such that the information existence remains confidential. This paper implements image steganography with an objective of raising the security to a higher level while allowing maximum amount of data to be hidden inside. To achieve this, initially the cover image is transformed from spatial domain to frequency domain using 2-D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The wavelet transformed image allows embedding inside high frequency regions which maintains image quality by shielding the wavelet coefficients in the low frequency region. The secret image bits are compressed using Huffman encoding to increase the capacity of the system to uphold the data. Instead of sequential LSB embedding, RC4 algorithm is used that randomizes the order of embedding secret image message bits inside the cover image. This stochastic embedding of data increases the security as the unauthorized people won't be able to extract the secret image message. A robust steganographic is achieved by using this multi-tier architecture that enhances the security and capacity of the system while restoring the quality. © 2016 IEEE.","DWT; Encryption; Huffman encoding; LSB Technique; PSNR; RC4; Steganography","Client server computer systems; Cryptography; Discrete wavelet transforms; Encoding (symbols); Frequency domain analysis; Security of data; Steganography; Stochastic systems; 2-d discrete wavelet transforms; Huffman encoding; Low frequency regions; Lsb techniques; Multi tier architecture; PSNR; Sensitive informations; Wavelet transformed images; Wavelet transforms"

As the Snowden case shows, these permissions can be exploited to steal valuable personal, classified, or commercial data. In this work we propose a strategy that increases the organizational information security by constraining IT personnel's view of the system and monitoring their actions. To this end, we introduce the abstraction of perforated containers - while regular Linux containers are too restrictive to be used by system administrators, by ""punching holes"" in them, we strike a balance between information security and required administrative needs. Our system predicts which system resources should be accessible for handling each IT issue, creates a perforated container with the corresponding isolation, and deploys it in the corresponding machines as needed for fixing the problem. Under this approach, the system administrator retains his superuser privileges, while he can only operate within the container limits. We further provide means for the administrator to bypass the isolation, and perform operations beyond her boundaries. However, such operations are monitored and logged for later analysis and anomaly detection.

This is because quantum teleportation has the ability to attain a timely secret information delivery and offers unconditional security. And as such, the field of quantum teleportation has become a hot research topic in recent years. However, noise has serious effect on the safety of quantum teleportation within the aspects of information fidelity, channel capacity and information transfer. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to address these problems of quantum teleportation. Firstly, in order to resist collective noise, we construct a decoherence-free subspace under different noise scenarios to establish a two-dimensional fidelity quantum teleportation models. And also create quantum teleportation of multiple degree of freedom, and these models ensure the accuracy and availability of the exchange of information and in multiple degree of freedom. Secondly, for easy preparation, measurement and implementation, we use super dense coding features to build an entangled quantum secret exchange channel. To improve the channel utilization and capacity, an efficient super dense coding method based on ultra-entanglement exchange is used. Thirdly, continuous variables of the controlled quantum key distribution were designed for quantum teleportation; in addition, we perform Bell-basis measurement under the collective noise and also prepare the storage technology of quantum states to achieve one-bit key by three-photon encoding to improve its security and efficiency. We use these two methods because they conceal information, resist a third party attack and can detect eavesdropping. Our proposed methods, according to the security analysis, are able to solve the problems associated with the quantum teleportation under various noise environments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Collective noise; Immune model; Multiple degree of freedom; Quantum key distribution; Quantum teleportation; Super dense coding","Codes (symbols); Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Security of data; Security systems; Collective noise; Dense coding; Immune models; Multiple-degree-of-freedom; Quantum teleportation; Quantum cryptography"

To secure the information and capture the criminal activities, biometric system especially the latent fingerprints are very factual. In law enforcement agencies, latent fingerprint recognition plays a major role to identify and convict criminals. But the fingerprint impressions available during the crime scene are of poor quality and lesser minutiae information with great level of overlapping patterns. Although significant algorithms and techniques have been achieved for the automated fingerprint recognition, but it is still a challenging task due to presence of noise level and poor image quality. Fingerprint enhancement is the initial step of fingerprint recognition system. To recognize any fingerprints, it is necessary to enhance the quality of latent impression of fingerprints to get the minutiae information. The execution of any recognition technique highly dependent on quality of the fingerprints retrieved. Lesser the number of minutiae and greater the value of noise makes it difficult to recognize the latent fingerprints impressions with their mated full prints that are stored in law enforcement databases. In this paper, we have discussed various exiting latent fingerprint enhancement and recognition methods.

In encryption phase, chaotic sequence is applied to encrypt the original image. Then the least significant bits (LSBs) of pixels in encrypted image are losslessly compressed to leave place for secret data. With auxiliary bit stream, the lossless compression is realized by the Hamming distance calculation between the LSB stream and auxiliary stream. At receiving terminal, the operation is flexible, that is, it meets the requirement of separation. With the decryption key, a receiver can get access to the marked decrypted image which is similar to the original one. With data-hiding key, the receiver can successfully extract secret data from the marked encrypted image. With both keys, the receiver can get secret data and the exactly original image.

Subsequently, a conceptual model was proposed taking into mentioned factors for HIS security effectiveness. Then, this quantitative study used the structural equation modeling to examine the proposed model based on survey data collected from a sample of 263 HIS users from eight hospitals in Iran.

These devices can protect the network system from all aspects, but also bring new problems for information security administration. Massive alert data from different devices are increasingly generated and some real alerts are buried with the overwhelming alerts, which are mixed with a large amount of repetitive and false alerts. In this paper, we propose a multi-source alert data understanding scheme based on rough set theory for security semantic discovery. Firstly, we classify the alert data according to the data features to merge the multi-source alerts. Then, we calculate the weight for each classification of alerts by applying the rough set theory to historical data. Then we perform data aggregation by alert similarity computation to reduce repetitive alerts from different sources. Also, we introduce reliability metrics to measure the credibility of different alerts for further correlation and semantic analysis according to the network background information. We perform experiments on the collected data set in the real network system and DARPR 2000 data set. Experimental results show that our proposed method could reduce more than 80% repetitive alerts in the data sets. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Feature weight; Multi-source; Rough set theory; Security semantic; Understanding","Computation theory; Computer system firewalls; Intrusion detection; Network security; Reliability analysis; Security of data; Semantics; Set theory; Background information; Feature weight; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-Sources; Real network systems; Security administration; Similarity computation; Understanding; alert similarity computation; Article; classification; computer network; controlled study; correlation analysis; data aggregation; data analysis; information processing; priority journal; reliability; rough set; security semantic; statistical analysis; Rough set theory"

Starting with the hypothesis that an attacker's effort increases as the common set of executable code snippets (return-oriented programming (ROP) gadgets) decreases across application variants, we explore how different diversification techniques affect the set of ROP gadgets that is available to an attacker. We show that a small population of diversified variants is sufficient to eliminate 90-99% of ROP gadgets across a collection of real-world applications. Finally, we observe that the number of remaining gadgets may still be sufficient for an attacker to mount an effective attack regardless of the presence of software diversity. © 2016 ACM.","Code reuse attacks; Compiler transformations; Evaluation; Return-oriented programming (ROP); Software diversity","Computer software reusability; Code reuse; Compiler transformations; Evaluation; Return-oriented programming; Software diversity; Program compilers"

In the method, the input and output data in every iteration of 6th-order CNN were controlled to improved the performance of the random number affected by chaos degradation. Then the data were XORed with a variable parameter and the random sequences generated by a Logistic map, by which the repeat of generated sequences was avoided, and the period of output sequences and the key space were expended. Besides, the new method was easy to be realized in the software and could generate 64 bit random numbers every time, thus has a high generating efficiency. Test results show that the generated random numbers can pass the statistical test suite NIST SP800-22 completely and thus has good randomness.

However, a few successful cases of enterprise application systems have been constructed and adopted by companies. To understand the factors that affect the adoption by a company of cloud Customer Relationship Management (CRM), which is an enterprise application system, this study used a Technology Organization Environment Framework (TOE) as a theoretical framework, reviewed related literature on the relevant factors affecting the adoption of a cloud service, and then constructed a three-level hierarchical table of the factors. A pairwise comparison questionnaire was then designed and issued to top managers of firms in the machinery industry in Taiwan that have adopted cloud CRM. A fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) was then used to calculate the weights of the factors, based on the returned questionnaires. The results show that enterprises in the machinery industry gave priority to the factor, ‘support of senior managers’, followed by the factors ‘organizational policies’ and ‘system information security’. Some implications of the findings are discussed, which can serve as a guide for the successful adoption of cloud CRM in machinery industry if firms allocate their resources appropriately to these important factors.

So, one might be authorized to use a certain command on one object, while being forbidden to use the same command on another object.

In August of 1992, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) developed the Department of Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP); an assessment process for all Department of Defense (DoD) information systems. The accreditation and requirements process was service-specific and system-centric. In July 2006, the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) was distributed. DIACAP implemented enterprise-wide Information Assurance (IA) through a standardized set of IA controls with continuous monitoring and annual reviews of the system's security posture. The current process, implemented in May 2014, is the Risk Management Framework (RMF). RMF is a more dynamic and integrated process than its predecessors. Instead of DoD defined security controls, RMF uses the Committee on National Security Systems Instructions (CNSSI) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications for its risk assessment guidelines and security control references respectively. Under RMF, all Information Technology (IT) is placed into four broad categories. These categories are Information Systems (IS), Platform IT (PIT), IT services and IT products. Fundamentally, all DoD IT assets must be categorized, security controls tailored, and implemented for the specific asset. Operational Test Program Sets (OTPS) mainly fall into the category of PIT. However, there may be circumstances where OTPSs fall into the category of an IS or any number of ambiguous areas. Since only generic high-level guidance is provided to evaluate PIT, guidelines for evaluating PIT OTPSs will be summarized. Also, since not all OTPSs are PIT and it may not be immediately clear which system category an OTPS falls, guidelines will be created to define these systems for proper evaluation. For the majority of OTPSs during the acquisition lifecycle; risk categorization, control selection, and assessment will occur. Case studies of OTPSs will be analyzed and discussed; OTPS PIT, OTPS IS, and ambiguous examples. In each of these cases, the question of task dependence versus the definition of what makes a particular OTPS a PIT or IS will be explored. © 2016 IEEE.","cybersecurity; NAVAIR; OTPS; risk; RMF","Accreditation; Information systems; Mergers and acquisitions; National security; Risk management; Risks; Software testing; Cyber security; Defense information systems agencies; Development community; Information assurance; National Institute of Standards and Technology; NAVAIR; OTPS; Risk management framework; Risk assessment"

Hence, data mining techniques are becoming an essential tool for real-world cyber security applications. For example, a report from Gartner [4] claims that ""Information security is becoming a big data analytics problem, where massive amounts of data will be correlated, analyzed and mined for meaningful patterns"". Of course, data mining/analytics is a means to an end where the ultimate goal is to provide cyber security analysts with prioritized actionable insights derived from big data. This raises the question, can we directly apply existing techniques to cyber security applications? One of the most important differences between data mining for cyber security and many other data mining applications is the existence of malicious adversaries that continuously adapt their behavior to hide their actions and to make the data mining models ineffective. Unfortunately, traditional data mining techniques are insufficient to handle such adversarial problems directly. The adversaries adapt to the data miner's reactions, and data mining algorithms constructed based on a training dataset degrades quickly. To address these concerns, over the last couple of years new and novel data mining techniques which is more resilient to such adversarial behavior are being developed in machine learning and data mining community. We believe that lessons learned as a part of this research direction would be beneficial for cyber security researchers who are increasingly applying machine learning and data mining techniques in practice. To give an overview of recent developments in adversarial data mining, in this three hour long tutorial, we introduce the foundations, the techniques, and the applications of adversarial data mining to cyber security applications. We first introduce various approaches proposed in the past to defend against active adversaries, such as a minimax approach to minimize the worst case error through a zero-sum game. We then discuss a game theoretic framework to model the sequential actions of the adversary and the data miner, while both parties try to maximize their utilities. We also introduce a modified support vector machine method and a relevance vector machine method to defend against active adversaries. Intrusion detection and malware detection are two important application areas for adversarial data mining models that will be discussed in details during the tutorial. Finally, we discuss some practical guidelines on how to use adversarial data mining ideas in generic cyber security applications and how to leverage existing big data management tools for building data mining algorithms for cyber security. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Adversarial data mining; Big data analytics for cyber security","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Game theory; Information management; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Malware; Miners; Security of data; Teaching; Cyber security; Data management tools; Data mining algorithm; Data mining applications; Data mining community; Malicious adversaries; Practical guidelines; Relevance Vector Machine; Data mining"

These vulnerabilities are mission-critical: they include launch systems, communications, telemetry, tracking and command, and mission completion. They and other aspects of satellite communications depend heavily on secure and resilient cyber capabilities for all stages of the satellite's lifespan. Because of the inherently global nature of both satellite and cyberspace activities, these capabilities rely significantly on international cooperation for setting a baseline of agreed legal norms that protect satellites and satellite communications. This critical cooperation is relevant during all mission phases, from planning to final wrap-up. Under optimal circumstances, the norms and standards protecting satellites and satellite transmissions are developed and enforced by those nation-state actors that are committed to system operability and overall mission sustainability for those satellites launched under their aegis and responsibility. However, when breaches of international law do occur in the form of hostile cyber events that cause damage to satellite communications, a range of measures should be available to the victim state, provided by the appropriate legal regime or regimes. This article proposes that a comprehensive and integrative multi-stakeholder review be undertaken in the near future of the measures available under international law for responding to hostile acts directed at satellite systems and communications, in a manner that takes into account both existing regimes of international law reviewed herein, as well as considerations of cybersecurity. These measures will depend upon the characterization of hostile interference with satellite transmissions in accordance with a proposed typology of hostile events. At present, four key normative international law regimes influence the types of measures that may be undertaken by states: the UN Charter's collective security regime; space law (governing the launching of objects and their space activities, including liability for damages); global telecommunications law (governing data transmissions and protection of infrastructures); and the substantive law relating to transborder freedom of information. Moreover, the nascent normative framework that will eventually apply to state and non-state activities in cyberspace will also be relevant to satellite communications, although it has been largely excluded from analyses and studies. In summary, this article proposes a typology of hostile events, both kinetic and cyber-enabled, that are liable to disrupt satellite communications; and it reviews the four key relevant legal regimes and notes the challenges of nascent cybersecurity law on the international plane. The article concludes by advocating for the establishment of a framework for effective elucidation of appropriate legal remedies at the international level in responding to kinetic, virtual and hybrid threats and hostile disruptions to satellite communications. © 2016 IAA.","","Communication satellites; Computers; International cooperation; International law; Satellite communication systems; Space flight; Sustainable development; Freedom of informations; Global telecommunication; Mission completion; Multi-stakeholder; Satellite communications; Satellite transmission; Space activities; Telemetry , tracking and commands; Satellites"

Though the concept is promising, implementations have not been widely adopted. The field has been actively researched for over ten years, and has only produced a small amount of extensively adopted defenses, most notably, address space layout randomization (ASLR). This is despite the fact that there currently exist a variety of moving target implementations and proofs-of-concept. We suspect that this results from the moving target controls breaking critical system dependencies from the perspectives of users and administrators, as well as making things more difficult for attackers. As a result, the impact of the controls on overall system security is not sufficient to overcome the inconvenience imposed on legitimate system users. In this paper, we analyze a successful MTD approach. We study the control's dependency graphs, showing how we use graph theoretic and network properties to predict the effectiveness of the selected control. © 2016 ACM.","Cybersecurity; Dynamic defense; Moving target defense","Graph theory; Address space layout randomizations; Critical systems; Cyber security; Dependency graphs; Graph-theoretic; Legitimate systems; Moving target defense; Network properties; Program processors"

With these changes, the threat has increased of advanced attacks that were previously too difficult to carry out, not just in the military and diplomatic fields but also for general-use commercial manufactured goods. This special session focuses on the problem of reduced security concerning electromagnetic waves (electromagnetic information security), which has made attack detection particularly difficult at the physical level.

As standardization behind network-assisted D2D technology takes shape, it becomes clear that security of direct connectivity is one of the key concerns on the way to its ultimate user adoption. This is especially true when a personal user cluster (that is, a smartphone and associated wearable devices) does not have a reliable connection to the cellular infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that embraces security of geographically proximate user clusters. More specifically, we employ game-theoretic mechanisms for appropriate user clustering taking into account both spatial and social notions of proximity. Further, our information security procedures implemented on top of this clustering scheme enable continuous support for secure direct communication even in case of unreliable/unavailable cellular connectivity. Explicitly incorporating the effects of user mobility, we numerically evaluate the proposed framework by confirming that it has the potential to substantially improve the resulting system-wide performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering; D2D; Performance evaluation; Security; Social proximity","Security of data; Cellular connectivity; Cellular infrastructure; Clustering; Deviceto-device (D2D) communication; Performance evaluation; Secure direct communication; Security; Social proximity; Game theory"

Initially, user's confidential details are encrypted using the more secure Multi curve Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique. Next, the encrypted cipher is embedded into the H.264 Video using a novel proposed Optimized Modified Matrix Encoding (OMME) steganography technique to embed the secret data. While embedding the encrypted confidential details into the video, pixels from the frames can be selected using an optimization algorithm called Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) in order to reduce distortion of stego video. Finally, the user's secret data embedded in the H.264 Video is extracted and it is de-ciphered.

Risks may arise from factors such as printer manufacturers not having the requisite levels of security awareness, and not fully understanding the need for security measures to protect intellectual property, and other sensitive data that are stored, accessed, and transmitted from such devices. This paper examines the security features of two different models of MakerBot Industries' consumer-oriented 3D printers and proposes an attack technique that is able to, not only, exfiltrate sensitive data, but also allow for remote manipulation of these devices. The attack steps are discretely modeled using a threat model to enable formal representation of the attack. Specifically, we found that the printers stored the previously printed and currently printing objects on an unauthenticated web server. We also ascertain that the transport layer security implementation on these devices was flawed, which severely affected the security of these devices and allowed for remote exploitation. Countermeasures to the attack that are implementable by both the manufacturer and the user of the printer are presented. © 2016 IEEE.","3D printing vulnerabilities; data exfiltration; remote attack; threat model","Manufacture; Printing; Printing machinery; Printing presses; Risk assessment; 3-D printing; Data exfiltration; Formal representations; Printer manufacturers; Remote attacks; Remote manipulation; Threat modeling; Transport layer security; 3D printers"

This has led to the proliferation of ubiquitous connectivity to critical infrastructures (electrical grid, utility networks, finance, etc.) that are used to deliver advanced information services to homes, businesses, and government. On the other hand, such smart systems are more complex, dynamic, heterogeneous, and have many vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyberattacks. Protecting and securing the resources and services of smart cities become critically important due to the disruptive or even potentially life-threatening nature of a failure or attack on smart cities' infrastructures. In this paper we present a resilient architecture that protects smart cities' communications, controls, and computations based on autonomic computing and Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques.

This paper presents a simple and efficient user verification system by modeling mouse-interaction behavior, which is accurate and competent for future deployment. For each mouse-operation sample, holistic attributes of mouse trajectories are first analyzed using a power transformation method, to derive a schematic representation of behavior eigenspace. Then, a propagation-based segmentation method is developed to model the detailed dynamic process of mouse movements by performing adaptive behavior segmentation and then characterizing each obtained segment using fine-grained procedural motion metrics. Both schematic and procedural cues from mouse-interaction behaviors may be used independently for verification, being fused at the decision level using combination rules. Analyses are conducted using data from 106 subjects with 21 200 mouse-operation samples. The verification system achieves a 1.96% false-rejection rate and a 1.18% false-acceptance rate with a short verification time (about 6 s) and lightweight system overload. Additional experiments on the effect of sample length and subject pool further examine the applicability of our verification system. We also compare the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art approaches for the data collected. Our findings suggest that mouse-interaction behaviors can enhance traditional authentication systems. © 2016 IEEE.","Human-computer interaction; mouse-interaction behavior; one-class learning; user verification system","Face recognition; Mammals; Security of data; Additional experiments; Authentication systems; False acceptance rate; False rejection rate; Schematic representations; State-of-the-art approach; Transformation methods; Verification systems; Behavioral research"

Visual cryptography and secret sharing provide information security without using complex mathematically operators. Thus, visual cryptography and secret sharing are widely used. In this paper, letter based secret image sharing (LSIS) is used for protecting image contents. For this purpose, secret sharing and data hiding algorithms are used together in this LSIS method. The LSIS method consists of two parts. These are generating of meaningful secret sharing and data hiding. Secret sharing and visual cryptography methods commonly generate noise-like images. The noise-like images have attracted the attention of the attackers and several attacks have been developed to break these encrypted images. To prevent these attacks, meaningful secret shares are generated and these secret shares are embedded into cover image. In this paper, a novel secret image sharing method based on Arabic letters is suggested. The proposed method uses Arabic letters for generating meaningful secret shares and data hiding functions are used for camouflage. RGB images are used for cover images. In proposed method, secret shares are embedded into R, G and B channels respectively. Thus, cheatings occurring in visual cryptography are prevented. A secret image sharing method, which is independent morphological features of letters, is obtained by using the proposed method. In this proposed secret image sharing, Arabic letters are used because of Arabic is one of the richest languages in the world. In the data hiding method, 2LSBs data hiding function is used. © 2016, University of Kuwait.

Besides computing/communications/networking based cyber-Attacks, CPS are vulnerable to process-Aware attacks that aim to disrupt the proper functioning or hamper performance, efficiency, stability, and safety of the physical systems/processes of the CPS. By modifying the information flow or the computational behavior of the system, process-Aware attacks can disrupt the functioning the CPS to thereby hamper the performance or stability of the overall system or its components. Increasing network connectivity of the computational nodes of a CPS facilitates the maintenance and on-demand reprogrammability of computational nodes, greatly reducing the operator workload.

As the cyber environment has expanded and become more complex, so have the nature of adversaries and styles of attacks. Today, cyber incidents are an expected part of life. As a result, cybersecurity research emerged to address adversarial attacks interfering with or preventing normal cyber activities. Historical response to cybersecurity attacks is heavily skewed to tactical responses with an emphasis on rapid recovery. While threat mitigation is important and can be time critical, a knowledge gap exists with respect to developing the science of cybersecurity. Such a science will enable the development and testing of theories that lead to understanding the broad sweep of cyber threats and the ability to assess trade-offs in sustaining network missions while mitigating attacks. The Asymmetric Resilient Cybersecurity Initiative at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is a multi-year, multi-million dollar investment to develop approaches for shifting the advantage to the defender and sustaining the operability of systems under attack. The initiative established a Science Council to focus attention on the research process for cybersecurity. The Council shares science practices, critiques research plans, and AIDS in documenting and reporting reproducible research results. The Council members represent ecology, economics, statistics, physics, computational chemistry, microbiology and genetics, and geochemistry.

In the context of this paper the concept of the ""organization"" has to be extended to comprise a smart city or a compound structure of smart cities interrelated at different administrative, legislative, geographical and technical levels. The management of an asset portfolio is generically introduced by ISO 55000. Management of fixed assets is a process that seeks to track assets for the purpose of financial accounting, theft prevention, preventive maintenance etc. Software asset management (SAM), as covered by ISO/IEC 19770-5, addresses processes and technology for managing software and related IT assets. These digital assets are key enablers for most activities in a world of smart cities. The fact that systematic asset management is currently enforced only in a few, heavily regulated business domains indicates that, at a smart city level, this will be a daunting challenge. The focus of this paper is on the manual and automatic asset identification, annotation and tracking as well as on the assignment of graded application security controls (ASCs) that can benefit from a comprehensive and formalized asset management. This includes the availability and integrity of fixed and mobile information technology (IT) assets connected to wired and wireless networks and the reliability and integrity of software assets installed on servers and cloud environments. Asset identification is a precondition for the safe application of security patches and for conducting risk assessments with consideration of version and patch-level specific dependencies between software components. Rigorous and pervasive asset management provides value beyond security, for example with regard to a more efficient use of software license pools or other temporarily assigned resources (like exchangeable battery packs) or resources needed on demand (like smart healthcare robots). Unfortunately, new concerns are also raised, as semi-formal asset descriptions, enhanced details on links between assets and the simplified tracking of assets may be misused for sophisticated attacks targeting combinations of version specific vulnerabilities. For selected ongoing smart city related projects this paper addresses the stringent need of adding a semi-formal asset management, the immediate benefits and the expected progressive benefits derived e.g. from model-based guidance that relies on the asset specific intelligence. © 2016 IEEE.","Application security controls; Asset management tools; Asset portfolio; Automatic asset identification; Smart cities","Asset management; Preventive maintenance; Risk assessment; Software reliability; Application security; Asset identification; Asset management tool; Asset portfolio; Smart cities; Application programs"

An aspect yet to receive much attention in this respect is that of secure software development, or 'SWSec' - another area that has seen a surge of research since 2000. SWSec provides paradigms, practices and procedures that offer some promise to address current security problems, yet those solutions face financial and technical barriers that necessitate a more thorough approach to planning and execution. Meanwhile, information security economics has developed theory and practice to support a particular world-view; however, it has yet to account for the investments, constructs and benefits of SWSec. As the frequency and severity of computer misuse has increased, both areas have struggled to impart a new mindset for addressing the inherent issues that arise in a diverse, connected and functionality-driven landscape. This paper presents a call for the establishment of an economics of secure software development. We present the primary challenges facing practice, citing relevant literature from both communities to illustrate where commonalities lie - and where further work is needed. Those challenges are decomposed into a research agenda, deriving from the application of principles in both themes a lack of models, representation and analysis in practice.

As a building block of CrySoCs, True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) exploit analog noise sources in electronic devices to generate confidential keys, initialization vectors, challenges, nonces, and random masks in cryptographic protocols. TRNGs aimed at cryptographic applications must fulfill the security requirements defined in the German Federal Bureau for Information Security's (BSI) recommendations AIS-20/31, which has become a de facto standard in Europe. Many TRNG cores have already been published, only a few of which are suitable for FPGAs and even fewer comply with AIS-20/31. Here we present the results of the implementation of AIS-20/31 compliant TRNG cores in three FPGA families: Xilinx Spartan 6, Altera Cyclone V and Microsemi SmartFusion 2. In addition to common design parameters like area, bit rate and power/energy consumption, we compare and discuss the feasibility of generator cores in different FPGAs and the statistical quality of their output.

The attraction points for these communities are security issues of cloud storage. The user of cloud feels insecure about the data secrecy in cloud, so in order to minimize the unfaithfulness between the user and cloud service provider, a hardback solution for security of cloud storage is initiated. To overcome from these security aspects (Privacy, Authentication and Integrity) CSP impose different security mechanism. In this paper, we have proposed a new framework to protect Confidentiality and Integrity of data stored in cloud. In this framework, we use AES, SHA-1, and Station-to-Station Key Agreement protocol.

Smart buildings accept excess of energy during periods when renewable energy generation is cheap and overflowing. Then, the electric energy is kept for future use and returned to the smart grid when needed. Many advantages exist for smart cities which are focused on the incorporation of smart buildings. The control of smart buildings is supported by dramatically increased embedded systems. This approach is becoming cost-effective and the systems will be almost maintenance-free, involving some or no individuals. Users will also have the ability to simply update settings using their smartphones and other smart devices. However, even with above mentioned advantages, some disadvantages, including cybersecurity risk, are present and therefore, protective measures for a smart world are needed. The consequences of not incorporating cybersecurity and forensic readiness in a smart world could have serious impact if cyber-attack was successfully launched. In addition, a broad Knowledge Management (KM) is needed to obtain increasingly better understanding and handling of cybersecurity issues of smart sensors and other extensively configurable devices. This paper addresses the importance of forensic readiness, digital evidence preservation and interpretation, and knowledge management in a smart world.

How to effectively prevent the disclosure of sensitive information has become a major issue in enabling public access to the published dataset that contain personal information. As a newly developed notion of privacy preserving, differential privacy can provide strong security protection due to its greatest advantage of not making any specific assumptions on the attacker's background, and has been extensively studied. The existing approaches of differential privacy cannot fully and effectively solve the problem of releasing high-dimensional data. Although the PrivBayes can transform high-dimensional data to low-dimensional one, but cannot prevent attributes disclosure on certain conditions, and also has some limitations and shortcomings. In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a new and powerful improved algorithm for data publishing called weighted PrivBayes.

While these IT technologies offer high flexibility, interoperability, and convenient administration of ICSs, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment is a key foundational component of security protection. However, due to the characteristics of ICSs, the risk assessment for IT systems is not completely applicable for ICSs. In this paper, through the consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a targeted multilevel Bayesian network containing attack, function, and incident models is proposed. Following this proposal, a novel multimodel-based hazardous incident prediction approach is designed. On this basis, a dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment approach, which has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks, is also devised. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the risk assessment, which may be reduced by the redundant accumulation of overlaps amongst different consequences, a unified consequence quantification method is presented. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation of a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results can clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to dynamically calculate the cybersecurity risk of ICSs in a timely manner. Additionally, the result of a different comparative simulation shows that our approach has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks. © 2015 IEEE.","Bayesian network; cybersecurity; incident prediction; industrial control system (ICS); multiple models; risk assessment","Bayesian networks; Control systems; Forecasting; Intelligent control; MATLAB; Assessment approaches; Comparative simulation; Cyber security; High flexibility; Industrial control systems; Quantification methods; Security protection; Unknown attacks; Risk assessment"

As a result, uncertainty quantification of attacker payoff functions within stochastic cybersecurity games is a critical area of research interest. This study focuses on operationalizing a probabilistic framework for quantifying attacker payoffs, within a notional case study, through: (1) representation of uncertain attacker and system-related modeling variables as probability distributions and mathematical intervals, and (2) exploration of uncertainty propagation techniques including two-phase Monte Carlo sampling and probability bounds analysis.

Recent events have shown that vulnerabilities in this infrastructure may be exploited to manipulate the data being exchanged. Such a scenario could cause the associated control applications to mis-operate, potentially causing system-wide instabilities. There is a growing emphasis on looking beyond traditional cybersecurity solutions to mitigate such threats. In this paper we perform a testbed-based validation of one such solution - Attack Resilient Control (ARC) - on Iowa State University's PowerCyber testbed. ARC is a cyber-physical security solution that combines domain-specific anomaly detection and model-based mitigation to detect stealthy attacks on Automatic Generation Control (AGC). In this paper, we first describe the implementation architecture of the experiment on the testbed. Next, we demonstrate the capability of stealthy attack templates to cause forced under-frequency load shedding in a 3-area test system. We then validate the performance of ARC by measuring its ability to detect and mitigate these attacks. Our results reveal that ARC is efficient in detecting stealthy attacks and enables AGC to maintain system operating frequency close to its nominal value during an attack. Our studies also highlight the importance of testbed-based experimentation for evaluating the performance of cyber-physical security and control applications. © 2016 IEEE.","","Electric load shedding; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Network security; Testbeds; Automatic generation control; Control applications; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Cyber-Physical securities; Implementation architecture; Iowa State University; Underfrequency load-shedding; Wide-area monitoring and controls; Electric power system control"

Although it can be difficult to maintain flow when recruiting younger students who lack many fundamentals this approach has led to a deeper and more robust educational environment for all participants. These changes have led to a need for structure, a way in which the students and the faculty can measure progress and continual learning. We have formed a new ranking system for the Red Team with the goal of providing students with a method of self-evaluating their progress in between formal pass-offs with the team advisor. The structure allows students to take initiative in their learning and ranking process rather than waiting on the instruction from professors or more experienced students.

A blind forensic method to detect spliced image based on a shadow model is proposed. The method is based on the fact that a natural shadow contains certain features absent in a fake shadow. A shadow model suitable for image forensics is established. Shadows are extracted and located by using an algorithm of image region dilation. A robust shadow scale factor is then obtained by using an energy minimization method, and interfering points removed. Thus, fake shadows can be determined from abnormal values of the shadow scale factor.

OPM fell victim to not only one, but two cybersecurity attacks on its secure information systems. Law enforcement officials conducted an investigation and arrested a group of Chinese hackers responsible for the theft of 21.5 million federal employee's background information and 5.6 million fingerprints. The names of federal employees, their addresses, social security numbers, and other personal records were stolen. By acquiring information about current and past federal employees, these criminals were now in possession of invaluable information to conduct economic espionage. As media outlets picked up on the story of this massive data breach, the question on people's minds was, if the federal government cannot protect people's information, then who can? © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","cyber security; data breach; Office of Personnel Management (OPM); risk",""

To give an example, steganography techniques are used to communicate in a secret and invisible way. Digital color images have become a good medium for digital steganography because of their easy manipulation as carriers via Internet, e-mails, or used on websites. The main goal of steganalysis is to detect the presence of hidden messages in a digital media. The proposed method is a further extension of the authors' previous work: steganalysis based on color feature correlation and machine learning classification. Fusing features with those obtained from color-rich models allows increasing the detectability of hidden messages in the color images. Our new proposition uses two types of features, computed between color image channels. The first type of feature reflects local Euclidean transformations, and the second one reflects mirror transformations. These geometric measures are obtained by the sine and cosine of gradient angles between all the color channels. Features are extracted from co-occurrence correlation matrices of measures. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework on three steganography algorithms designed to hide messages in images represented in the spatial domain: S-UNIWARD, WOW, and Synch-HILL. For each algorithm, we applied a range of different payload sizes. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the comparison with the previous authors work and the spatial color-rich model and color filter array-aware features for steganalysis.

We present probabilistic analysis to determine the optimal k and to estimate the expected running time for the parallel combination. Our analysis is conducted in two stages. First, we roughly narrow the range of optimal k by using the expected values for the random variables used in the analysis. Second, we precisely determine the optimal k by using the exact probability distribution of the random variables. Our experiments show that the optimal k and the expected running time determined by our analysis are precise and accurate.

To improve recognition accuracy of JPEG stego-image, we establish a model of scatter matrix eigenspectrum, and purpose a new method to transfer training features of cover and stego images. The eigenspectrum is first modeled by its distribution and divided into three non-overlapping partitions: areas in which the eigenvalue drops rapidly, areas with stable eigenvalues, and areas of zero eigenvalue. The eigenvector is whitened and regularized in the three partitions with adaptive regularization. The result of these steps is a transfer matrix that transfers the input features. The features are now processed and extracted by picking the first t eigenvectors. The processed feature data are then trained with a Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) ensemble classifier. The result shows that recognition accuracy of JPEG stegoimages with the FLD ensemble is improved after the JPEG stego-image features are sorted, regularized and extracted. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of Applied Sciences.

In order to provide better security and less computational time lightweight cryptographic scheme called signcryption has introduced. Signcryption is a logical combination of encryption and signature. Cryptographically secure random numbers are used as private key in encryption segment and as key in generating signature of SHA-1 segment. Generally the random numbers passing the NIST Test suite fails to satisfy cryptographically secure requirements. An approach called twining technique along with AES in counter mode is used to generate cryptographically random numbers from the seed values of sensors. Twining technique is a novel method to minimize co linearity that occurs while extracting seed from multiple sensors housed in same environment. One of the most recent researches in the area of public key cryptography is HyperElliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) because HECC uses smaller key size and less computational time.

Many studies investigated the security vulnerabilities and privacy issues of social networking sites and made recommendations on how to mitigate security risks. Users are an integral part of any security mix. In this paper, we explore the relationship between users' security perceptions and their actual behavior on social networking sites. Protection motivation theory (PMT), initially was developed to study fear appeals, and has been widely used to examine people's behavior in information security domains. We propose that PMT theory can also be adapted to explain and predict social media users' behaviors that have security implications.

Various layers of hierarchical control and communication systems are coordinated, both spatially and temporally to achieve gird reliability. As new communication network based control system technologies are being deployed, the interconnected nature of these systems is becoming more complex. Deployment of smart grid concepts promises effective integration of renewable resources, especially if combined with energy storage. However, without a philosophical focus on resilience, a smart grid will potentially lead to higher magnitude and/or duration of disruptive events. The effectiveness of a resilient infrastructure depends upon its ability to anticipate, absorb, adapt to, and/or rapidly recover from a potentially catastrophic event. Future system operations can be enhanced with a resilient philosophy through architecting the complexity with state awareness metrics that recognize changing system conditions and provide for an agile and adaptive response. The starting point for metrics lies in first understanding the attributes of performance that will be qualified. In this paper, we will overview those attributes and describe how they will be characterized by designing a distributed agent that can be applied to the power grid. © 2016 IEEE.","Communication System security; Information security; Power System Stability; Power transmission; Resilience","Complex networks; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Hierarchical systems; Philosophical aspects; Security of data; Smart power grids; System stability; Telecommunication networks; Uncertainty analysis; Catastrophic event; Communication system security; Distributed agents; Hierarchical control; Interdependent systems; Network based control system; Power system stability; Resilience; Electric power system protection"

It is a potential technique in signal processing and data management of the encrypted domain fields. This paper proposes a novel scheme of multiple bits reversible data hiding in encrypted domain based on R-LWE (ring-learning with errors). Multi-band data can be embedded by quantifying the encrypted domain and recoding in the redundancy of cipher text without degrading the hardness of R-LWE algorithm; the embedding recoding method is based on the data distribution during encryption, which maintains the robustness of R-LWE algorithm; By dividing the integer domain into the sub-regions and introducing different quantifying rules, the processes of extraction and decryption can be separated. By deducing the error probability of the scheme, parameters in the scheme which is directly related to the correctness of the scheme is mainly discussed, and reasonable ranges of the parameters are obtained by experiments. When analyzing the security, the probability distribution function of the embedded cipher text is deduced and the statistic features of cipher data are analyzed, which both prove the embedded data isn't detective. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed scheme can not only keep fully reversibility of vehicle recovering and lossless extraction of secret message, but realize that one bit original data can load multiple-bit additional data in encrypted domain, achieving an embedding capacity of 0.2353 bit per every bit of the encrypted data. © 2016, Science Press.

Social media is all about sharing, but this in itself makes it an easy target for attackers to gain usable information. Social media is all about sharing, and this means that many organisations view it as a threat to their information security.

While the standardization efforts are far from their final stage there is clear understanding that security is one of the major concerns for proximity services. This is especially the case when one or more communicating stations in a logical cluster do not have an active connection to the serving base station. In this paper we propose a solution for secure throughput optimized communications in D2D-assisted cellular system. In order to provide additional throughput, a game-theoretic optimization approach is considered by taking into account social relationships and devices proximity. The proposed solution is agnostic to the chosen D2D communications technology (i.e., WiFi or LTE) and suitable for any possible cluster combination in full and partial cellular coverage. Performance evaluation of the proposed security framework show that social proximity information available at the D2D devices may substantially improves the system performance in term of throughput with respect to the standard security procedures. Finally, for sake of completeness, the effect of mobility for the reference scenario is evaluated. © 2016 FRUCT.","","Cellular telephone systems; Game theory; Innovation; Security of data; Throughput; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cellular coverage; D2D communications; Optimization approach; Proximity service; Security frameworks; Security procedures; Social relationships; Throughput-optimized; Mobile telecommunication systems"

In this paper, we set out to investigate users' susceptibility to cybercriminal attacks by concentrating at the most fundamental component governing user behavior - the human brain. We introduce a novel neuroscience-based study methodology to inform the design of user-centered security systems as it relates to cybercrime. In particular, we report on an functional magnetic resonance imaging study measuring users' security performance and underlying neural activity with respect to two critical security tasks: 1) distinguishing between a legitimate and a phishing website and 2) heeding security (malware) warnings. We identify the neural markers that might be controlling users' performance in these tasks, and establish relationships between brain activity and behavioral performance as well as between users' personality traits and security behavior. Our results provide a largely positive perspective on users' capability and performance vis-à-vis these crucial security tasks. First, we show that users exhibit significant brain activity in key regions associated with decision-making, attention, and problem-solving (phishing and malware warnings) as well as language comprehension and reading (malware warnings), which means that users are actively engaged in these security tasks. Second, we demonstrate that certain individual traits, such as impulsivity measured via an established questionnaire, are associated with a significant negative effect on brain activation in these tasks. Third, we discover a high degree of correlation in brain activity (in decision-making regions) across phishing detection and malware warnings tasks, which implies that users' behavior in one task may potentially be predicted by their behavior in the other. Fourth, we discover high functional connectivity among the core regions of the brain, while users performed the phishing detection task. Finally, we discuss the broader impacts and implications of our work on the field of user-centered security, including the domain of security education, targeted security training, and security screening. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","computer crime user interfaces; computer security; human computer interaction; human computer interaction security; Human factors","Behavioral research; Brain; Computer crime; Decision making; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Magnetic resonance imaging; Malware; Network security; Neurons; Neurophysiology; Problem solving; Security of data; Security systems; User interfaces; Behavioral performance; Degree of correlations; Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Fundamental component; Language comprehensions; Phishing detections; Security performance; Functional neuroimaging"

Specifically, we develop an architectural framework for tactical WSNs by studying security gaps and vulnerabilities within the 6LoWPAN security sublayer which is based on IEEE 802.15.4. We develop a key management scheme that is non-broadcast but that is also feasible in an operational scenario. In addition, we modify the 6LoWPAN packet structure to facilitate the newly developed keying mechanism. The tactical WSN architecture is designed to defend against a variety of network attacks that can potentially occur.

Identifying security goals is a process of iteration and refinement, leveraging the knowledge and expertise of the analyst to secure not only the core functionality but the security mechanisms as well. Moreover, a comprehensive security plan should include goals for not only preventing a breach, but also for detecting and appropriately responding in case a breach does occur. Goal: The objective of this research is to support analysts in security requirements engineering by providing a framework that supports a systematic and comprehensive discovery of security goals for a software system. Method: We develop a framework, Discovering Goals for Security (DIGS), that models the key entities in information security, including assets and security goals. We systematically develop a set of security goal patterns that capture multiple dimensions of security for assets. DIGS explicitly captures the relations and assumptions that underlie security goals to elicit implied goals. We map the goal patterns to NIST controls to help in operationalizing the goals. We evaluate DIGS via a controlled experiment where 28 participants analyzed systems from mobile banking and human resource management domains. Results: Participants considered security goals commensurate to the knowledge available to them. Although the overall recall was low given the empirical constraints, participants using DIGS identified more implied goals and felt more confident in completing the task. Conclusion: Explicitly providing the additional knowledge for the identification of implied security goals significantly increased the chances of discovering such goals, thereby improving coverage of stakeholder security requirements, even if they are unstated. © 2016 ACM.","controlled experiment; Security goals; security requirements","Computer software; Human resource management; Iterative methods; Knowledge management; Security of data; Software engineering; Additional knowledge; Controlled experiment; Core functionality; Multiple dimensions; Resource management; Security goals; Security requirements; Security requirements engineering; Requirements engineering"

Sixty-nine thousand six hundred forty-six vulnerabilities from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the SecurityFocus Vulnerability Database were harvested, integrated and categorized according to the analysts responsible for their disclosure as well as by the affected software products. Probability distributions were fitted to the TBVD per analyst and product. Among competing distributions, the Gamma distribution demonstrated the best fit, with the shape parameter, k, similar for most products and analysts, while the scale parameter, θ, differed significantly. For forecasting, autoregressive models of the first order were fitted to the TBVD time series for various products. Evaluation demonstrated that forecasting of TBVD on a per product basis was feasible. Products were also characterized by their relative susceptibility to vulnerabilities with impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability respectively. The differences in TBVD between products is significant, e.g. spanning differences of over 500% among the 20 most common software products in our data. Differences are further accentuated by the differing impact, so that, e.g., the mean working time between disclosure of vulnerabilities with a complete impact on integrity (as defined by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System) for Linux (110 days) exceeds that of Windows 7 (6 days) by over 18 times. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cyber security; Distribution fitting; Information security; Software vulnerability; Time between vulnerability disclosures; Time series analysis","Computer operating systems; Security of data; Time series analysis; Common vulnerability scoring systems; Cyber security; Distribution fitting; National vulnerability database; Probabilistic estimates; Software vulnerabilities; Vulnerability disclosure; Zero day vulnerabilities; Probability distributions"

And this impact will keep rising in the future power grid. Thus, in the power grid blackout defense, the impact of communication/information security must be taken into account. The paper proposes the concept of three defense lines for the communication/information system first. Based on this concept, the communication/information security defense system is built with the functions of risk early warning and failure control strategy decision support. Then the framework of the power grid blackout defense system integrating power grid defense and communication/information defense is presented. And the method of coordinating power grid emergency control and communication/information preventive/emergency/corrective control is discussed.

However, the flourish of skyline computation still faces many challenges including information security and privacy-preserving concerns. In this paper, we propose a new efficient and privacy-preserving skyline computation framework across multiple domains, called EPSC. Within EPSC framework, a skyline result from multiple service providers will be securely computed to provide better services for the client. Meanwhile, minimum privacy disclosure will be elicited from one service provider to another during skyline computation. Specifically, to leverage the service provider's privacy disclosure and achieve almost real-time skyline processing and transmission, we introduce an efficient secure vector comparison protocol (ESVC) to construct EPSC, which is exclusively based on two novel techniques: fast secure permutation protocol (FSPP) and fast secure integer comparison protocol (FSIC). Both protocols allow multiple service providers to calculate skyline result interactively in a privacy-preserving way. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed EPSC framework can achieve multi-domain skyline computation without leaking sensitive information to each other. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations also demonstrate the EPSC's efficiency in terms of providing skyline computation and transmission while minimizing the privacy disclosure across different domains. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Lightweight additive homomorphic encryption; Multi-domain; Secure computation framework; Semi-honest; Skyline","Big data; Cryptography; Security of data; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Multi domains; Secure computation; Semi-honest; Skyline; Data privacy"

This perception is not wrong; encrypted storage, memory and communications usually perform much slower than systems which process data in the clear. Big Data applications is no exception to the rule: it was designed with Volume and Velocity requirements in mind, and security (i.e. encryption) was initially not considered; perimeter security was deemed sufficient, and Big Data systems were confined to back-end operations. Considering the recent developments in the field (AES-NI processors, Key Management Servers, homomorphic encryption), the encryption vs performance paradigm needs to be actually measured to re-evaluate preconceived reservation. This research found that encryption is no longer an obstacle to efficient and fast Big Data processing, thanks to massive processing parallelisation (which distributes also the encryption payload), new CPU technologies which allow encryption instructions to perform much faster, the use of SSD storage, and finally the clever data-centric use of encryption in HDFS. The paper provides analysis of four strategies in using data encryption in Hadoop based Big Data applications, which have been tested on the testbed built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform using advanced AWS monitoring data.

The method is intended to solve the problem of data classification in the internal audit of computer equipment with a large volume of data stored on the media. The parametric space of informative features for the classification task is defined. To conduct internal audit of computer technologies in order to analyze the information security incidents we need data related directly with the user's action. While OS data are considered a priori as legitimate. With the growing volume of stored and processed information there is a need for accurate classification of user and system data to ensure that expert is analyzing only the information that can attribute itself with the information security incident. Thus, carrying out classification with high precision, it is possible to reduce the probability of the expert error during the internal audit of large amounts of data of operating system and application software. The method consists of several stages. The first stage involves the collecting of samples out of virtual machines running the Windows 10 operating system. Then the attributes of data stored on the hard disk are retrieved. Further, the received set of attributes is written to a 'csv' file with a specific structure. On the final stage the informativity of features for further classification of files to user or system is determined. This method has the potential for development and showed its applicability in tasks of data classification to user or system. The feature informativity for accurate classification was identified. The comparison of three classification algorithms was carried out and the Naive Bayes classifier was selected. The method can be used not only in tasks of internal audit of computer equipment under the influence of information security violation threats, but for the purpose of computer forensics, which is investigation of information security incidents. © 2016 FRUCT.","","Application programs; Classifiers; Computer forensics; Innovation; Security of data; Windows operating system; Classification algorithm; Classification tasks; Computer equipments; Computer technology; Information security incidents; Large amounts of data; Naive Bayes classifiers; Processed information; Classification (of information)"

Aiming at visual original biometric data, related tests and analysis on key space, sensitivity, correlation, and uniform distribution are performed with comparison to diverse schemes including triple data encryption standard algorithm and logistic mapping cipher. Experiments results show that the proposed approach possesses good secure performances on both random scrambling in space domain and uniform distribution in frequency domain.

All caches today are susceptible to cache side-channel attacks, despite software isolation of memory pages in virtual address spaces or virtual machines. These cache attacks can leak secret encryption keys or private identity keys, nullifying any protection provided by strong cryptography. Newcache uses a novel dynamic, randomized memory-to-cache mapping to thwart contention-based side-channel attacks, rather than the static mapping used by conventional set-associative caches. In this article, the authors present an improved design of Newcache, in terms of security, circuit design and simplicity. They show Newcache's security against a suite of cache side-channel attacks. They evaluate Newcache's system performance for cloud computing, smartphone, and SPEC benchmarks and find that Newcache performs as well as conventional set-associative caches, and sometimes better. They also designed a VLSI test chip with a 32-Kbyte Newcache and a 32-Kbyte, eight-way, set-associative cache and verified that the access latency, power, and area of the two caches are comparable.

Utilizing a laboratory experiment on data privacy training and a field study involving IT security training for employees of a bank, we test whether a training environment with basic gamification elements results in greater trainee satisfaction and knowledge acquisition than traditional, non-gamified training. We find basic gamification results in higher satisfaction levels in the lab and field, but only marginally significant improvements in learning. Furthermore, these learning improvements are quite small (e.g., 1 to 3 percent).

Since the measurement of information security is generally underdeveloped in practice and many organizations find the existing recommendations too complex, the paper presents a solution in the form of a 10 by 10 information security performance measurement model. The model - ISP 10×10M is composed of ten critical success factors, 100 key performance indicators and 6 performance levels. Its content was devised on the basis of findings presented in the current research studies and standards, while its structure results from an empirical research conducted among information security professionals from Slovenia. Results of the study show that a high level of information security performance is mostly dependent on measures aimed at managing information risks, employees and information sources, while formal and environmental factors have a lesser impact. Experts believe that information security should evolve systematically, where it's recommended that beginning steps include technical, logical and physical security controls, while advanced activities should relate predominantly strategic management activities. By applying the proposed model, organizations are able to determine the actual level of information security performance based on the weighted indexing technique. In this manner they identify the measures they ought to develop in order to improve the current situation. The ISP 10×10M is a useful tool for conducting internal system evaluations and decision-making.

For a SIS, its confidential information (named as ""secret"") may be leaked through the working behaviors of each Distributed Control Unit (DCU) from an outside observer called an ""intruder"" which is able to determine ship’s mission state by detecting the source of each data flow from the corresponding DCUs in SIS. Therefore we proposed a dual layer mechanism to enforce opacity by activating non-essential DCU during secret mission. This mechanism is calculated by two types of insertion functions: Safety-assured insertion function (fIS) and Admissibility-assured insertion function (fIA). Due to different objectives, fIS is designed to confuse intruder by constructing a non-secret behaviors from a unsafe one, and the division of fIA is to polish the modified output behaviors back to normal. We define the property of ""I2eEnforceability"" that dual layer insertion functions has the ability to enforce opacity. By a given mission map of SIS and the marked secret missions, we propose an algorithm to select fIS and compute its matchable fIA and then the DCUs which should be activated to release non-essential data flow in each step is calculable. © 2016 Society of Naval Architects of Korea.","Enforcing opacity; Insertion function; Ship information system","Data transfer; Distributed parameter control systems; Information systems; Ships; Surveying instruments; Confidential information; Cyber security; Distributed control; Dual layer; Insertion function; Non essential; Security properties; Working behavior; Opacity"

However, an attacker can easily access the exported components and private app information by evading permission checks in Android. In this article, the authors discuss a new attack called a direct resource hijacking attack (or resource hijacking attack), which directly hijacks exported components or permissions on components owned by a benign app. They find that among the top 230 popular apps, 53 are vulnerable to this attack. To tackle this vulnerability, they propose a fine-grained resource access control framework in Android and introduce a certificate-augmented resource naming mechanism.

Herein, we demonstrate an optical approach to characterise the nanoscale-precision signatures of silicon random structures towards realising low-cost and high-value information security technology. Unique and versatile silicon nanostructures are generated via resist collapse phenomena, which contains dimensions that are well below the diffraction limit of light. We exploit the nanoscale precision ability of confocal laser microscopy in the height dimension; our experimental results demonstrate that the vertical precision of measurement is essential in satisfying the performances required for artifact metrics. Furthermore, by using state-of-the-art nanostructuring technology, we experimentally fabricate clones from the genuine devices. We demonstrate that the statistical properties of the genuine and clone devices are successfully exploited, showing that the liveness-detection-type approach, which is widely deployed in biometrics, is valid in artificially-constructed solid-state nanostructures.

Furthermore, in a home gateway, an individual's behavior can be indirectly understood, for example, by examining the utilization status of electric power in the home. However, such handling of a home gateway is problematic in terms of privacy protection and other concerns. In this study, we performed risk assessment for a smart grid by comprehensively extracting the risk factors of the smart grid with the Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) method and then analyzing and evaluating the factors. Results showed that there are 37 risk factors for a typical smart grid, including risks related to electric power data, the home gateway itself, personal information protection, and privacy protection.

To date,various approaches have been proposed to detect these attacks,but with limited success when they are used in the real world. In this paper we propose a Technique which uses Fuzzy based system for the detection of the malicious node present inside the network. The schemes uses Fuzzy If-Then rules and the membership functions to define the threshold limit through which it will identify the misbehaviour of the nodes present in the network and declares it as a flooder or malicious node.

In the previous environment of second generation, the medical information was managed and utilized within the medical institutions. However, the recent EHR (Electronic Health Record), which has received attention lately and is expected to spread and be utilized fast, is highly recognized as the high-tech medical information technology which integrates the electronic medical records (EMR) in all the hospitals through network for sharing. EHR is known to be effective as it can improve the compatibility by integrating the patients’ medical treatment data and can also improve the effect of the treatment while reducing overlapping investments and waste through standardization. However, there is no clear solution to the problems of the compatibility according to the medical process and forms of data and system, and the leakage of personal and medical information. Therefore, this thesis proposes the method of managing account and authority, the encryption method of attribute-driven data, and the method of the log management.

Among the many forms of information leakage, covert timing channels can be dangerous primarily because they involve two parties intentionally colluding to exfiltrate sensitive data by subverting the underlying system security policy. The attackers establish an illegitimate communication channel between two processes and transmit information via resource timing modulation, which does not leave any physical activity trace for later forensic analysis. Recent studies have shown the vulnerability of many popular computing environments, such as cloud computing, to these covert timing channels. With the advancements in software confinement mechanisms, shared processor hardware structures will be natural targets for malicious attackers to exploit and implement their covert-timing-based channels. In this work, the authors present a microarchitecture-level framework that detects the possible presence of covert timing channels on shared hardware. Their experiments demonstrate their ability to successfully detect different types of covert timing channels on various hardware structures and communication patterns. © 1981-2012 IEEE.","algorithms; covert channels; detection; hardware timing channels; security","Algorithms; Data privacy; Error detection; Timing circuits; Communication pattern; Computing environments; Confinement mechanisms; Covert channels; Covert timing channels; Micro architectures; security; Timing channels; Hardware"

Securing information from unauthorized access,modification and destruction,maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Though many security techniques exist to secure information,well known and widely used is a cryptography and steganography. Cryptography is the art of changing the text into an unintelligible content at the sender and it is changed again into readable content at the receiver end. Steganography is hiding the content to the any digital media like image,video and audio which cannot be seen. The ultimate goal of steganography rather than robustness is that the adversary,not even able to identify that the media contains the secret message. The strength of steganography applications depends on the result of the stego object. The difference between the original object and stego object should not be more in terms of visual and statistical properties. This paper provides the review of various steganography techniques in different domains,performance evaluation metrics,key issues,discussion on the latest methods and future directions in this field.

Methods: Methods of restructuring ideas and theories, system and structural and functional, formal legal analysis and forecasting were applied throughout this research to the very phenomena of national security and activity of subjects shaping and maintaining such phenomenon, based on the methodological position. Their application logics relies on an attempt to integrate methodological approaches of various disciplines into the research of national security, and support forms and methods. Findings: This article concludes that the national security is a complex phenomenon and thus a system of interacting components. This system comprises a certain set of concepts and provisions, social and political and legal institutions and establishments, certain means, methods and forms that prevent or ensure an adequate response to any arising dangers and threats. Comparative legal analysis of international expertise in Western European countries and the USA allowed determining new lines of improvement of the administrative legal regulation in the following areas: counteraction of extremist activity; counteraction of illegal migration; combating human trafficking. This article suggests dividing national security into the following types: foreign policy threats to national security, public security, economic security, foreign economic security, military security, information security, environmental and demographic security. National security doctrine in any country is the original conceptual model of stating and resolving a common integrated set of standardized tasks and problems associated with providing protection of national interests. Applications/Improvements: Academic novelty of this research is in an attempt of fundamental theoretical analysis of the phenomenon of 'national security' as a governmental legal phenomenon with strengthening perspectives in Ukraine, establishing equilibrium of public and personal interests, providing sound protection of individual rights and legal interests.","Administrative legal support; International expertise; National security",""

To deal with these problems, first, the original problem is transformed into whether a point is the solution of equation. Based on the technique, a simple and efficient scalar product protocol is adopted to determine five spatial relationships all at once: point and line, point and plane, line and line, line and plane, and plane and plane. In addition, the security of the proposed protocol is proved with simulation paradigm.

The coupled manufacturing cyber-physical system is envisioned to handle the actual operations in the physical world while simultaneously monitor them in the cyber world with the help of advanced data processing and simulation models at both the manufacturing process and system operational levels. Moreover, a sensor-packed manufacturing system in which each process or piece of equipment makes available event and status information, coupled with market research for true advanced Big Data analytics, seem to be the right ingredients for event response selection and operation virtualization. As a drawback, the resulting manufacturing cyber-physical system will be vulnerable to the inevitable cyber-attacks, unfortunately, so common for the software and Internet-based systems. This reality makes cybersecurity penetration within the manufacturing domain a need that goes uncontested across researchers and practitioners. This work provides a review of the current status of virtualization and cloud-based services for manufacturing systems and of the use of Big Data analytics for planning and control of manufacturing operations.

Communication in such devices presents two challenges: security and resource limitation. Lightweight ciphers, such as HIGHT cipher, are encryption algorithms targeted for low resource systems. Designing lightweight ciphers in reconfigurable platform (e.g., field-programmable gate array) provides speedup as well as flexibility. The HIGHT cipher consists of simple operations and provides adequate security level. The objective of this research work is to design, optimize, and model FPGA implementation of the HIGHT cipher. Several optimized designs are presented to minimize the required hardware resources and energy including the scalar and pipeline ones. Our analysis shows that the scalar designs have smaller area and power dissipation, whereas the pipeline designs have higher throughput and lower energy. Because of the fact that obtaining the best performance out of any implemented design mainly requires balancing the design area and energy, our experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain such optimal performance using the pipeline design with two and four rounds per stage as well as with the scalar design with one and eight rounds. Comparing the best implementations of pipeline and scalar designs, the scalar design requires 18% less resources and 10% less power, while the pipeline design has 18 times higher throughput and 60% less energy consumption.

Given the improvement in firms' information environments and the better protection for investors generated by cross-listing, does cross-listing help firms to reduce the negative impacts caused by their announcements of ISBs? This paper conducts an event study of 120 publicly traded firms (among which 25 cross-list and 95 do not), in order to explore the answer. The results indicate that the impact of ISB announcements on a firm's stock prices shows no difference between cross-listing firms and non-cross-listing firms.

This may yield limited models, since, for example, command execution (an action) usually ends up in the transformation of a file (the object). The overall goal of this paper is to prove that the object is paramount to distinguishing a user from a masquerade. With this in mind, we have developed a new approach to masquerade detection, called file system navigation, and tested our ideas using the Windows-Users and Windows-Intruder simulations Logs Data set, (WUIL) which unlike other datasets of its kind includes close-to-real simulated attacks. We have shown that our approach makes it possible to capture computer behavior in an abstract way difficult to realize in a purely action-based approach. In this paper, we introduce an abstraction called locality, the tendency of programs to cluster references to memory. While temporal locality is applicable to both actions and objects, spatial locality is more suitable to objects, as it depends on a notion of position. We have successfully validated our working hypothesis: locality-based features better capture user behavior for masquerade detection. Particularly, results based on our approach report an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.97 in average with 30% of users having an AUC equal to or above 0.99. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Information Security; Masquerade Detection","Abstracting; Air navigation; Behavioral research; Security of data; Area under the curves; Masquerade detection; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Simulated attacks; Spatial locality; Temporal and spatial; Temporal locality; User behaviors; Intrusion detection"

Recently, An pointed out the weaknesses of Das's three-factor remote user authentication scheme and proposed an improved biometric-based three-factor remote user authentication scheme. An's scheme improves the security problems of previous schemes while keeping the efficiency. However, after detailed analysis, we find that An's scheme exists some weaknesses such as vulnerable to denial-of-service attack and forgery attack, cannot detect unauthorized login quickly, and does not provide session key agreement.

Cryptography is the mathematical technique of hiding information for ensuring authentication,confidentiality and other aspects of information security. The growing aspect of data transmission needs an exceptional means of security over the network. Cryptanalysis attack has to be difficult for the third party access. These emphasize the demand for light weight concept in encryption. An Authenticated Lightweight Encryption (ALE) is an individual-path nonce-based encryption algorithm which uses associated data. It implements the combination of both AES-128 bit key schedule and their round transformation. ALE provides better security and high performance than other encryption techniques but it leads to Slide attack which occurs when the periodic process illustrates self-similarity and independent of the iterated round function. It is prevented by avoiding the self-similarity of a periodic process by adding iteration counters and random constants which is fixed. It employs all symmetric cryptographic functions,from hashing to authenticated encryption and random number generation. Thus a cryptographic process based on AES technique,implemented with lightweight algorithm and lightweight hash function is proposed for better security. © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

Design/methodology/approach:- For the identification of IG requirements a systematic literature review is conducted. The practical significance of identified IG requirements is evaluated through a case study. Findings:- A comprehensive list of IG requirements in dynamic BN is identified. These requirements are classified in information quality, information security, and metadata domains. The conducted case study demonstrates information exchange issues in a real world dynamic BN that reflects the practical significance of the identified IG requirements. Research limitations/implications:- Exploiting emerging market opportunities through a dynamic BN necessitates the realization of a comprehensive IG program within the network. Otherwise, information exchange related risks can interrupt the operations in a BN. In this research the authors concentrate on interactions between parties within a BN. The interactions with customers for the co-creation of value are not addressed directly. Although the conducted case study reflects the practical significance of the identified IG requirements clearly, more empirical study is needed for prioritizing these IG requirements. Practical implications:- The governor of a BN needs to balance between the value obtained from dynamic networked interactions and the risk evolving from the dynamic inter-organizational information exchange. Originality/value:- The comprehensive list of IG requirements that are identified in this research can be used to develop an IG program that enables high quality and secure information exchange in a dynamic BN. © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business networking; Information governance; Information quality; Information security; Inter-organizational business process; Metadata","Information analysis; Metadata; Security of data; Co-creation of values; Design/methodology/approach; Information governance; Information quality; Inter-organizational information exchanges; Interorganizational business process; Networked interactions; Systematic literature review; Information dissemination"

While this is enabling a revolution in the way humans interact with each other and data, it also is exposing previously unreachable infrastructure to a worldwide set of actors. Existing solutions for intrusion detection and prevention that are signature-focused typically seek to detect anomalous and/or malicious activity for the sake of preventing or mitigating negative impacts. But a growing interest in behavior-based detection is driving new forms of analysis that move the emphasis from static indicators (e.g. rule-based alarms or tripwires) to behavioral indicators that accommodate a wider contextual perspective. Similar to cyber systems, biosystems have always existed in resource-constrained hostile environments where behaviors are tuned by context. So we look to biosystems as an inspiration for addressing behavior-based cyber challenges. In this paper, we introduce LINEBACKER, a behavior-model based approach to recognizing anomalous events in network traffic and present the design of this approach of bio-inspired and statistical models working in tandem to produce individualized alerting for a collection of systems. Preliminary results of these models operating on historic data are presented along with a plugin to support real-world cyber operations. © 2016 IEEE.","biosequence model; cybersecurity; Leaky buckets","Biological systems; Human computer interaction; Intrusion detection; Analysis and characterization; Behavior-based detection; Behavioral indicators; Cyber security; Hostile environments; Intrusion detection and prevention; Leaky buckets; Malicious activities; Behavioral research"

It is based on the fraud diamond which comprises four components: pressure (i.e. motive), opportunity, capability and rationalisation. In general, it has been found that a criminal must have the motive and opportunity to commit a crime. However, the criminal must also have the capability to commit crime particularly in the cybercrime domain. Furthermore, criminals tend to rationalise (i.e. excuse) their crimes. The model presented here involves leveraging the fraud diamond to predict and prevent insider threats. Typically insider threat prediction and prevention models tend to overlook the privacy concerns of insiders. Hence the deployment of the model involves gathering information about the insider's possible intent within a privacy-preserving context. This will help to identify high risk insider threats while balancing privacy concerns. © 2015 IEEE.","Context aware system; Fraud diamond; Information security; Insider threat","Data privacy; Diamonds; Forecasting; Security of data; Context-Aware; Context-aware systems; Insider Threat; Prevention models; Privacy concerns; Privacy preserving; Rationalisation; Techniques and tools; Crime"

Escalations in authentication technologies like behavioral blocks and biometric data breaches are reducing the user's control over the management of their digital identities. Simultaneously, users are becoming more digitally dependant regarding financial transactions, buying food, emotionally connecting with loved ones on social media, managing personal information, and writing personal documents. This research presents a tool to address this issue pulled from the fields of education, political science, psychology, and cyber security. It is combined as a set of models to be delivered as part of information security curricula. Recent analysis of brain scans and population behavior studies have suggested that when people feel their identity at risk and feel disempowered they will have a stronger disposition towards authoritarianism, desire for retribution, and a desire for simplistic solutions instead of acting with reasoned and adaptive responses. Indicators in other fields suggest that the way professionals and educators characterize incidents that threaten digital identity can habituate different types of societal attitudes about the Internet and institutional data usage.

Historically, insurance companies have been significant collectors and users of customer-related information; the age of ""Big Data"" has greatly accelerated both the types of information collected and how it is used, creating new opportunities for developing, underwriting, and marketing insurance products. However, the online or cyber world similarly creates new challenges for regulators and risks to consumers, including the complexity of underwriting and risk classifications, multiple distribution channels that cross regulatory boundaries and are increasingly global in reach, and consumer privacy and ownership of data. These new realities in turn implicate the growing risk of cyber or data breaches and the ability of third parties to illegally access and utilize the immense amounts of confidential information insurers and other institutions now routinely collect. This chapter examines these issues in the United States. The online world is fluid almost by definition, and perhaps one of its few certainties is that any quantitative summary will be out of date shortly after publication. Therefore, while we have attempted to provide the most current information available, our focus is on industry and regulatory trends and the structure and sources of insurance and consumer protection regulation in the U.S., which provide the framework for evaluating the future of insurance online and the relationships among insurers, insurance intermediaries, regulators (state, federal, and international), and insurance consumers. While there are relatively few laws that specifically address the online sale of insurance, existing consumer protection and insurance laws and regulations are often sufficiently flexible to encompass the online world, particularly in areas of deceptive advertising, unfair trade practices, and email spam. In other areas, such as cybersecurity, regulatory responses are rapidly emerging. After the introduction in Sect. 1, our chapter reviews the online sale of life and property casualty insurance, summarizes insurance regulation in the United States (itself in a state of flux), and then discusses insurance regulation and consumer protection laws applicable to the online sale and marketing of insurance, concluding with the security of data held by insurers and other financial service companies. Insurers are both sources of cyber risk and, by underwriting cyber insurance, providers of an important tool to address and mitigate this risk. In this area, the interests of government, insurers, intermediaries, policyholders, and other consumers potentially merge, with the acknowledgement that a strong cyber insurance market can contribute significantly to the nation's economy and security. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

We provide a systematic approach rooted from the information theory to evaluate the basic performance limits of RF fingerprinting. We develop a novel channel model for RF fingerprinting, where the imperfections in the RF chain are modeled as a fingerprint channel, cascaded to the actual physical channel. We address the authentication problem in the presence of an adversary, where both the legitimate transmitter and the adversary are equipped with unique fingerprint channels, in addition to a possible secret key available at the legitimate nodes. We provide bounds for the error exponents for reliable communication of the legitimate nodes, and the success exponent for impersonation and substitution attacks of the adversary, as a function of certain parameters based on their RF-fingerprints, and the shared key rate. We illustrate that keyless authentication is possible via RF fingerprints when the legitimate channel is not simulatable. We also show that the probability of these attacks can be reduced significantly by employing additional dedicated authenticated nodes. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","authentication; cybersecurity; error exponent; impersonation attack; keyless authentication; RF-Fingerprinting; secrecy exponent; secure communication; simulatability; substitution attack","Authentication; Chains; Error correction; Information theory; Radio stations; Radio transmission; Secure communication; Transmitters; Cyber security; Error exponent; Impersonation attack; RF-Fingerprinting; secrecy exponent; Simulatability; Substitution attack; Cryptography"

Information security is an organization-wide common mission; whose success strongly depends on efficient knowledge sharing. For this purpose, semantic wikis have proved their strength as a flexible collaboration and knowledge sharing platforms. However, there has not been notable academic research on how semantic wikis could be used as information security management platform in organizations for improved cyber resilience. In this paper, we propose to use semantic wiki as an agile information security management platform. More precisely, the wiki contents are based on the structured model of the NIST Special Publication 800-53 information security control catalogue that is extended in the research with the additional properties that support the information security management and especially the security control implementation. We present common uses cases to manage the information security in organizations and how the use cases can be implemented using the semantic wiki platform. As organizations seek cyber resilience, where focus is in the availability of cyber-related assets and services, we extend the control selection with option to focus on availability. The results of the study show that a semantic wiki based information security management and collaboration platform can provide a cost-efficient solution for improved cyber resilience, especially for small and medium sized organizations that struggle to develop information security with the limited resources. © 2016 ACM.","Cyber resilience; Information security management; Risk management; Semantic wiki","Industrial management; Knowledge management; Risk management; Semantics; Collaboration platforms; Computing infrastructures; Cyber resilience; Information security controls; Information security managements; Knowledge-sharing platform; Medium sized organizations; Semantic wiki; Security of data"

The debate on how to handle the trade-off between collecting signals and protecting privacy is international, and Herb Lin argues in the book for a role of the market in that endeavor. Some terrorist organizations such as Al Qaida have lost some of their power and cohesion, and the intelligence community has made some real progress in thwarting their destructive efforts. The fight against terrorists has taken a new dimension. The possibility that they could get their hands on nuclear weapons raises new fears and calls for new measures. The number of nations possessing or developing nuclear arsenals is increasing.

Shoulder surfing and network snooping were the most commonly cited classes of risk, and perceived risk was influenced by the surrounding environment and source of information. However, overall risk awareness was low. The possible risks of device theft and loss, hacking, malware and data stored on devices were not prominent concerns.

However, there are still great disparities in the level of e-government development between the developed and developing worlds, with Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) lagging behind all other regions. The reason for these disparities has so far been attributed to differences in national income; nonetheless, some resource-poor countries have succeeded to make great strides in e-government development. As such, there has been a call to examine other indicators of e-government development, since national income alone does not paint a detailed picture. In this light, this study examined a total of six indicators (corruption, gender equality, population age, national income, cybersecurity, and innovation) that are believed to influence e-government development using SSA as the case study. Macro-level indices were used to capture country level data from 49 SSA countries. The findings indicated that all the factors significantly influenced e-government development in SSA.

Such fragmentation of data leads to challenges of system processing inefficiencies, poor synchronization of reports, delayed decision making and hinders quick response to business demands. This calls for the integration of legacy systems into a single repository system to enable a central processing of data and improve decision making. However, such integration is always resisted by user. The objective of this paper was to identify factors influencing user acceptance of Legacy system integration. Data for the study was collected by using a close-ended questionnaire from a government department in South Africa. The collected data was analysed quantitatively and results indicated that culture, trust, social influence, information quality, and system quality are core antecedents of the acceptance of Legacy systems integration. This paper examines the factors that contribute positively or negatively to the user acceptance of legacy systems integration as well as those factors that could be considered by system developers when modernizing legacy systems. Management within organizations could leverage the findings of this study when dealing with issues of technology acceptance. This paper further provides a model for a relatively influential factors that could be considered by managers, developers and researchers that need a way to integrate standard data sets that are distributed across legacy systems. © 2016 IIMC.","Enterprise Resource Planning Systems; Legacy systems integration; user acceptance","Data handling; Data integration; Decision making; Enterprise resource planning; Information management; Enterprise resource planning systems; Government departments; Influential factors; Information quality; Management control; Systems integration; Technology acceptance; User acceptance; Legacy systems"

The Chinese mobile app market and health care system have peculiarities that distinguish them from other app markets. To date, Chinese mHealth apps have not been systematically investigated. Objective: The objective of this study was to provide an overview of Chinese mHealth apps as of December 2015. Methods: We identified and investigated the most downloaded apps from the iOS and Android platforms. For each app, we analyzed and recorded its main service offered, mHealth initiative, disease and specialty focus, app cost, target user, Web app availability, and emphasis on information security. Standard descriptive statistics were used. Results: A total of 234 apps met the inclusion criteria and were investigated. The apps targeting nonhealth care professionals focused on providing telemedicine and appointment-making services. The apps targeting health care professionals focused on education and peer reviewed articles. The most common disease-specific apps focused primarily on diabetes, hypertension, and hepatitis management. Most apps were free and available on both iOS and Android platforms. Conclusions: The primary mHealth initiatives targeted by the apps reflect Chinese patients' demand for access to medical care. Disease-specific apps are also representative of disease prevalence in China. Government press releases suggest that new policies on the horizon may shift the industry.","China; Medical informatics; MHealth; Mobile health applications","China; Humans; Mobile Applications; Telemedicine; China; human; mobile application; procedures; telemedicine"

This can be a potential information security threat as the sensitive information can be stolen from a distance without leaving any trace. The video leakage signals contain the information of the image displayed in the computer, so the video leakage signals can be seen as special image signals. However, different from the normal image signal, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of video leakage signal is low due to the environmental noise and many other man-made noises. In this paper, a novel wavelet based independent component analysis (ICA) method is proposed for improving SNR of computer video leakage signals. By using this method, we can improve the performance of pre-processing of computer video leaking signals. We solve the problem of using Fast ICA in processing video leakage signal by using a wavelet filter. The performance of Fast ICA is improved by working in wavelet domain because of advantages like ease of implementation and less computation time when compared to time domain. We pre-process one-dimensional received signal without reconstructing the image since it is inefficient to reconstruct signal before processing. A direct SNR can't be defined. Therefore, another metric called quasi signal to noise ratio (QSNR) is defined to estimate signal to noise ratio of video leakage signals. The processed results of the actual experimental data show that the proposed wavelet based ICA algorithm has a better performance than the Fast ICA algorithm and the Wavelet denoising algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.","image processing; independent component analysis; information security; noise reduction; signal pre-processing; wavelet transform","Algorithms; Electromagnetic waves; Image processing; Independent component analysis; Noise abatement; One dimensional; Security of data; Time domain analysis; Video signal processing; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Computer display; Environmental noise; Independent component analysis(ICA); Independent components; Information security threats; Pre-processing; Sensitive informations; Wavelet denoising algorithm; Signal to noise ratio"

Recent attacks by hackers on the databases of large commercial and financial companies have demonstrated that more research and development of advanced approaches are necessary to deny unauthorized access to critical data. Free space optical technology has been investigated by many researchers in information security, encryption, and authentication. The main motivation for using optics and photonics for information security is that optical waveforms possess many complex degrees of freedom such as amplitude, phase, polarization, large bandwidth, nonlinear transformations, quantum properties of photons, and multiplexing that can be combined in many ways to make information encryption more secure and more difficult to attack. This roadmap article presents an overview of the potential, recent advances, and challenges of optical security and encryption using free space optics. The roadmap on optical security is comprised of six categories that together include 16 short sections written by authors who have made relevant contributions in this field. The first category of this roadmap describes novel encryption approaches, including secure optical sensing which summarizes double random phase encryption applications and flaws [Yamaguchi], the digital holographic encryption in free space optical technique which describes encryption using multidimensional digital holography [Nomura], simultaneous encryption of multiple signals [Pérez-Cabré], asymmetric methods based on information truncation [Nishchal], and dynamic encryption of video sequences [Torroba]. Asymmetric and one-way cryptosystems are analyzed by Peng. The second category is on compression for encryption. In their respective contributions, Alfalou and Stern propose similar goals involving compressed data and compressive sensing encryption. The very important area of cryptanalysis is the topic of the third category with two sections: Sheridan reviews phase retrieval algorithms to perform different attacks, whereas Situ discusses nonlinear optical encryption techniques and the development of a rigorous optical information security theory. The fourth category with two contributions reports how encryption could be implemented at the nano- or micro-scale. Naruse discusses the use of nanostructures in security applications and Carnicer proposes encoding information in a tightly focused beam. In the fifth category, encryption based on ghost imaging using single-pixel detectors is also considered. In particular, the authors [Chen, Tajahuerce] emphasize the need for more specialized hardware and image processing algorithms. Finally, in the sixth category, Mosk and Javidi analyze in their corresponding papers how quantum imaging can benefit optical encryption systems. Sources that use few photons make encryption systems much more difficult to attack, providing a secure method for authentication. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Holography; Light; Mathematical transformations; Nonlinear optics; Optical data processing; Optical engineering; Personal computing; Phase space methods; Photons; Quantum cryptography; Double random phase encryptions; Encoding informations; Image processing algorithm; Non-linear transformations; Optical information security; Optical security and encryptions; Phase retrieval algorithm; Research and development; Authentication"

Typically, the first detector set is composed of detectors that match information flows associated with malicious apps while the second detector set is composed of detectors that match the information flows associated with benign apps. The mAIS presented in this paper incorporates feature selection along with a negative selection technique known as the split detector method (SDM). This new mAIS has been compared with a variety of conventional AISs and mAISs using a dataset of information flows captured from malicious and benign Android applications. Our preliminary results show that the newly designed mAIS outperforms the conventional AISs and mAISs in terms of accuracy and false positive rate of malware detection. This paper ends with a discussion of how mAISs can be used to solve dynamic cybersecurity problems as well as a discussion of our future research.

Conventional information assurance methods are facing increasing technological advances such as radical developments in mathematics, potential to perform big computations and the prospects of wide-ranging quantum computations. Quantum cryptography is a promising solution towards absolute security in cryptosystems. This paper proposes integration of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with quantum cryptography.

A multi-objective optimization model is proposed for real-time charging control aimed at maximization of the EV owners' benefit and minimization of the active power loss. By using the alternate direction method of multiplier (ADMM), the centralized optimization model of charging can be converted into individual sub-problems in the decentralized optimization model with the device as the unit. For each iteration of ADMM, only a bit of information is exchanged between the device and the adjacent interactive information points, which is conducive to protecting user information security. Meanwhile, some disadvantages due to centralized optimization can be overcome, such as high communication requirements and high computational overhead. Simulations for IEEE 33-bus and actual 119-bus network systems show that the results of the decentralized optimization model and the centralized model are conformable. Moreover, the proposed algorithm shows high computing efficiency, low communication cost and good applicability to the rolling scheduling schema in real-time. © 2016 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","Alternate direction method of multiplier (ADMM); Decentralized control strategy; Electric vehicles; Rolling optimization dispatch","Charging (batteries); Decentralized control; Electric power system economics; Electric vehicles; Iterative methods; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Security of data; Vehicles; Centralized optimization; Computational overheads; Decentralized optimization; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Interactive informations; Method of multipliers; Multi-objective optimization models; Rolling optimization; Electric machine control"

This method for synthetic data generation can be utilized for generating arbitrary prescribed probability density functions (pdf). The Smirnov transform is used to solve a cybersecurity engineering problem associated with Internet traffic. The synthetic Lévy-walk process is intertwined with sections of other distinct characteristics (uniform noise, Gaussian noise, and an ordinary sinusoid) to create a composite signal, which is then analyzed with zero-crossing rate (ZCR) within a varying-size window. This paper shows that it is possible to identify the distinct sections present in the composite signal through ZCR.

To ensure that IS is effectively enforced and executed, many organisations have introduced information security management (ISM) initiatives. IS standards, policies, guidelines and procedures are formulated to guide organisations in implementing ISM. Despite the extensive efforts, organisations are still exposed to security threats and risks due to ineffective ISM practices. One possible cause of this phenomenon is that organisations are unaware of the factors that influence the success of ISM. This study aims to address this concern by analysing the existing literature in order to identify the success factors of ISM. Six related studies together with the ISM international standard, guideline and model were reviewed and compared. To conceptualise the factors, the literature was analysed qualitatively using content analysis. Based on the analysis, the study has compiled a number of factors and elements that contribute to the success of ISM. The factors are grouped into three main aspects, namely People, Process and Organisation. The People need to possess certain attributes in order to perform the key ISM Process, which should be supported by the Organisation through the establishment of specific guidance. By understanding the ISM success factors, the ISM implementation in organisations is believed to be gradually improved and become effective. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

According to the perspective of the practical applications, improving the confidentiality and integrity of secret sharing schemes is a good method to increase the security and reliability of communications. In this paper, we propose a quantum secret sharing scheme based on generator matrix segmentation and the structural features of quantum graph states. The security of the secure secret sharing scheme is guaranteed by the pattern of transferring information by stabilizers, scalability of the information and new recovery strategy provided by the entanglement of the related graph states. It puts forward an effective solution to the problem of matrix cycle period, where some numbers without the primitive element cannot construct the generation matrix. First of all, the physical properties of quantum bits (qubits), such as uncertainty principle, no-cloning theorem and indistinguishability, not only optimize the classical schemes but also ensure the absolute safety of communication. Secondly, the application of matrix segmentation makes secret information has better scalability. It improves the coding diversity and the difficulty in deciphering. Thirdly, the favorable entanglement properties and mature experiment preparation techniques of graph states provide an approach to the practical applications. The superiority of the yielded graph states is described in graphical fashion with an elegant stabilizer. Fourthly, the shuffling operation can ensure the independence of the message among participants. Therefore, Eve can not obtain any useful information by measuring randomly. Two group-recovery protocols are proposed to show the secret recovering processing through rebuilding subsecrets among legal cooperative participants. In the scheme design, the dealer extracts the classical secret information according to the corresponding principle between the classical and quantum information, and divides the classical secret through generated matrix which is produced with the primitive elements in finite domain satisfying the linear independence for any k column vectors. Then the dealer encodes information into graph states and distributes particles to the legal participants with unitary operations. Subsequently, the credible center obtains sub-secrets by the theory of graph states and the group recovery protocol. He can achieve the initial classical secret via the inverse algorithm of matrix segmentation. After getting the classical secret, he recovers quantum secret according to the relationship between classical information and quantum information. Theoretical analysis shows that this scheme can provide better security and scalability of the information. It is appropriate to realize the secret sharing in the quantum network communication to protect secrets from eavesdropping. Also, it can provide an approach to designing diverse and scalable quantum secure communication schemes based on quantum graph states, the algorithm of matrix segmentation, and group-recovery protocol. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.","Generated matrix; Graph states; Group-recovery protocol; Quantum secret sharing","Information theory; Inverse problems; Matrix algebra; Physical properties; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Recovery; Scalability; Secure communication; Security of data; Entanglement properties; Graph state; Quantum secret sharing; Quantum secret sharing schemes; Recovery protocols; Secure communication scheme; Security and reliabilities; Uncertainty principles; Quantum cryptography"

In the last several years, there has been a disturbing trend in which attackers are innovating much faster than the defenders. There has been a commercialization of malware with attack kits available through underground forums for anyone who wants to perpetrate any variety of attacks. Large botnets are available for rent, allowing attackers to send spam or launch DDos (distributed denial-of-service) attacks. Many attackers reuse malware and command and control (C & C) and methods, adapting their products over time to keep ahead of the anti malware industry and security professionals.

Reasoning about dynamically computed authority is challenging. Integrity of the system might be compromised if attackers can improperly influence the authorizing computation. Confidentiality can also be compromised by authorization, since authorization decisions are often based on sensitive data such as membership lists and passwords. Previous formal models for authorization do not fully address the security implications of permitting trust relationships to change, which limits their ability to reason about authority that derives from dynamic computation. Our goal is a way to construct dynamic authorization mechanisms that do not violate confidentiality or integrity. We introduce the Flow-Limited Authorization Calculus (FLAC), which is both a simple, expressive model for reasoning about dynamic authorization and also an information flow control language for securely implementing various authorization mechanisms. FLAC combines the insights of two previous models: it extends the Dependency Core Calculus with features made possible by the Flow-Limited Authorization Model. FLAC provides strong end-to-end information security guarantees even for programs that incorporate and implement rich dynamic authorization mechanisms. These guarantees include noninterference and robust declassification, which prevent attackers from influencing information disclosures in unauthorized ways. We prove these security properties formally for all FLAC programs and explore the expressiveness of FLAC with several examples. © 2016 IEEE.","access control; authorization; dynamic authorization; flow-limited authorization; information flow control; information security","Access control; Calculations; Flow control; Security of data; Security systems; authorization; Authorization decision; Dependency core calculus; Dynamic computations; flow-limited authorization; Information disclosure; Information flow control; Security implications; Dynamics"

Encryption of data is the most effective way of computer science concerned with developing schemes and formula to achieve data & information security. In its course of action, it allows sequence to be encoded in the form of cipher text where it is extremely difficult to read or recognize the codes where decryption is the procedure to transforming encoded text into the original message and information. In this paper we present an algorithm for data encryption and decryption which is based on number theory. In addition, data encryption using strange number system (especially using pentaoctagesimal (SNS) can make available physical or substantial security to information - allowing updating only to authorized users. This algorithm is used pentaoctagesimal strange number system to encrypt data and we propose a better data encryption and decryption strategy, which will offer better security towards all possible ways of attacks while data transmission. In reference to data security, a Turing-Machine is a device based on hypothesis that manages numbers dexterously on stripe of tape according to conditions of the table. In contempt of its simplicity, Turing-Machine can be pertinent at any computer algorithm after simulating the logic that would be useful in illuminating the function of a CPU. In this research-work authors have proposed a notion that takes binary number for a given decimal number and simulate the binary number through Turing-Machine. As a result of which the next number can be generated in binary form. Further if again we calculate the decimal of the obtained binary digits, the resultant decimal number is one more than the previous decimal number. This approach would be helpful to generate next successor decimal number from a given decimal number. Further this approach of number generation through Turing machine would be helpful in cryptographic techniques where, generated number can be applied for data security enhancement at both sender as well as receiver end. © 2016 IEEE.","Binary Number; Cryptography; Decimal Number; Finite State; Turing Machine","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Bins; Character recognition; Computation theory; Cryptography; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Machinery; Number theory; Numbering systems; Security of data; Authorized users; Binary number; Course of action; Cryptographic techniques; Data encryption; Decimal Number; Finite state; Security enhancements; Turing machines"

Thus, in this paper, the risk factors identified in the previous study are analyzed and quantitatively evaluated. Specifically, the values of the risk factors were approximately calculated by using a risk formula used in the field of information security management systems (ISMS). In this way, it was found that the countermeasures in the previous study could reduce their corresponding risk factors by about 60%.

Unlike existing approaches, we provide a methodology for estimating the skill coefficient of different categories of attackers (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) by analyzing 15 years of vulnerability data in the NVD database.

One of the fundamental problems is to balance the conflicting requirements of security and usability. We argue that definition of objectives for security and usability allows for deciding about the right balance between security and usability. To this effect we propose two instruments for assessing security and usability of systems, and develop them in three phases. In Phase 1 we identified 16 clusters of means and 8 clusters of fundamental objectives using the value-focused thinking approach and interviews with 35 experts. Based on phase 1, in the second phase we collected a sample of 201 users to purify, and ensure reliability and unidimensionality of the two instruments. In the third phase, based on a sample of 418 users we confirmed and validated the two instruments found in Phase 2. This resulted in 14 means objectives organized into four categories (minimize system interruptions and licensing restrictions, maximize information retrieval, maximize system aesthetics, and maximize data quality), and 10 fundamental objectives grouped into four categories (maximize standardization and integration, maximize ease of use, enhance system related communication, and maximize system capability). The objectives offer a useful basis for assessing the extent to which security and usability has been achieved in systems. The objectives also provide a decision basis for balancing security and usability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Chaotic laser has proven to be a promising physical entropy source for high-speed RNG. Unfortunately, some defects of laser chaos such as sharp spectrum, time-delay signature and asymmetrical amplitude distribution, limit the generation speed and lead to requirement of complicated post processing. Here, we report a RNG method by using the optical heterodyne of two chaotic optical-feedback semiconductor lasers as entropy source. The optical heterodyne chaos has a flat spectrum, symmetric amplitude distribution, and has no time-delay signature; these merits can improve the RNG speed and reduce post-processing requirements. In experiments, we generate a flat-spectrum chaos with a 3-dB bandwidth of 16GHz. Using 8-bit analog-digital conversion at a sampling rate of 80Gb/s, we experimentally find that the random numbers directly extracted from the 5 least significant bits (LSBs) can pass the NIST randomness test without help of any post-processing method. That is, 400-Gb/s (5×80Gb/s) physical random number generation is achieved without post processing. © 2016 IEEE.","Bandwidth enhancement; Chaos; Post processing; Random number generation; Semiconductor laser; Time delay signature","Bandwidth; Chaos theory; Entropy; Feedback; Heterodyning; Optical communication; Photonics; Processing; Security of data; Semiconductor lasers; Time delay; Amplitude distributions; Bandwidth enhancement; Least significant bits; Optical heterodyne; Physical random numbers; Post processing; Postprocessing methods; Randomness test; Random number generation"

To do so, the secondary system adopts the physical-layer method of cooperative jamming and relaying to protect the primary confidential message in two stages and acquire some spectrum opportunities for the two-way transmission in both stages. In addition, we try to allocate the power for transmitting jamming signal, secondary messages, and relaying messages in such a way that the secrecy capacity of the primary system is maximized subject to the minimum secondary transmission rate requirements. Furthermore, a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) based iterative algorithm is proposed to solve this non-convex problem. Our proposed cooperative transmission scheme is reciprocally- benefited for both systems as the secondary system can access the licensed spectrum in both two slots and the primary confidential message can be protected from eavesdropping. In addition, we analyze the secrecy capacities for asymptotic scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the performance superiority of our proposed scheme over conventional cooperative secure communication scheme in terms of the primary secrecy capacity. © 2016 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Approximation algorithms; Iterative methods; Jamming; Network layers; Network security; Quality of service; Secure communication; Security of data; Transmissions; Confidential message; Convex approximation; Cooperative relaying; Cooperative transmission; Iterative algorithm; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Secure communication scheme; Two-way transmission; Cooperative communication"

Through a mixed method approach, the current study focused on the application of ICT in educational administration to enhance collaborative work across different administrative agencies in an university. A Chinese university was taken as an example. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 194 staff members of the student affairs office and the academic affairs office. The results of the structural equation modeling were explained by analyzing interviews with nine leaders from the aforementioned departments. We found that institution authority and information security exert a significantly positive effect on the degree of information sharing and the effect of agency collaboration, whereas cost has a significantly negative effect. Inter-organizational trust and organizational compatibility have a significant positive influence on the effect of agency collaboration. However, these factors do not have a significant influence on the degree of information sharing because of difficulties in differentiating them in the information sharing stage. The “operational abilities” factor does not have a significant influence on the degree of information sharing and agency collaboration, which can be attributed to the background of this study.

Those challenges will be based on information security management systems as well as on legal foundations. When considering the legal framework of security and privacy of the IoT, it has to be determined which model of regulation should be applied. Thereby, no traditional government regulation is actually appropriate for a global system such as IoT. The most important foundation consequently will be the regulatory foundations of European union (on the territory of EU) and, consequently building the model of self-regulation based partly on state and mostly on law international agreements which are to be considered as tools to govern the IoT.

Unfortunately, this technology progress may also bring with a big risk of the information security. Image region cloning is a popular and simple manner to create realistic forgery images. Most relevant researches have been carried out, but the methods based on those researches are only able to detect some simple duplicated successfully. So we present a new Radon Odd Radial Harmonic Fourier Moments (RORHFMs) method. Compared with other relevant methods, this method is more robust to resist post-processed operations, such as anti-translation, anti-rotation, anti-scaling, anti-mirror operations and resisted Gaussian noise contamination. We also introduce an auxiliary circle template to slide and detect the suspicious image in order to locate the cloned region. The invariant moment features of image are extracted and analyzed by our method. Each feature of similar region is arranged orderly by Lexicographic sorting for detecting. Pearson Correlation Coefficient is applied to calculate and classify the statistical data. Then, the statistical data is searched, analyzed. At last, the original coordinates of cloned and pasted region are detected and denoted. Extensive experiments verified better robustness of RORHFMs method than other relevant methods in detecting cloned forgery. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","An auxiliary circle template; Detecting cloned forgery; Forgery images; Post-processed operations; Radon odd radial harmonic Fourier moments","Clone cells; Correlation methods; Fourier transforms; Gaussian noise (electronic); Harmonic analysis; Image processing; Radon; Security of data; Statistics; An auxiliary circle template; Detecting cloned forgery; Forgery images; Fourier moments; Post-processed operations; Cloning"

We present schemes that enhance the computation strength gap between the powerful computers and the adversary. The gap between the amount of information decrypted by the adversary and the information decrypted by the receiver grows with time. Based on a new defined shortest vector problem, we also propose a simplified version scheme in which only the receivers are computationally powerful. The scheme is self-stabilizing in the sense that it can establish a security level without relying on (previously distributed private keys that are part of) the state.

In this work, we propose a hardwareassisted architecture to perform online malware detection with two phases. In the offline phase, we learn the attack model of malware in the form of Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). During the runtime phase, we implement a DFA-based detection approach in hardware to check whether a program's execution contains the malicious behavior specified in the DFA. We evaluate our method using real world data of 168 Linux malware samples and 370 benign applications. The results show that our DFA-based approach can recognize malware variants of same family with the potential to detect zero-day attacks. Implemented in hardware, our architecture offers a real time detection with low performance and resource overhead, and more importantly, it cannot be bypassed by malware using sophisticated evasion techniques. © 2016 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Computer operating systems; Hardware; Reconfigurable hardware; Attack behavior; Detection approach; Deterministic finite automata; Hardware-assisted; Malicious behavior; Malware detection; Real-time detection; Zero day attack; Malware"

In light of recent developments in information security, there is reason to be concerned that medical implants are vulnerable to attack. The ability of attackers to exert malicious control over brain implants (""brainjacking"") has unique challenges that we address in this review, with particular focus on deep brain stimulation implants. To illustrate the potential severity of this risk, we identify several mechanisms through which attackers could manipulate patients if unauthorized access to an implant can be achieved. These include blind attacks in which the attacker requires no patient-specific knowledge and targeted attacks that require patient-specific information. Blind attacks include cessation of stimulation, draining implant batteries, inducing tissue damage, and information theft. Targeted attacks include impairment of motor function, alteration of impulse control, modification of emotions or affect, induction of pain, and modulation of the reward system. We also discuss the limitations inherent in designing implants and the trade-offs that must be made to balance device security with battery life and practicality. We conclude that researchers, clinicians, manufacturers, and regulatory bodies should cooperate to minimize the risk posed by brainjacking. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Brainjacking; Cybersecurity; Deep brain stimulation; Hacking; Implantable medical device; Implantable pulse generator; Medical device security; Neurosecurity; Neurosurgery","Brain Injuries; Computer Security; Deep Brain Stimulation; Equipment Failure; Equipment Safety; Humans; Patient Safety; Prostheses and Implants; brain depth stimulation; brainjacking; emotion; human; human activities; implantable neurostimulator; impulse control disorder; knowledge; motor dysfunction; neuromodulation; pain; patient information; prosthesis design; Review; reward; surgical risk; tissue injury; adverse effects; brain depth stimulation; Brain Injuries; computer security; device failure; device safety; devices; patient safety; procedures; prostheses and orthoses"

It is an unlawful activity which uses a group of social engineering and technology to collect an Internet user's sensitive information. The identification of phishing techniques can be performed in various methods of communications like email, instant messages, pop-up messages, or at web page level. Over the period, a number of research articles have published with different techniques and procedures but have failed to detect all associated risks and provide a comprehensive solution. This paper presents a theoretical model of CRI to study this threat in a systematic manner. While there is a common perception about the successful phishing attack involves creating an identical messages or website to deceive the internet user however this theory has not been utilized to evaluate this threat and investigate the gaps systematically. Our model attempts to evaluate this crime, review different research perspectives and approaches and investigate the gaps.

Despite information security awareness and training programmes, the human aspect of information security remains a critical and challenging component of a safe and secure information environment, and users reveal personal and confidential information regularly when asked for it. In an effort to explain and understand this so-called privacy paradox, this paper investigates aspects of trust and perceptual differences, based on empirical research. Two preceding social engineering exercises form the basis of the research project and are also presented as background information. Following the empirical work, a safe and secure information model is proposed. It is then argued that perceptual alignment of different organisational groups is a critical and prerequisite requirement to reach information security congruence between groups of people. In the context of the proposed model, the perceptual differences also offer some explanation as to why users with high levels of security awareness as well as high levels of trust in own and organisational capabilities so often fall victim to social engineering scams.

Many organizations failed to comply with the standard, and this eventually results in fines or even termination of the ability to process credit cards. Clearly, an evaluation mechanism or tool used to measure the current state of the organization's information security is needed. In this paper, an Information Security Maturity Model for PCI DSS (ISMM-PCI) with four maturity level - None, Initial, Basic and Capable - was proposed. The ISMM-PCI utilizes the use of quantitative and qualitative analysis, enhancing the PCI DSS to ISO/IEC 27001 mapping, and focuses on improving the quality of people, process and technology. The model assists the organizations to easily identify the key success factors and gaps (point of weaknesses), provides the guideline to better manage information security and formulate the best strategy for the enhancement, improving the overall information security state by selecting the best security countermeasures (controls) to protect their information assets from the emerging cyber-attacks, while achieving PCI DSS full compliant. The main advantage of ISMM-PCI over other ISMMs is its ease of use. The comparative analysis of the case results affirms the statement.

Emerging threats create the need for a well-established capacity for responding to unwanted incidents. Such a capacity is influenced by organizational, human, and technological factors. We have conducted extensive fieldwork for 2.5 years in Norwegian electric power companies with the aim of identifying challenges for improving information security incident management practices. Semi-structured interviews, document analysis, a survey and participant observations have been performed as part of this case study. We describe how training for responding to information security incidents is given low priority and that different types of personnel, such as business managers and technical personnel, have different perspectives and priorities in regard to information security. Moreover, there is a gap in how IT staff and control system staff understand information security. Furthermore, cross-functional teams need to be created to ensure a holistic view during the incident response process. To improve the capacity for responding to incidents, organizations need regular training sessions and systematic evaluations after such sessions. There is also the potential for improvement in evaluating minor incidents. A transition from an ad hoc approach to a systematic approach in training and learning requires a reorientation not only by the electric power companies but also by management.

Providing high payload capacity, high visual quality, and robustness is the main aim of data hiding algorithms. However, high visual quality and high payload capacity are inversely proportional. For this reason, we used a probabilistic method. Probabilistic method is one of the soft computing methods. In this paper, a new data hiding algorithm based on probabilistic XOR secret sharing (PXORSS) in lifting wavelet transform (LWT) domain is proposed for providing high capacity and high visual quality. Previous studies have used cover images as RGB images or multiple grayscale images. LWT is proposed to use secret-sharing-based data hiding algorithms with a single grayscale cover image. In the proposed method, we used low–high (LH), high–low (HL), and high–high (HH) high-pass filter bands as cover images, and the secret data are divided into three secret shares by using PXORSS scheme. The least distorted pieces of probabilities are embedded into the high-pass filter bands as the secret share of the host image.

The developed security measures and counter-measures have played a major role in reducing the surge of cyber-attacks. However, hackers have continued to exploit vulnerabilities due to the human element to gain access into otherwise secured systems. Risks and potential for exploits are more so in schools where the human vulnerability is enhanced by young impressionable pupils. Social engineering, the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information, is increasingly the approach of choice for hackers who exploit the human element. Social engineers bypass secured systems in schools by directing targeting and exploiting the human vulnerabilities of school's students and staff. Education through awareness campaigns are typically used in countering the threat from social engineering. Such awareness campaigns tend to however be too holistic in focus to lead to the significant and sustainable change in behaviour required to counter social engineering. This paper presents a model for designing and implementing social engineering awareness programmes aimed at fostering behaviour change in schools. It demonstrates the process of designing a social engineering awareness program to meet all types of learning styles by using different multiple communication methods. Evaluation and continuous reinforcement approaches are also presented. A pilot implementation of our proposed model for social engineering awareness programme shows a significant change in behaviour of school's teaching staff. © 2016 IEEE.","Cyber Security; Learning Continuum; Security Awareness; Social Engineering","Education computing; Engineering education; Network security; Personal computing; Teaching; Awareness campaigns; Awareness program; Counter measures; Cyber security; Learning continuum; Security awareness; Security measure; Social engineering; Technological growth; Technological infrastructure; Cybersecurity"

Various demand response schemes have been developed to improve the efficiency and economy of power utilization. Nonetheless, most existing schemes, including both market-led and system-led schemes, do not carefully take the information security into account in the DR process so that the power grid could suffer from cyber attacks (data integrity attacks, etc.). To address this issue, in this paper we proposed a resilient demand response scheme based on microgrids, which can achieve both great effectiveness of energy use and security resilience against data integrity attacks. In our scheme, the DR process considers two power distribution stages. In the intra-microgrid stage, the DR providers generate the list of possible electricity prices and schedules for power delivery. In the inter-microgrid stage, utilities select the proper electricity price and the schedule for power delivery. In this way, the damage impact of attacks on the power grid can be limited only within isolated microgrids that are compromised, while other microgrids that are not compromised can operate effectively. Our experimental results show that our scheme can not only bring better benefits to all participants, but also achieve a greater security resilience in the DR process in comparison with existing schemes. © 2016 IEEE.","Data integrity attacks; Demand response; Electricity market; Microgrid; Security resilience; Smart grid","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Direct reduction process; Electric industry; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Power markets; Security of data; Software engineering; Data integrity; Demand response; Micro grid; Security resilience; Smart grid; Smart power grids"

Even when organization has very refined processes and state of the art technology, people usually remain the weakest link in the security chain. Social engineering is the practice of obtaining confidential information or valuable assets by manipulation of legitimate users or owners. Large telecommunication companies, having large customer base and a broad collection of sensitive data, present a very interesting target for social engineering attacks. In order to identify the risks for the business, penetration testing can be used as a method for determining organizational resilience against malicious attack attempts. Usually these tests are done using technical methods, but non technical methods like social engineering can also be employed. In this paper we present a case study of a penetration test using social engineering techniques targeting a large telecommunication in Croatia.

This threat is mostly attributed to the human factor, as users tend to select passwords that are easy to remember, but are not resilient to brute force or dictionary attacks. Worse yet, when not prompted to change their passwords on a regular basis the users tend to keep their original passwords, or even default passwords set by the system. These bad practices have been addressed over the decades, with the intention to educate the users on the security risks associated with them. A case study on passwords, used by the students at a Slovenian university to access the online grading system was conducted to examine whether passwords have improved over the course of the years. The results have shown that the vast majority of students continue to use the generated default passwords. Of the rest of the students who have changed their passwords, a large percent use short, simple passwords, consisting mainly of alphabetic or numeric characters. With no specific password policies enforced, user-created passwords remain weak, showing that users are still the Achilles' heel of information security. © 2016 Croatian Society MIPRO.","","Education; Grading; Microelectronics; Security of data; Students; Achilles' heel; Bad practices; Brute force; Dictionary attack; Numeric character; Online grading; Security risks; Authentication"

Additionally, the financial and human resources available to implement security and privacy vary greatly between application domains. In domestic environments, human issues may be as important as technical issues. After surveying existing solutions for enhancing IoT security, the paper identifies key future requirements for trusted Smart Home systems. A gateway architecture is selected as the most appropriate for resource-constrained devices, and for high system availability. Two key technologies to assist system auto-management are identified. Firstly, support for system auto-configuration will enhance system security. Secondly, the automatic update of system software and firmware is needed to maintain ongoing secure system operation.","Cybersecurity; Internet of Things; Smart home","Automation; Firmware; Gateways (computer networks); Intelligent buildings; Internet; Commercial operation; Cyber security; Domestic environments; Engineering infrastructure; Gateway architecture; Internet of thing (IOT); Resourceconstrained devices; Smart homes; Internet of things"

The popularization and application of cloud computing is a great challenge and opportunity in the field of information security in recent years. It can be seen that cloud computing security is changing to a hot spot for technology and academic research in cloud computing. This paper is aim to solve the problem of Cloud Security. According to the unique properties of cloud computing security, it proposes a secure management scheme in cloud computing. This scheme is used to detect the hacker attacks, illegal operation, potential threats and other security events in time based on big data. There are three main sections in the scheme: vulnerability scan, system log collection, correlation analysis. They are simply introduced and analyzed in this paper. Vulnerability scan: regular using of Nikto, Sandcat or other security tools for the cloud system to carry out the vulnerability scanning, regular network security self-testing, and building an extremely detailed scan report. System log collection: Using of Splunk, Nagios or other tools to collect the system log, also building a detailed log report. Correlation analysis: through the correlation analysis or canonical correlation analysis is used on the system log reports and vulnerability scanning reports, the attacker's attack will be found and the system will be issued a warning in time. At last, the scheme was built in the company's test environment, then the test environment was attacked by penetration test which is to simulate the act of hacking, the feasibility and function of it are verified by the testing. © 2016 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Cloud security; Correlation analysis; Secure Management Scheme; Vulnerability scan","Big data; Cloud computing; Correlation methods; Personal computing; Security of data; Academic research; Canonical correlation analysis; Cloud computing securities; Cloud securities; Correlation analysis; Management scheme; Potential threats; Vulnerability scans; Network security"

Supported by the credibility, persuasion and motivation theories, we conducted 1) a field experiment, demonstrating how sensitive organizational data can be exploited, followed by 2) a qualitative study of employees engaged in SNSs activities; and 3) interviews with Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs). Our research has resulted in four main findings: 1) employees are easily deceived and susceptible to victimization on SNSs where contextual elements provide psychological triggers to attackers; 2) organizations lack mechanisms to control SNS online security threats, 3) companies need to strengthen their information security policies related to SNSs, where stronger employee identification and authentication is needed, and 4) SNSs have become important security holes where, with the use of social engineering techniques, malicious attacks are easily facilitated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of technical safeguards, users make many critical security decisions. An example is users' responses to security messages - discrete communication designed to persuade users to either impair or improve their security status. Research shows that although users are highly susceptible to malicious messages (e.g., phishing attacks), they are highly resistant to protective messages such as security warnings. Research is therefore needed to better understand how users perceive and respond to security messages. In this article, we argue for the potential of NeuroIS - cognitive neuroscience applied to Information Systems - to shed new light on users' reception of security messages in the areas of (1) habituation, (2) stress, (3) fear, and (4) dual-task interference. We present an illustrative study that shows the value of using NeuroIS to investigate one of our research questions. This example uses eye tracking to gain unique insight into how habituation occurs when people repeatedly view security messages, allowing us to design more effective security messages. Our results indicate that the eye movement-based memory (EMM) effect is a cause of habituation to security messages - a phenomenon in which people unconsciously scrutinize stimuli that they have previously seen less than other stimuli. We show that after only a few exposures to a warning, this neural aspect of habituation sets in rapidly, and continues with further repetitions. We also created a polymorphic warning that continually updates its appearance and found that it is effective in substantially reducing the rate of habituation as measured by the EMM effect.

Based on this, a layered cloud-based information infrastructure model for next-generation power grid is proposed. Thus, this paper discussed how different categories of the power applications can benefit from the cloud-based information infrastructure. For the demonstration purpose, this paper develops three specific cloud-enabled power applications. The first two applications demonstrate how to develop practical compute-intensive and data-intensive power applications by utilizing different layered services provided by the state-of-The-Art public cloud computing platforms. In the third application, we propose a cloud-based collaborative direct load control framework in a smart grid and show the merits of the cloud-based information infrastructure on it.

However, comprehensive monitoring of DNS traffic has been often overlooked in many organizations' cybersecurity strategies. As such, DNS provides a highly attractive channel for advanced threat actors and botnet operators to establish hard-to-block and stealthy communication channels between infected devices and command-and-control (CC) infrastructures. Fast-fluxing (FF) and domain name generation algorithms (DGAs) are two well-known public DNS exploitation techniques to build agile CC infrastructures. The detection of FF and DGA domain names is a big data problem, as it requires analyzing millions of DNS queries and replies over extended time periods. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to perform DNS analytics and effectively detect FF and DGA domain names. More importantly, we describe how the algorithms are implemented using two big data processing models: MapReduce and Feature Collection and Correlation Engine. The algorithms and implementation proposed are iterative and scale over long analysis periods.

For most of the students, it is very difficult to see the connection between topics covered in the lectures or in the course. Thus, there is an urgent need for focusing student attention towards the fundamental or core ideas related to the topic under discussion as take away points. We implement a teaching approach with ""thought bubbles"", commonly used in arts and cartoons, to present core ideas to students as discussion questions. ""Thought bubbles"" (aka clouds) are used to pose as introductory questions for initiating lecture/discussion and as concluding thoughts. This approach helps student to be attentive and to grasp what will be covered during the session and again summarize all concepts at the end. There are following benefits of using the proposed approach: a) The proposed approach helps students to prioritize the information and develop critical thinking skills; b) The proposed approach helps student to get a chance to see a clear picture of essential concept and content relevant to the topic as questions through ""thought bubbles"" posed at the start of each lecture session and revisiting them at the end of the session; and c) The proposed approach helps students to be motivated around key concepts and use that knowledge to connect the dots. This ""thought bubbles"" based teaching approach requires students to use critical thinking skill and communication skill while discussing the implications and interconnections between key terms and concepts linked to a topic. In this paper, we present a case study based on the ""thought bubbles"" approach for 'Cybersecurity (for Networked Systems)' and 'Program Design for Engineers' courses. Note that the proposed approach can be implemented in any other courses in a straightforward manner.

These images may carry secret information. So, it became necessary to have an effective encryption system to hide information inside these images. The use of random and large-sized key represents the main factors that give the encryption system the required strength and give encrypted data more protection. This paper presents a non-traditional encryption algorithm that uses a large key size (256 bytes) = 2048 bits, to achieve a high degree of protection for the image. First, the algorithm represents the source image as a set of two-dimensional blocks of size 16 × 16 bytes and the secret key as a two-dimensional block of size 16 × 16 bytes. Second, transposition and substitution operations are implemented within each block of the image based on the extracted map of overlapped paths from the secret key block. Successive different keys are generated by using another way of implementation of the substitution and transposition operations in the secret key block. The recorded performance results, from the evaluation tests, have been compared with some well-known encryption algorithms and they proved that the proposed algorithm can be used effectively to protect images. © EDP Sciences 2016.","Hexadecimal; Information security; Substitution; Transposition; XOR","Image processing; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Security of data; Substitution reactions; Degree of protection; Encryption algorithms; Encryption system; Hexadecimal; Image encryption algorithm; Non-traditional; Secret information; Transposition; Cryptography"

This paper aims to provide empirical evidence to support a deeper consideration for the seemingly intangible collaborative practices that situational awareness in cybersecurity relies on and add to our understanding of what it means to do threat intelligence. In particular, it aims to unpack the informal forms of collaboration and coordination at work that build tacit knowledge about threat actors and defenders and that span across time, people and tools to inform the translation of threat information into actionable threat intelligence. In-depth semi-structured interviews and diary studies are conducted at three cyber threat intelligence service providers (N=5) and analyzed using thematic analysis. This paper introduces the concept of Threat and Defence Knowledge, tacit knowledge that analysts within an organization form over time and utilize through informal ways of becoming aware of this knowledge, making it available and correlating it. We find that a lack of accessibility to knowledge about relevant threat and defence factors can reduce analysts' effectiveness at arriving at actionable threat intelligence and hence reduce the ability to be alerted in advance about cyber threats, to contain damage and obtain situational awareness.

Furthermore, it examines to what extent organizational design buffers security risks. Using data from a 2010 national survey of local government managers, this article empirically tests the proposed model in the context of U.S. local government's online media use. Findings show that, in addition to technical complexity, organizational and environmental complexities are negatively associated with local managers' awareness of and confidence in electronic information security. On the other hand, internal security policy and decentralized decision-making appear to buffer security risks and enhance perceived information security.

However, much of the industry information regarding Social Engineering are anecdotal, making it difficult to teach industry professionals proper defense mechanisms and policies. If the cybersecurity industry is going to protect against Social Engineering attacks, proper in-depth education on the subject needs to be available to those within the field.

One way companies can reduce their risk is to build fine-grained perimeters to protect critical assets. To achieve this vision, all assets need to be assigned a sensitivity value that properly indicates their business value and criticality to the organization. Existing classification schemes based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability are not sufficient. To address this need, we have developed Enterprise Information Security Management (EISM), which aims to semi-automatically measure the sensitivity levels of enterprise assets including both data and non-data assets. For the assets for which we can access the data content, we measure the sensitivity of an asset based on the sensitivity of the data by applying content analysis and data classification technologies. For the assets for which we cannot access data content, we score and rank the assets using external information such as the attributes of users and their usage patterns. We have piloted our solutions with a number of real-world cases, including the scanning of employees' laptops, classification of business documents, and sensitivity ranking of servers without relying on data content. The experiments showed promising results, confirming that highly accurate and scalable automatic sensitivity estimation is feasible. © 1957-2012 IBM.","","Information retrieval systems; Security of data; Automatic sensitivity; Business documents; Classification scheme; Data classification; External informations; Information security managements; Perimeter protection; Sensitivity estimation; Classification (of information)"

Unpredictability and reliability are the core requirements of PUFs: unpredictability implies that an adversary cannot sufficiently predict future responses from previous observations. Reliability is important as it increases the reproducibility of PUF responses and hence allows validation of expected responses. However, advanced machine-learning algorithms have been shown to be a significant threat to the practical validity of PUFs, as they are able to accurately model PUF behavior. The most effective technique was shown to be the XOR-based combination of multiple PUFs, but as this approach drastically reduces reliability, it does not scale well against software-based machine-learning attacks. In this paper, we analyze threats to PUF security and propose PolyPUF, a scalable and secure architecture to introduce polymorphic PUF behavior. This architecture significantly increases model-building resistivity while maintaining reliability. An extensive experimental evaluation and comparison demonstrate that the PolyPUF architecture can secure various PUF configurations and is the only evaluated approach to withstand highly complex neural network machine-learning attacks. Furthermore, we show that PolyPUF consumes less energy and has less implementation overhead in comparison to lightweight reference architectures. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Information security; machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Hardware security; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network architecture; Security of data; Software reliability; Challenge response; Complex neural networks; Experimental evaluation; Future response; Physically unclonable functions; Reference architecture; Reproducibilities; Secure architectures; Cryptography"

Ransomware is intended to damage or disable a user’s computer unless the user makes a payment. Once the attack has been launched, users have three options: 1) try to restore their data from backup; 2) pay the ransom; or 3) lose their data. In this manuscript, we discuss a socio-technical approach to address ransomware and outline four overarching steps that organizations can undertake to secure an electronic health record (EHR) system and the underlying computing infrastructure. First, health IT professionals need to ensure adequate system protection by correctly installing and configuring computers and networks that connect them. Next, the health care organizations need to ensure more reliable system defense by implementing user-focused strategies, including simulation and training on correct and complete use of computers and network applications. Concomitantly, the organization needs to monitor computer and application use continuously in an effort to detect suspicious activities and identify and address security problems before they cause harm. Finally, organizations need to respond adequately to and recover quickly from ransomware attacks and take actions to prevent them in future. We also elaborate on recommendations from other authoritative sources, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Similar to approaches to address other complex socio-technical health IT challenges, the responsibility of preventing, mitigating, and recovering from these attacks is shared between health IT professionals and end-users. © Schattauer 2016.","Cybersecurity; Electronic health record; Health information technology; Ransomware; Socio-technical","Computer Communication Networks; Computer Security; Delivery of Health Care; Electronic Health Records; computer network; computer security; electronic health record; health care delivery"

So far, we have designed an Android application software system for a student to learn and understand mobile security. The new client-server mobile security system was developed to identify a person's voice, and store the spoken password in a cloud server, disallowing another user or malware to access the device. Upon unauthorized access, an email will be received very quickly through Java Mail service. The user interface has to be popped out in order to take a picture. Based on this open source platform, students can use their creative ideas to implement their own system or improve it. Based on pre-evaluations and post-evaluations on the four courses, we received positive feedback from students. Almost all the students have their own mobile devices and feel comfortable working with them. The newly developed mobile security system on Android and Java made the students easily learn how mobile security systems work via several hands-on exercises. In the Operating Systems class, many students also did research projects related to mobile security, and gave class presentations to share their research results in the class. Most students agree that the labware on mobile security can help them learn faster and better. In the future, we plan to design more security hands-on labware to teach security and introduce them into more courses in our curriculum. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.","Android; Cloud server; Distributed system; Evaluation; Java mail; Labware; Location; Mobile security system; Voice recognition",""

This unique paradigm brings about new risk related issues in Cloud Computing (CC) environment. This is because it is indispensable from a customer’s aspect to establish trust with a CSP with high risk of outsourced data to be misused. Though trustworthiness and competence to estimate risk of interaction and risk for customer’s privacy were addressed in many research works, the way through which the risk of outsourced data/ file can be minimized in the presence of malicious service providers pose challenging issues. The challenging issue of handling risk in cloud environment is addressed in this work through Risk Evaluation using Nash Equilibrium-based Bi-Matrix Decision (RE-NEBMD) model. RE-NEBMD model studies the problem of ensuring security where the possible risk of outsourced data is brought to an absolute minimum in Cloud Computing in the presence of malicious CSPs. Nash Equilibrium-based Trust Evaluation model performs trust evaluation model on CSPs for outsourced data based on strategy and utility function. Next, risk evaluation is measured using Bi-Matrix Decision model on the evaluated trust and risk is measured accordingly. Extensive analytical and experimental results are presented which show minimized cost during risk analysis, computation overhead and improving true positive rate or detected threats of our proposed model. © 2005 – 2016 JATIT & LLS.

It is also an important tool for information security and data privacy, and has been widely used in digital signatures, secure multiparty computation schemes, error-correcting codes, and so on. In many existing schemes, the construction of secret sharing scheme is mostly based on the Lagrange interpolation polynomial, the secret share is selected and distributed by a dealer and can only be used once, hence a secret channel is needed to transmit the information, only one secret can be shared in one secret sharing process. In the recovery phase, the participants cannot check whether other participants provide the true secret shares. In this paper, two verifiable threshold multi-secret sharing schemes based on non-homogeneous linear recursions are proposed. In the initial phase, the secret share of each participant is selected by himself. In the distribution phase, each scheme can be divided into two cases according to k≤t and k > t, and the k multiple secrets are put in the equations of non-homogeneous linear recursions of degree t. In the verification phase, an improved verification algorithm is proposed which improves the Dehkordi-Mashhadi schemes by reducing the number of public values from 2n＋k－t＋4 to n＋k＋5. In the recovery phase, each participant just needs to provide a pseudo share instead of the secret share, which makes the reuse of secret share to be secure. The proposed schemes have the following features: verifiable, can share multiple secrets, the reuse of secret shares is possible, only public channels are needed, based on elliptic curves, and have better performance than some other typical schemes, such as less public values and reconstruction polynomial with lower degree. This makes the schemes more efficient and useful in practical applications. © 2016 Journal of Cryptologic Research.

In this reason the aim of secure access to all resources of an e-learning environment is very important and adequate technological and organizational measures for authentication, authorization and protection of personal data must be applied. Strong security procedures should be proposed to protect user's profiles, designed after successful registration and all personal information collected by educational processes. The goal of this article is to present an idea to combine traditional e-learning technologies with new opportunities that give mobile applications, cloud services and social computing. These technologies can endanger data security since they make possible remote access to resources, sharing information between participants by network communications. In order to avoid data vulnerabilities users must be identified and authenticated before, i.e. to be allowed to access information resources otherwise integrity and confidentiality of e-learning system could be destroyed. In order to propose solution basic principles of information security and privacy protection in e-learning processes are discussed in this article. As a result, an organizational scheme of a system for information security and privacy is proposed. Based on these principles a graph formalization of access to the system resources is made and architecture for combined (heterogenic) e-learning architecture with secure access to the resources is designed. Analytical investigation based on designed Markov chain has been carried out and several statistical assessments delivered by Develve software are discussed.

To solve the problems of un-unified file identification and increasement of memory's file leakage risk in information security caused by the file's use of a filter driver model to perform encryption and decryption, a new encryption and decryption model combining the hook mechanism and the filtering driver model was designed. The model uses the filter driver model to encrypt the file, and at the same time, the hook mechanism is introduced to capture the file operation behavior in memory to make the file has the same identity around the encryption and decryption. Thus under the circum stances of keeping the original operating habits of the file, a reduction on the risk of the file's recovery is achieved. The theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that the model proposed in the study can be used to fast encrypt and decrypt different files under three encryption modes, and its disintegration rate can be decreased over 3 per cent compared with the filter driver model. © 2016, Inst. of Scientific and Technical Information of China.

This work aims to automatically generate data triage automatons directly from cybersecurity analysts' operation traces. Existing methods for generating data triage automatons, including Security Information and Event Management systems (SIEMs), require event correlation rules to be generated by dedicated manual effort from expert analysts. To save analysts' workloads, we propose to 'mine' data triage rules out of cybersecurity analysts' operation traces and to use these rules to construct data triage automatons. Our approach may make the cost (of data triage automaton generation) orders of magnitudes smaller.

However, clouds may be subject to challenges arising from cyber attacks including DoS and malware, as well as from sheer complexity problems that manifest themselves as anomalies. Anomaly detection techniques are used increasingly to improve the resilience of cloud environments and indirectly reduce the cost of recovery from outages. Most anomaly detection techniques are computationally expensive in a cloud context, and often require problem-specific parameters to be predefined in advance, impairing their use in real-time detection. Aiming to overcome these problems, we propose a technique for anomaly detection based on data density. The density is computed recursively, so the technique is memory-less and unsupervised, and therefore suitable for real-time cloud environments. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique on a dataset created in our cloud testbed. The dataset consists of feature vectors obtained from a physical cloud testbed network experiencing migration under controlled traffic conditions modelling scenarios combining normal network use with network-based attacks. The obtained results, which include precision, recall, accuracy, F-score and G-score, show that network level attacks are detectable with high accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; Cloud security","Cloud computing; Cybersecurity; Malware; Network security; Testbeds; Anomaly detection; Cloud environments; Cloud securities; Cloud-computing; Cost effective; Cyber-attacks; Data density; Effective demands; Malwares; On-demand services; Cost effectiveness"

Inculcating information security culture among healthcare practitioners is identified to be one of the solutions for a better security practice. Thus, identifying the issues and factors that influence information security culture are important. A preliminary investigation involving six healthcare professionals and academics have been carried out for better understanding on the critical factors that may influence the information security culture. In-depth interview method is chosen in this study. Thematic coding was conducted to characterise the themes and asses the factor that found to be influential. Results from the indepth interviews with healthcare expertise showed that four main themes may influence the degree to which information security may be cultivated. Security behaviour, security value, security awareness, and enforcement of security policy are the themes addressed by the key informants as the influential factors inculcating information security culture. This study also found that various level of healthcare professional exhibited different outcomes in information security culture.

Password-based user authentication with key agreement protocols have drawn attentions since it provides proper authentication of a user before granting access right to services, and then ensure secure communication over insecure channels. Recently, Lee et al. pointed out different security flaws on Tsaur et al.’s multi-server user authentication protocol, and they further proposed an extended chaotic maps-based user authentication with key agreement protocol for multi-server environments. However, we observed that Lee et al.’s protocol has some functionality and security flaws, i.e., it is inefficient in detection of unauthorized login and it does not support password change mechanism. Besides, their protocol is vulnerable to registration center spoofing attack and server spoofing attack. In order to remedy the aforementioned flaws, we proposed a novel chaotic maps-based user authentication with key agreement protocol for multi-server environments. The proposed protocol is provably secure in the random oracle model under the chaotic-maps based computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. In addition, we analyzed our protocol using BAN logic model.

Security policies have been developed to ensure that data and assets remain protected for legitimate users, but there must be a mechanism to verify that these policies can be enforced. This paper addresses the verification problem of security policies in role-based access control of enterprise software. Most existing approaches employ traditional logic or procedural programming that tends to involve complex expressions or search with backtrack. These can be time-consuming, and hard to understand, and update, especially for large-scale security verification problems. Declarative programming paradigms such as “Answer Set” programming have been widely used to alleviate these issues by ways of elegant and flexible modeling for complex search problems. However, solving problems using these paradigms can be challenging due to the nature and limitation of the declarative problem solver. This paper presents an approach to automated security policy verification using Answer Set programming. In particular, we investigate how the separation of duty security policy in role-based access control can be verified. Our contribution is a modeling approach that maps this verification problem into a graph-coloring problem to facilitate the use of generate-and-test in a declarative problem-solving paradigm. The paper describes a representation model and rules that drive the Answer Set Solver and illustrates the proposed approach to securing web application software to assist the hiring process in a company. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Answer set programming; Cybersecurity; Security constraints","Access control; Digital storage; Enterprise software; Logic programming; Security systems; Verification; XML; Answer set programming; Cyber security; Declarative problem solving; Declarative Programming; Graph coloring problem; Procedural programming; Role-based Access Control; Security constraint; Problem solving"

Algorithms seldom operate on their own and their (dis)utilities are dependent on the everyday aspects of data capture, processing and utilization. However, as algorithms become increasingly autonomous and invisible, they become harder for the public to detect and scrutinize their impartiality status. Algorithms can systematically introduce inadvertent bias, reinforce historical discrimination, favor a political orientation or reinforce undesired practices. Yet it is difficult to hold algorithms accountable as they continuously evolve with technologies, systems, data and people, the ebb and flow of policy priorities, and the clashes between new and old institutional logics. Greater openness and transparency do not necessarily improve understanding.

This paper proposes a novel PUF which utilizes the nature of stochastic flash analog-To-digital (ADCs) to minimize hardware without sacrificing reliability or robustness against cloning. The proposed PUF creates a unique device identifier by employing the comparators used in a stochastic ADC, which are designed for maximum offset voltage due to device mismatch. The proposed PUF was modeled and simulated using a 130nm CMOS process. Simulation results show that the PUF has a normalized interhamming distance (uniqueness) of 48.5% and is reliable with a normalized average bit flip of 2-3% over ±10% variance in supply voltage and temperatures up to 100°C. © 2016 IEEE.","PUF; Stochastic ADC; Unique device identifier","Clone cells; Hardware security; Stochastic systems; Advancing technology; Analog-to-digital; Physically unclonable functions; Process Variation; Security features; Stochastic ADC; Stochastic approach; Unique device identifier; Cryptography"

Today, these no longer consist only of servers, mainframes and workstations, but involve a wide range of pervasive and embedded devices, leading to the concept of ubiquitous computing systems. There is, however, an important gap in the adaptation of the existent cryptanalytic methodologies and tools to this relatively new ubiquitous computing framework. Efforts to correct this gap should target four main axes: the development of new cryptographic models, further cryptanalysis of the main building blocks, progress in hardware and software security engineering, and advances in the security assessment of real-world systems. Researchers have only recently started to devote their efforts to the study of the security of ubiquitous computing systems and the necessary lightweight cryptography. Despite the critical flaws found, the required highly-specialized skills and the isolation of the involved disciplines are a true barrier for advancing and identifying additional issues. It is therefore necessary to establish a network of researchers with complementary skills so that expertise in cryptography, information security, privacy, and embedded systems can be put to work together.

With 38 attendees, student mentors and faculty prepared a series of workshops, seminars and activities designed to educate and inspire girls to consider potential career paths in cybersecurity. Due to the success of this project, we are planning a bigger and more significant event for the summer of 2016 along with a supplemental series of workshops for STEM teachers at middle and high-schools. In this paper we discuss the methods and implementation of our 2015 summer camp. We look at the perceived strengths and weaknesses of our approach to identify successful aspects and recommend improvements for the coming year. By including data from entry and exit surveys, we are able to comprehensively analyze both the perceived impact of our camp from the attendee's perspective. We also acknowledge and thank Microsoft and Facebook for their generous financial support of this effort. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.","",""

Especially, image protection is most challenging task in the field of Internet communications, media identification, tracking, health care and biomedical applications. Image scrambling is a prominent technique to shuffle all the pixels in the original image into different index positions to change the order of the pictorial arrangement. The appearance of resultant image is fully non-recognizable format to the outside viewers. This is a preliminary and final process of security related applications such as information hiding, cryptography and network security. In this paper, an efficient image scrambling technique has been proposed for medical images. A Secret image has transformed into two dimensional matrix formats and generate key file by arranging the pixel intensities sequentially. The circular fill technique is used to compute the new structure of matrix and perform the binary transformation of all index positions. Finally, we implement the LSB substitution technique to obtain the scrambled image. We have also proposed some quality metrics to measure the quality of restored image.

It has advantages of perfect information security and high efficiency in transmission. In recent years, the theoretical and experimental results show that quantum communication systems have the superiority over the traditional communication systems. Quantum communication systems are hopeful for solving the information security problems that everyone is facing today, therefore, they possess broad application prospects and are forming a research hotspot of the telecommunications field currently. On the other hand, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is the method to transmit the digitized packet voice in Internet around the world. The advantages of VoIP are that it can carry voice, data, video, telephone conference, electronic commerce, and electronic mail economically. VoIP can realize the information storage and retransmission easily and flexibly. However, VoIP also encounters the problem of information security. We are trying to combine the quantum communications network and the VoIP system together and build a brand new network named quantum VoIP network which combines the advantages of both quantum communications and VoIP. The data packets may be delayed and lost in a queue up with a router due to the congestion and link failure during the transmission of quantum information. In order to ensure the performance of quantum VoIP system, the routing optimization strategies are proposed in the paper. The relay technology based on entanglement swapping is adopted. The multiuse quantum communications are realized by giving priority to the quantum channels with the least relay nodes. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that when the data transmission links are fail to work properly and routers are in congestion, adopting the routing optimization strategies in M/M/m queuing system with the bit error rate (BER) of quantum bit setting to be 0.2 and the number of common channels increasing from 4 to 8, the percentage of call failure in quantum communication network decreases from 0.25 to 0.024, and the maximum throughput of quantum networks increases from 64 kbps to 132 kbps. In comparison, when the number of common channels is set to be 4 andthe BER of the quantum bit is from 0.3 to 0.1, the maximum throughput of quantum networks increases from 41 kbps to 140 kbps. Thus it can be concluded that the routing optimization strategies proposed in this paper can improve the performance of quantum VoIP system significantly. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.","Entanglement swapping; Least relay node; Quantum communication; Quantum VoIP","Bit error rate; Communication channels (information theory); Constrained optimization; Data communication systems; Digital storage; Internet telephony; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Routers; Routing algorithms; Security of data; Throughput; Voice/data communication systems; Analysis and simulation; Entanglement swapping; Maximum through-put; Of quantum-information; Quantum VoIP; Relay node; Routing optimization; Voice over Internet protocol; Quantum communication"

The ever-increasing cybersecurity threats faced by today’s digital systems require a strong cyber-defense mechanism that is both reactive in its response to mitigate the known risk and proactive in being prepared for handling the unknown risks. In order to be proactive for handling the unknown risks, the above workforce must be scheduled dynamically so the system is adaptive to meet the day-to-day stochastic demands on its workforce (both size and expertise mix). The stochastic demands on the workforce stem from the varying alert generation and their significance rate, which causes an uncertainty for the cybersecurity analyst scheduler that is attempting to schedule analysts for work and allocate sensors to analysts. Sensor data are analyzed by automatic processing systems, and alerts are generated. A portion of these alerts is categorized to be significant, which requires thorough examination by a cybersecurity analyst. Risk, in this article, is defined as the percentage of significant alerts that are not thoroughly analyzed by analysts. In order to minimize risk, it is imperative that the cyber-defense system accurately estimates the future significant alert generation rate and dynamically schedules its workforce to meet the stochastic workload demand to analyze them. The article presents a reinforcement learning-based stochastic dynamic programming optimization model that incorporates the above estimates of future alert rates and responds by dynamically scheduling cybersecurity analysts to minimize risk (i.e., maximize significant alert coverage by analysts) and maintain the risk under a pre-determined upper bound. The article tests the dynamic optimization model and compares the results to an integer programming model that optimizes the static staffing needs based on a daily-average alert generation rate with no estimation of future alert rates (static workforce model). Results indicate that over a finite planning horizon, the learning-based optimization model, through a dynamic (on-call) workforce in addition to the static workforce, (a) is capable of balancing risk between days and reducing overall risk better than the static model, (b) is scalable and capable of identifying the quantity and the right mix of analyst expertise in an organization, and (c) is able to determine their dynamic (on-call) schedule and their sensor-to-analyst allocation in order to maintain risk below a given upper bound. Several meta-principles are presented, which are derived from the optimization model, and they further serve as guiding principles for hiring and scheduling cybersecurity analysts. Days-off scheduling was performed to determine analyst weekly work schedules that met the cybersecurity system’s workforce constraints and requirements. © 2016 ACM.","","Adaptive systems; Dynamic programming; Dynamics; Integer programming; Learning systems; Network security; Personnel; Personnel selection; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Automatic processing system; Dynamic optimization models; Finite planning horizon; Guiding principles; Integer programming models; Optimal assignment; Optimization modeling; Stochastic dynamic programming; Occupational risks"

We prove a multi-letter capacity formula for this model. We prove that, if enough common randomness is used, the capacity formula can be given a single-shot form again. We then consider the opposite extremal case, where no common randomness is available, and derive the capacity. It is known that the capacity of the system can be discontinuous under these circumstances. We prove here that it is still stable in the sense that it is continuous around its positivity points. We further prove that discontinuities can only arise if the legal link is symmetrizable and characterize the points where it is positive. These results shed new light on the design principles of communication systems with embedded security features. At last, we investigate the effect of super-activation of the message transmission capacity of AVWCs under the average error criterion. We give a complete characterization of those AVWCs that may be super-activated. The effect is thereby also related to the (conjectured) super-activation of the common randomness assisted capacity of AVWCs with an eavesdropper that gets to know the common randomness.

As an important component of industry systems, information system (IS) plays a vital role in business processes. However, data and information may leak in business processes. The damages caused by information security breaches (ISBs) on firms are increasing in recent years. Previous studies have consistently found that the announcements of ISBs are negatively associated with the market values of the announcing firms during the days surrounding the breach announcements. Globalization drives firms in diverse industries to cross-list their stocks. With the benefits of cross-listing, firms are able to perform entrepreneurship and industry integration is improved as well. Because cross-listing improves information environments and provides better investor protection, this paper argues that cross-listing help firms to reduce the negative impacts caused by their announcements of ISBs. From the perspective of ISs engineering, this paper conducts an event study of 120 publicly traded firms and finds that cross-listing does not mitigate the impact of ISB announcements on a firm's stock prices. © World Scientific Publishing Co.","Business processes; Cross-listing; Firm value; Industry integration; Information security breaches; Information system engineering",""

We refer to this as the cyber security investment challenge.In this paper, we consider three possible decision support methodologies for security managers to tackle this challenge. We consider methods based on game theory, combinatorial optimisation, and a hybrid of the two. Our modelling starts by building a framework where we can investigate the effectiveness of a cyber security control regarding the protection of different assets seen as targets in presence of commodity threats. As game theory captures the interaction between the endogenous organisation's and attackers' decisions, we consider a 2-person control game between the security manager who has to choose among different implementation levels of a cyber security control, and a commodity attacker who chooses among different targets to attack. The pure game theoretical methodology consists of a large game including all controls and all threats. In the hybrid methodology the game solutions of individual control-games along with their direct costs (e.g. financial) are combined with a Knapsack algorithm to derive an optimal investment strategy. The combinatorial optimisation technique consists of a multi-objective multiple choice Knapsack based strategy. To compare these approaches we built a decision support tool and a case study regarding current government guidelines. The endeavour of this work is to highlight the weaknesses and strengths of different investment methodologies for cyber security, the benefit of their interaction, and the impact that indirect costs have on cyber security investment. Going a step further in validating our work, we have shown that our decision support tool provides the same advice with the one advocated by the UK government with regard to the requirements for basic technical protection from cyber attacks in SMEs. © 2016 The Authors.

Despite their benefits in various areas such as marketing, business and medical analysis, the use of data mining techniques can also result in new threats to privacy and information security. Therefore, a new class of data mining methods called privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) has been developed. The aim of researches in this field is to develop techniques those could be applied to databases without violating the privacy of individuals. In this work we introduce a new approach to preserve sensitive information in databases with both numerical and categorical attributes using fuzzy logic. We map a database into a new one that conceals private information while preserving mining benefits. In our proposed method, we use fuzzy membership functions (MFs) such as Gaussian, P-shaped, Sigmoid, S-shaped and Z-shaped for private data. Then we cluster modified datasets by Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Our experimental results show that using fuzzy logic for preserving data privacy guarantees valid data clustering results while protecting sensitive information. The accuracy of the clustering algorithm using fuzzy data is approximately equivalent to original data and is better than the state of the art methods in this field.","Clustering; Data mining; Expectation maximization algorithm; Privacy preserving",""

A promising step toward conquering this challenge is to formally verify that the end-to-end behavior of the computing system really satisfies various information-flow policies. Unfortunately, because today's system software still consists of both C and assembly programs, the end-to-end verification necessarily requires that we not only prove the security properties of individual components, but also carefully preserve these properties through compilation and cross-language linking. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for formally verifying end-to-end security of a software system that consists of both C and assembly programs. We introduce a general definition of observation function that unifies the concepts of policy specification, state indistinguishability, and whole-execution behaviors. We show how to use different observation functions for different levels of abstraction, and how to link different security proofs across abstraction levels using a special kind of simulation that is guaranteed to preserve state indistinguishability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our new methodology, we have successfully constructed an end-to-end security proof, fully formalized in the Coq proof assistant, of a nontrivial operating system kernel (running on an extended CompCert x86 assembly machine model). Some parts of the kernel are written in C and some are written in assembly; we verify all of the code, regardless of language. © 2016 ACM.","Certified os kernels; Information flow control; Program verification; Security policy specification; Security-preserving simulation","Abstracting; Assembly machines; Computational linguistics; Computer programming languages; Computer software; Security of data; Specifications; Theorem proving; Verification; Certified os kernels; Information flow control; Program Verification; Security policy; Security-preserving simulation; C (programming language)"

To alleviate consumer anxiety about the loss of sensitive information, and to further increase consumer demand, firms usually integrate their information security investment strategies to capture market share from competitors and their security information sharing strategies to increase consumer demand across all member firms in industry-based information sharing centers. Using differential game theory, this article investigates dynamic strategies for security investment and information sharing for two competing firms under targeted attacks, in which both firms can influence the value of their information assets through the endogenous determination of pricing rates. We analytically and numerically examine how both security investment rates and information sharing rates are affected by several key parameters in a non-cooperative scenario, including the efficiency of security investment rates, sensitivity parameters for pricing rates, coefficients of consumer demand losses, and the density of targeted attacks. Our results reveal that, confronted with a higher coefficient of consumer demand loss and a higher density of targeted attacks, both firms are reluctant to aggressively defend against hackers and would rather decrease the negative effect of hacker attacks by lowering their pricing rates. Also, we derive feedback equilibrium solutions for the situation where both firms cooperate in security investment, information sharing, or both. It is revealed that although a higher hacker attack density always decreases a firm's integral profits, both firms are not always willing to cooperate in security investment and information sharing. Specifically, the superior firm benefits most when both firms fully cooperate and benefits the least when they behave fully non-cooperatively. However, the inferior firm enjoys the highest integral profit when both firms only cooperate in information sharing and the lowest integral profit in the completely cooperative situation. © 2016 “IIE”.","Differential game; Feedback equilibrium; Information security economics; Information sharing; Pricing; Security investment","Competition; Costs; Game theory; Information analysis; Investments; Personal computing; Profitability; Security of data; Competitive environment; Differential game theory; Differential games; Information security economics; Information security investment; Information sharing; Information sharing strategies; Security investments; Information dissemination"

This has resulted in the establishment of information systems such as e-supply chains (eSCs) amongst others which integrate the internet and other information and communications technology (ICT) with traditional business processes for the swift transmission of information between trading partners. Many organisations have reaped the benefits that come from adopting the eSC model, but have also faced the challenges with which it comes. One such major challenge is information security. With the current state of cybercrime, system developers are challenged with the task of developing cutting edge digital forensic readiness (DFR) systems that can keep up with current technological advancements, such as (eSCs). Hence, the problem addressed in this paper is the lack of a well-formulated DFR approach that can assist system developers in the development of e-supply chain digital forensic readiness systems. The main objective of such a system being that it must be able to provide law enforcement/digital forensic investigators (DFI) with forensically sound and readily available potential digital evidence that can expedite and support digital forensics incident response processes. This approach, if implemented can also prepare trading partners for security incidents that might take place, if not prevent them from occurring. Therefore, the work presented in this paper is aimed at providing a procedural approach that is based on digital forensics principles. This paper discusses the limitations of current system monitoring tools in relation to the kind of specialised DFR systems that are needed in the eSC environment and proposes an eSC-DFR process model and architectural design model that can lead to the development of next-generation eSC DFR systems. It is the view of the authors that the conclusions drawn from this paper can spearhead the development of cutting-edge next-generation digital forensic readiness systems, and bring attention to some of the shortcomings of current system monitoring tools. © 2015 IEEE.","Cyber-Crime; Digital forensic data analysis tools; Digital Forensic Investigation (DFI); Digital forensic readiness (DFR); e-supply chain digital forensic (eSC-DFR) system; e-Supply Chains (eSCs); Forensics domains; Network forensics","Commerce; Computer crime; Cutting tools; Damage detection; Electronic crime countermeasures; Monitoring; Security of data; Supply chains; Cyber-crimes; E-supply chains; Forensic investigation; Forensic readiness; Information and communications technology; System developers; System monitoring tools; Technological advancement; Digital forensics"

However, these lucrative activities also bring new forms of privacy threats to the community. In a reliable e-business service, users should be able to trust the providers of the service to protect their customers' privacy. The service providers should not risk the personal and private information about their customers in cyberspace. There is an economic gain for a business provider when users trust the service provider. Despite those benefits, cyber security concern is the main reason some large organization may go bankrupted. Unfortunately, attackers may attempt to breach a provider's database and expose customers' private information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a game theoretic framework for security and trust relationship in cyberspace for users, service providers, and attackers. Mathematical proofs and evaluations support our model. Service providers may use the model to see how important and dissuasive against attackers is when investing in cybersecurity. We propose a three-player game-theoretic approach framework for security and trust relationship in cyberspace for users, service providers, and attackers. The model implemented has a positive impact on users trust relation with their service provider while introducing some dissuasive factors to an attacker with intention to breach a provider's infrastructure in case a provider invests in cybersecurity.

However, silicon chips are vulnerable to hazards such as counterfeiting, tampering and information leakage through side-channel attacks (for example, by measuring power consumption, timing or electromagnetic radiation). Single-walled carbon nanotubes are a potential replacement for silicon as the channel material of transistors due to their superb electrical properties and intrinsic ultrathin body, but problems such as limited semiconducting purity and non-ideal assembly still need to be addressed before they can deliver high-performance electronics. Here, we show that by using these inherent imperfections, an unclonable electronic random structure can be constructed at low cost from carbon nanotubes. The nanotubes are self-Assembled into patterned HfO 2 trenches using ion-exchange chemistry, and the width of the trench is optimized to maximize the randomness of the nanotube placement. With this approach, two-dimensional (2D) random bit arrays are created that can offer ternary-bit architecture by determining the connection yield and switching type of the nanotube devices. As a result, our cryptographic keys provide a significantly higher level of security than conventional binary-bit architecture with the same key size. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

How to identify the credible degree of the user identity and behavior becomes the core problem? This paper proposes a user abnormal behavior analysis method based on neural network clustering to resolve the problems of over-fitting and flooding the feature information, which exists in the process of traditional clustering analysis and calculating similarity. Firstly, singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to reduce dimension and de-noise for massive data, where map-reduce parallel processing is used to accelerate the computation speed, and neural network model is used for softening points. Secondly, information entropy is added to hidden layer of neural network model to calculate the weight of each attribute. Finally, weight factor is used to calculate the similarity to make the cluster more accuracy. For the problem of analyzing the mobile cloud user behaviors, the experimental results show that the scheme has higher detection speed (DS) and clustering accuracy than traditional schemes. The proposed method is more suitable for the mobile cloud environment. © 2016 The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications","anomaly analysis; information entropy; information security; neural network; singular value decomposition (SVD)","Behavioral research; Network layers; Network security; Neural networks; Security of data; Anomaly analysis; Calculating similarities; Feature information; Information entropy; Neural network clustering; Neural network model; Parallel processing; Traditional clustering; Singular value decomposition"

Although there are different methods to design these functions, in recent years chaos theory has emerged as a strong solution in this area. Chaotic hash functions use one-dimensional maps such as logistic and tent, or employ complex multi-dimensional maps which are typically insecure or slow and most of them has been successfully attacked. In this paper, we propose a new chaotic system and employ it to design a secure and fast hash function. The improved security factor has roots in the hyper sensitivity of the proposed chaotic map while properties like speed and security can be parameterized. On the other hand, the proposed hash function has a dynamic random array of functions and can be implemented by a parallel architecture. This data-level parallel architecture makes it fast to generate the hash value. Statistical simulations show success of the proposed hashing scheme. Cryptanalysis of proposed function, such as key sensitivity, meet-in-the-middle attack, collision, preimage resistance and high level attacks, proves security of the proposed function. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There are three main traditional access control models in the past-discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC) and role-based access control (RBAC). But these models can only assign rights according to the existing access control policy, which is stoical and reactive. To make access control more proactive, some experts propose some access control models based on game theory. But complex calculations when subjects make access requests will affect the access performance and reduce the access efficiency. To solve these problems, we propose an access control model based on stochastic game in this paper. At first, we introduce a strategy selection problem of object mathematically in this model, and then describe the model in detail on how to solve this problem. We also prove the existence of Nash equilibrium in the model. At last, we make an experiment to show the advantages of this model.

Even though the effectiveness of security measures to protect sensitive information is increasing, people remain susceptible to manipulation and thus the human element remains a weak link. A social engineering attack targets this weakness by using various manipulation techniques to elicit sensitive information. The field of social engineering is still in its early stages with regard to formal definitions, attack frameworks and templates of attacks. This paper proposes detailed social engineering attack templates that are derived from real-world social engineering examples. Current documented examples of social engineering attacks do not include all the attack steps and phases. The proposed social engineering attack templates attempt to alleviate the problem of limited documented literature on social engineering attacks by mapping the real-world examples to the social engineering attack framework. Mapping several similar real-world examples to the social engineering attack framework allows one to establish a detailed flow of the attack whilst abstracting subjects and objects. This mapping is then utilised to propose the generalised social engineering attack templates that are representative of real-world examples, whilst still being general enough to encompass several different real-world examples. The proposed social engineering attack templates cover all three types of communication, namely bidirectional communication, unidirectional communication and indirect communication. In order to perform comparative studies of different social engineering models, processes and frameworks, it is necessary to have a formalised set of social engineering attack scenarios that are fully detailed in every phase and step of the process. The social engineering attack templates are converted to social engineering attack scenarios by populating the template with both subjects and objects from real-world examples whilst still maintaining the detailed flow of the attack as provided in the template. Furthermore, this paper illustrates how the social engineering attack scenarios are applied to verify a social engineering attack detection model. These templates and scenarios can be used by other researchers to either expand on, use for comparative measures, create additional examples or evaluate models for completeness. Additionally, the proposed social engineering attack templates can also be used to develop social engineering awareness material. © 2016, Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, our objective is to introduce ORGODEX, a new model and practical methodology for engineering scalable RBAC systems in large organizations where employees require access to information on a need to know basis. First, we motivate the requirement for a new RBAC dichotomy, distinguishing between roles and respon-sibilities. Next, we introduce our new model for describ-ing and reasoning about RBAC systems with this new di-chotomy. Finally, we produce a new iterative methodology for engineering scalable access control systems. © 2016 ACM.","Complexity; Least privilege; Organizational structure; Role-based access control; Scala-bility","Control systems; Iterative methods; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Complexity; Iterative methodology; Large organizations; Least privilege; Organizational structures; Role-based Access Control; Wrong answers; Access control"

However, excessive focus on the mere reinforcement of information security has placed employees under stress. Studies have confirmed that the negative effects of stress include reduced employee productivity. Therefore, it is important to manage employee stress while enforcing information security in an organization. Based on person-environment fit theory, this study examines how employees become stressed, the factors behind information security stress (ISS), and the differences between managerial and technical security-oriented organizations. The results show that work overload and invasion of privacy are information security stressors. Furthermore, work overload has a greater effect on ISS in managerial security-oriented organizations, while invasion of privacy exerts a greater influence on ISS in technical security-oriented organizations. In addition, attitude to compliance with the information security policy mitigates work overload and invasion of privacy. These findings can be used as a basic reference for the establishment of employee stress management measures and the evaluation of information security stress levels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, public administration uses these smart city data to increase its efficiency, to reduce costs and to provide additional services. However, the information received at smart city data centers is not always accurate, because WSNs are sometimes prone to error and are exposed to physical and computer attacks. In this article, we use real data from the smart city of Barcelona to simulate WSNs and implement typical attacks. Then, we compare frequently used anomaly detection techniques to disclose these attacks. We evaluate the algorithms under different requirements on the available network status information. As a result of this study, we conclude that one-class Support Vector Machines is the most appropriate technique.

These social changes enabled us to obtain information related to health more efficiently. Modern society is rapidly aging and more people experience chronic diseases because of their wrong eating habit, obesity and insufficient exercise. Thus a demand for health improvement and management at a certain term is increasing rather than complete therapy. Previously, major medical institutions managed personal medical history regarding patients mainly in health management but it is not changing its method to self-utilization and management by individual patient as of now along with medical institutions as fusion technology develops, and individual health record information can easily be checked anywhere, anytime through personal health record (PHR) platform. Unlike developing speed of related technology, however, there is a limitation in expansion, development of individual health record service, personal information security currently. In this paper, we propose mobile service regarding life style improvement targeting high risk chronic diseases based on PHR platform. PHR platform determines high blood pressure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia diseases which are three main chronic diseases using users’ data and can monitor chronic diseases in portable mobile device. Also, the service provides by organically, mutually connected form through feedback towards input from health states of users in mobile device. By proposing contents about service based on efficient individual health record through mobile device that maximized transportability based on PHR platform, proposed method will contribute to industry development and activation of application service development of individual health record. Increase in consistency and reliability through standardization of afterwards health management service is expected to contribute to reduction in social cost and improvement of national health being the basis to realize communication activation of health record between medical institutions, efficient management and education of patients, reduction in dual examinations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Chronic diseases; Elderly; IT convergence; Mobile application; PHR platform; U-Healthcare","Biomedical engineering; Blood pressure; Chemical activation; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Security of data; Wireless telecommunication systems; Chronic disease; Elderly; IT convergence; Mobile applications; PHR platform; u-Healthcare; Diseases"

Specifically, this paper describes an approach to ""self-authenticate"" software so that it is robust in detecting attempts to defeat security safeguards that are programmed into the compiled software code. Self-authentication relies on encrypting certain critical functions of the software so that decryption of those portions is necessary for proper operation of the device.

Within these integrated relationships between internal and external parties in the supply chain, knowledge and information have become very important production resources. The existence and success of an increasing number of organizations strongly depend on their capabilities to utilize knowledge and information for profit generation. By managing more efficient information sharing, the volume of company confidential information passing through the supply chain increases, and this brings about more incidences of knowledge leakage and information leakage. A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2014 shows information security spending over the next 12 months would increase 60.27 % in Asia and 48.98 % in all regions. This emphasizes the importance of information privacy and therefore the necessity to study the information and knowledge leakage in integrated supply chain. The objectives of this study are to investigate the factors triggering information and knowledge leakage and create a mitigation framework to soften the impact of leakages on performance. The above objectives will be met by formulating and examining several hypotheses of a conceptualized information leakage (IL) and knowledge leakage (KL) framework. A case study derived from a structured interview is adopted as a methodology in this research. As a result, this paper contributes a novel theoretical model that characterizes information and knowledge leakage in an integrated supply chain. Therefore, it also adds new knowledge of managing information and knowledge leakage to supply chain management. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Information; Knowledge leakage; Supply chain management","Chains; Security of data; Confidential information; Information; Information sharing; Integrated supply chain; Internal operations; PricewaterhouseCoopers; Production resources; Theoretical modeling; Supply chain management"

However, an effective national cybersecurity strategy conforms to international standards serves to preserve organization's information assets. The standard is to support a cybersecurity consistent approach including legal, technological and organizational dimensions, as more cybersecurity is mainly based on technology, management procedure, organizational structure, laws and human competence. The promise of this research program is to identify the key areas for an effective cybersecurity strategy addressed to any organization (Administration or enterprise) which will be adapted according to the internal context - taking into account successful experiences in this context - in order to develop a favorable recommended framework for cybersecurity strategy implementation that ensures an acceptable information security level. © 2015 IEEE.","cybersecurity; information; legal; organizational; strategy; technological","Intelligent systems; Security of data; Systems analysis; Cyber security; information; legal; organizational; strategy; technological; National security"

We discovered that students do not use their mobile devices just for private purposes but also for work related tasks; furthermore, they use their private mobile devices to access various information systems and corporate data that can be classified, or marked as trade secrets, personal data or professional secrecy. Individuals who are granted authorised access to these types of data are obliged to protect them from unauthorised access and cyber threats. In our survey, we tried to find out how well students were aware of the existing information security threats to mobile devices and to the data which they access through mobile devices.

Because the user of a mobile device can be held criminally responsible for the loss of data that he or she had accessed by using the mobile device, even though he or she is not aware of security threats and protective measures against them, we believe that it will be necessary to encourage users to educate themselves about the new cyber threats that are typically targeting mobile devices, and also to familiarise themselves with the methods of protecting their mobile devices. To this purpose, organisations should implement internal regulations and continuously educate mobile device users about their safe usage in accordance with organisational standards. © 2016 Blaž Markelj.","Awareness; Criminal responsibility; Cyber threats; Guilt; Mobile devices","Crime; Data privacy; Laws and legislation; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Security of data; Security systems; Students; Surveys; Awareness; Criminal responsibility; Cyber threats; Guilt; Information security threats; Mobile device users; Protective measures; Student populations; Mobile devices"

Furthermore, this approach is generally regarded as ineffective against attacks like code polymorphism and metamorphism used by malware writers to obfuscate their code. To overcome this problem new techniques have been developed using data mining and machine learning.

Information was collected about the number of ISO standard certification documents that Turkish organizations received in respect of these standards between the period of 2007 and 2013. For the same period, information about the number of granted patents, petty patents, trademarks and industrial designs in Turkey were also collected. The information was analyzed by year, industrial property right type and ISO standard. A Spearman correlation analysis was also conducted to determine the strength of association between the number of certification documents and the number of granted industrial property rights. The analysis showed that some of the ISO standards had either a positive or negative linear relationship with one or more of the granted industrial property right types. Although the total number of certification documents had decreased over the time period of the study, the number of granted industrial property rights in Turkey had increased over the same period indicating that the adoption of quality managment system standards may have led to an increase in national innovation in Turkey.

In this paper, a secure image encryption scheme based on logistic and spatiotemporal chaotic systems is proposed. The extreme sensitivity of chaotic system can greatly increase the complexity of the proposed scheme. Further more, the scheme also takes advantage of DNA coding and eight DNA coding rules are mixed to enhance the efficiency of image confusion and diffusion. To resist the chosen-plaintext attack, information entropy of DNA coded image is modulated as the parameter of spatiotemporal chaotic system, which can also guarantee the sensitivity of plain image in the encryption process. So even a slight change in plain image can cause the complete change in cipher image. The experimental analysis shows that it can resistant different attacks, such as the brute-force attack, statistical attack and differential attack. What’s more, The image encryption scheme can be easily implemented by software and is promising in practical application. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","DNA encoding; Image encryption; Information entropy; Spatiotemporal chaotic system","Application programs; Chaotic systems; Codes (symbols); Cryptography; DNA; Gene encoding; Image coding; Security of data; Chosen-plaintext attack; Differential attacks; DNA encoding; Experimental analysis; Image encryption scheme; Image encryptions; Information entropy; Spatiotemporal chaotic systems; Image processing"

The results showed that attitude toward resisting social engineering has the strongest direct association with intention to resist social engineering, while both self-efficacy and normative beliefs showed weak relationships with intention to resist social engineering. Furthermore, the results showed that transformational leadership was strongly associated with both perceived information security culture and information security awareness. Two mediation tests showed that attitude and normative beliefs partially mediate the effect of information security culture on employees' intention to resist social engineering. This suggests that both attitude and normative beliefs play important roles in governing the relationship between information security culture and intention to resist social engineering.

The proposed scheme can guarantee the identity of channel characteristics obtained by two legitimate transceivers via bidirectional training. A space hopping pattern generation algorithm is presented, which calculates the pattern according to channel characteristics. The antenna switching mode is controlled by the pattern that selects several antennas for fast switching transmission. Conventional schemes resort to a backward training method, hiding the channel between transceiver and eavesdropper so that an eavesdropper cannot receive correctly with wrong weighting, thus achieving security of transceivers. The default mode is that a receiver only receives. Contrarily, the proposed scheme uses a switching mode to ensure transmission secrecy. To improve training efficiency, a spatial frequency multiplexing training method is used, with almost identical accuracy and significantly enhanced efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has good performance in anti-eavesdropping as it causes a high bit error rate for the eavesdropper. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of Applied Sciences.

A promising step toward conquering this challenge is to formally verify that the end-to-end behavior of the computing system really satisfies various information-flow policies. Unfortunately, because today's system software still consists of both C and assembly programs, the end-to-end verification necessarily requires that we not only prove the security properties of individual components, but also carefully preserve these properties through compilation and cross-language linking. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for formally verifying end-to-end security of a software system that consists of both C and assembly programs. We introduce a general definition of observation function that unifies the concepts of policy specification, state indistinguishability, and whole-execution behaviors. We show how to use different observation functions for different levels of abstraction, and how to link different security proofs across abstraction levels using a special kind of simulation that is guaranteed to preserve state indistinguishability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our new methodology, we have successfully constructed an end-to-end security proof, fully formalized in the Coq proof assistant, of a nontrivial operating system kernel (running on an extended CompCert x86 assembly machine model). Some parts of the kernel are written in C and some are written in assembly; we verify all of the code, regardless of language. © 2016 ACM.","Certified OS Kernels; Information Flow Control; Program Verification; Security Policy Specification; Security-Preserving Simulation","Abstracting; C (programming language); Security of data; Specifications; Theorem proving; Verification; Certified OS kernel; Computing system; End-to-end security; End-to-end verifications; Information flow control; Policy specification; Program Verification; Security policy; Security policy specification; Security-preserving simulation; Program assemblers"

However, due to the open nature of the network, the security issue has become an important consideration in these network-based systems that cannot be ignored, especially in critical systems, such as life-critical system and financial system. User authentication scheme is the most used and effective mechanism for information security, and many user authentication schemes have been proposed by researchers. Recently, Shen et al. proposed a biometrics-based user authentication scheme for multi-server environments in critical systems. However, their scheme lacks the wrong password detection mechanism and is vulnerable to denial-of-service attack. Besides, they do not consider the user anonymity property, and may suffer from biometrics template lost attack because the biometrics template is directly stored in user’s smart card. In this paper, an enhanced biometrics-based user authentication scheme for multi-server environments in critical systems is presented by adopting the fuzzy extractor.

In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant protocol for smart metering that can handle general communication failures while ensuring DP with significantly improved efficiency and lower errors compared with the state of the art. Our protocol handles fail-stop faults proactively by using a novel design of future ciphertexts, and distributes trust among the smart meters by sharing secret keys among them. We prove the DP properties of our protocol and analyze its advantages in fault tolerance, accuracy, and communication efficiency relative to competing techniques.

These two methods use the spatial domain of images for hiding secret messages; however, they differ from each other, fundamentally. The MP method is an algorithm which, firstly, divides the ""Cover-Image"" into non-overlapping B×B blocks. Then, it hides the data in the 4th through 7th bit layers of the blue layer of the ""Cover-Image"", by generating unique tixt2 matrix patterns for each character in each block. The LSB method is an algorithm that hides data in the least significant bit of the ""Cover-Image"" pixels, which has the least visible effect on the transparency of the ""Stego-Image"". In the proposed algorithm, the first three bit layers, and the 4th to 7th bit layers of the blue layer of the RGB ""Cover-Image"" is used for hiding the ""Message"", with LSB and MP methods, respectively. This algorithm has two entrances for the ""Message""; one of them can be only text, ""Text Message"", which is hidden with the MP method. The other one, ""Binary Message"", can be any digital media, and is hidden with the LSB method. Our simulation and evaluation results show that this new method has a better capacity than the LSB and MP methods, by more than 1.265 and 4.77 times, correspondingly. Our results also indicate that the final ""Stego-Image"" has a high quality PSNR. © 2016 IEEE.","data hiding; image processing; information security; least significant bit (LSB); matrix pattern (MP); steganography; watermarking","Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Digital watermarking; Evolutionary algorithms; Image processing; Matrix algebra; Security of data; Steganography; Binary message; Data hiding; Evaluation results; High quality; Least significant bits; Matrix patterns; Secret messages; Spatial domains; Algorithms"

Research shows senior management participation is critical to successful IS security, but has not explained how senior managers are motivated to participate in IS security. Information systems research shows pressures external to the organization have greater influence on senior managers than internal pressures. However, research has not fully examined how external pressures motivate senior management participation in IS security. This study addressed that gap by examining how external pressures motivate senior management participation in ISS through the lens of neo-institutional theory. The research design was survey research. Data collection was through an online survey, and PLS was used for data analysis. Sample size was 167 from a study population of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in a mix of industries in the south-central United States. Results supported three of six hypotheses. Mimetic mechanisms were found to influence senior management belief in IS security, and senior management belief in IS security was found to increase senior management participation in IS security. Greater senior management participation in IS security led to greater IS security assimilation in organizations. Three hypotheses were not supported. Correlation was not found between normative influences and senior management belief, normative influences and senior management participation, and coercive influences and senior management participation. This study shows IS security-related mimetic influences have greater impact on senior leaders of SMEs than coercive or normative influences, which may be explained by the absorptive capacity of SMEs. Absorptive capacity refers to the ability of an organization to assimilate a technology. However, absorptive capacity may affect more than just technology assimilation, and may extend to how senior management responds to external influences. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

SolarWheels visualizes the multilayer multidimensional computer network issues with a series of integrated circular visualizations inspired by the metaphor of the solar system. To amplify user interaction and experience, the system provides a three-zone physical interaction that allows multiple users to interact with the system. Users can read details at different levels depending on their distance from the display. An expert evaluation study, based on a four-layer affordance framework, was conducted to assess and improve the interactive visualization design. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Affordance; Cybersecurity; Information visualization; Situational awareness; User experience; Visual analytics",""

Thus, based on Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) and Discrete Logarithm (DL), an efficient and security CLS scheme without pairings is proposed in this paper.

The resulting globalization of the software industry has not only increased software reuse, but also introduced new challenges. Among the challenges, arising from the knowledge sharing is Information Security, which has emerged to become a major threat to the software development community, since not only source code but also its vulnerabilities are shared across project boundaries. Developers are unaware of such security vulnerabilities in their projects, often until a vulnerability is either exploited by attackers or made publicly available by independent security advisory databases. In this research, we present a modeling approach, which takes advantage of Semantic Web technologies, to establish traceability links between security advisory repositories and other software repositories. More specifically, we establish a unified ontological representation, which supports bi-directional traceability links between knowledge captured in software build repositories and specialized vulnerability database. These repositories can be considered trusted information silos that are typically not directly linked to other resources, such as source code repositories containing the reported instances of these problems. The novelty of our approach is that it allows us to overcome some of these traditional information silos and transform them into information hubs, which promote sharing of knowledge across repository boundaries. We conducted several experiments to illustrate the applicability of our approach by tracing existing vulnerabilities to projects which might directly or indirectly be affected by vulnerabilities inherited from other projects and libraries. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Impact analysis; Semantic knowledge modelling; Semantic web; Software security vulnerabilities; Software traceability","Computer software reusability; Information dissemination; Security of data; Semantic Web; Software design; Software engineering; Impact analysis; Ontological representation; Security vulnerabilities; Semantic knowledge; Software development process; Software security; Software traceability; Source code repositories; World Wide Web"

Because they have more experience dealing with cybersecurity, information technology (IT) departments also have more knowledge than their operations technology (OT) counterparts about how to protect against probes, intrusions and attacks. Gary Williams, senior director of technology and cybersecurity at Schneider Electric, recommends to adopt a standard such as ISA99/IEC62443 to give participants a common vocabulary about cybersecurity between departments, divisions, companies and larger organizations. He also recommends to complete gap analyses to check for vulnerabilities in existing equipment, systems and software, especially undocumented ports and network connections. Because developing and implementing a cybersecurity policy must occur above the operations level, Steve Mallett and Dee Brown add it’s crucial to involve any organization’s leadership as well. Beyond strategies and experts, there are many new software and hardware tools and services for improving cybersecurity, especially as process applications overlap with the Internet. Underwriters Laboratories just started its Cybersecurity Assurance Program (UL CAP), which uses the new UL 2900 standards to offer testable cybersecurity criteria for network-connectable products and systems to assess software vulnerabilities and weaknesses, minimize exploitation, address known malware, review security controls and increase security awareness.","","Application programs; Malware; Network connection; Process applications; Schneider electrics; Security awareness; Software and hardwares; Software vulnerabilities; Systems and software; Underwriters laboratories; Network security"

A comprehensive literature review serves two purposes: to confirm the problem and to provide a structured way of revealing the requirement areas. Following the uncovering of the requirement areas, CSIRT business requirements and services are introduced, before exploring the relationships between the areas using argumentation. This culminates in the development of the management model in two parts: a strategic view and a tactical view. The strategic view comprises the business requirements and ""higher"" level decisions - the environment, constituency and funding considerations - that need to be made when establishing a CSIRT. The tactical view follows by presenting the ""how"" considerations.

On the other hand, blindspots are harmful omissions in strategy implementation due to reasons such as corporate inertia or management obsessiveness in pursuing a certain vision mismatched with reality. This article outlines the main areas in which customer trust is stressed in Chilean Bussiness-to-Consumer (B2C) electronic commerce (e-commerce) and how e-buyers circumvent the problems that arise in those areas of stress, from a communications perspective. We not only discovered compensatory strategies devised by users in overcoming those problems, but also some relevant corporate blindspots in that sector that should be addressed by retailers. Despite the strong growth of retail sales in that emerging Latin American country, Chilean B2C e-commerce is relatively weak and problems of trust may be an important cause. Four areas of stress were outlined: previous perceptions about the firm, clarity and coherence of online information, security of personal data, and post-sales service. Within these, inter-channel communication incoherence, lack of integration between retailers and outsourced logistics, and incoherent notions of trust emerged as the most important corporate blindspots harming the relationship with customers. On the other hand, we identified four compensatory strategies used by clients: selective auto-exposure, informal ""certifications"", online/ offline hybridization and anticipation/incorporation of other people experience.

But, the major challenge of CHIS use is information security. This study attempts to evaluate CHIS information security risk management at hospitals of Iran. Materials and methods: This applied study is a descriptive and cross-sectional research that has been conducted in 2015. The data were collected from 551 hospitals of Iran. Based on literature review, experts’ opinion, and observations at five hospitals, our intensive questionnaire was designed to assess security risk management for CHISs at the concerned hospitals, which was then sent to all hospitals in Iran by the Ministry of Health. Results: Sixty-nine percent of the studied hospitals pursue information security policies and procedures in conformity with Iran Hospitals Accreditation Standards. At some hospitals, risk identification, risk evaluation, and risk estimation, as well as risk treatment, are unstructured without any specified approach or methodology. There is no significant structured approach to risk management at the studied hospitals. Conclusion: Information security risk management is not followed by Iran’s hospitals and their information security policies. This problem can cause a large number of challenges for their CHIS security in future. Therefore, Iran’s Ministry of Health should develop practical policies to improve information security risk management in the hospitals of Iran. © 2016 Zarei and Sadoughi.","Health information systems; Hospital; Information security; Risk management","accreditation; cross-sectional study; doctor patient relation; human; medical information system; questionnaire; risk management"

There are four components in a smart grid, namely, smart power generation, smart transmission, smart distribution, and smart end use. Among them, the smart home technique controls the energy consumption of each end user, also known as customer, which potentially impacts the energy generation, transmission, and distribution.The smart home infrastructure features the automatic control of various interconnected modern home appliances. Together with the salient scheduling algorithms, it enables the customers to schedule the energy consumption, thus avoiding using electricity energy during the peak hours. This results in the reduction of electricity bill from the customer's perspective and improved balance of the energy load from the utility's perspective. The aforementioned process involves the usage of guideline pricing which estimates the future electricity price added by smart home controller. Despite its effectiveness, the smart home system is vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks. A hacker can manipulate the received guideline price and mislead the schedulers to make wrong decisions of energy scheduling. This can impact the bills of the customers and the peak energy usage of the power system.

This is achieved by dispersing data along multiple secure paths in such a way that the highest encryption level is applied to those paths where threats are most likely to be present. Conversely, for those paths where the likelihood of attack is least, the encryption levels should be commensurately lower. In order to maintain data privacy, path encryption level adjustments should be proactive. In so doing, the multipath network should have the ability to calculate the probability of an attack and proactively adjust the encryption strength long before the final steps of an attack sequence occur. The unique methods described in this research, are able to sense when an attack sequence is initiated on a path. This is achieved by calculating the probability of the presence of specific attack sequence signatures along each network path using statistical learning techniques, and by deriving path information assurance levels using these probabilities. As an attack sequence progresses, the likelihood of the presence of specific attacks grows until a threshold level is met and an encryption adjustment for a path is warranted. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anomaly detection; Data encryption; Information assurance; Intrusion detection; Multipath security","Data privacy; Intrusion detection; Network security; Probability; Anomaly detection; Attack sequences; Data encryption; Information assurance; Multipath; Path informations; Statistical learning techniques; Threshold levels; Cryptography"

In this paper, we propose a cross-layer design framework for resource-constrained cyber-physical systems. The framework combines control-theoretic methods at the functional layer and cybersecurity techniques at the embedded platform layer, and addresses security together with other design metrics such as control performance under resource and real-time constraints. We use the concept of interface variables to capture the interactions between control and platform layers, and quantitatively model the relation among system security, performance, and schedulability via interface variables. The general codesign framework is customized and refined to the automotive domain, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through an industrial case study and a set of synthetic examples. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","codesign; control performance; cross-layer; Cyber-physical systems; schedulability; security","Embedded systems; Losses; Co-designs; Control performance; Cross layer; Schedulability; security; Cyber Physical System"

Those digital assets which meet any of the following criteria are within the scope of the ""Cyber Security Rule"" and must be protected from unauthorized access and manipulation. • Performs safety related function. • Performs function that is important to safety. • Performs emergency preparedness function including offsite communications. • Performs security function. In addition, because TVA is a federal agency, TVA's cyber security program must address Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cyber security requirements set forth in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). TVA's nuclear generating fleet identified approximately 7800 critical digital assets subject to these requirements. Each of these devices must be evaluated against approximately 670 cyber security controls. Therefore, the assessment process must address approximately 5,200,000 control-asset interactions. In response to this challenge TVA's Computer Engineering Group developed a cyber security assessment process and tool that seamlessly integrates the two sets of cyber security requirements into one program. When the tool was developed, no commercial product was available that captured information about the digital assets in plant systems, the applicability of the hundreds of cyber security controls that they must be evaluated against, and the remediation actions necessary to address identified vulnerabilities. What makes this tool unique is that it contains the logic, functionality, and assessment methodology that streamlines the assessment process and the application of cyber controls to the plant's digital assets. It also enables TVA to automatically generate system security plans that document the assessment results. The assessment tool enabled T VA to evaluate all 5.2 million control-asset interactions and the development of remediation plans for the nuclear fleet in 42 weeks. The tool not only ensured standard application of the assessment methodology across the fleet, it also standardized the application of the cyber security controls to all digital assets within the scope of the NRC and OMB programs. The tool ensured consistency in the development of remediation actions to address identified vulnerabilities and consistent documentation of the assessment results. The chief outputs of the tool are system security plans which document the status of each control-asset interaction and remediation actions for compliance. Use of the tool also reduced the risk of human performance errors in the assessment process. Vetting the remediation actions and consistently applying the cyber security controls helps reduce the risk of a cyber attack. The tool supports not only the baseline cyber security assessments performed as part of the cyber security program's initial rollout, it also supports changes to the plant as part of the configuration management processes to ensure changes to the plant's digital devices are assessed against the same criteria and documented in the same manner. It ensures that the cyber security controls are applied in the same manner and that remediation actions are addressed during the design process.","",""

With the sensitivity of the data involved, authentication mechanism such as fixed-text password, PIN, or unlock patterns are used to safeguard these data against intruders. However, these mechanisms have the risk from security threats such as cracking or shoulder surfing. To enhance mobile and/or information security, this study aimed to develop a free-form handwriting gesture user authentication for smartphones. It also tried to discover the static and dynamic handwriting features that significantly influence the recognition of a legitimate user. The experiment was then conducted by asking thirty (30) individuals to draw or swipe using their fingertip their desired free-form security pattern ten (10) times. These patterns were then cleaned and processed, and extracted seven (7) static and eleven (11) dynamic handwriting features. By means of Neural Network classifier of the RapidMiner data mining tool, these features were used to develop, validate, and test a model for user authentication. The model showed a very promising recognition rate of 96.67%. The model is further tested through a prototype, and it still gave a very satisfactory result. © 2016 ACM.","Authentication; Gesture; Information security; Model; Shoulder surfing","Android (operating system); Character recognition; Data mining; Dynamics; Mobile security; Models; Security of data; Smartphones; Software engineering; Authentication mechanisms; Data-mining tools; Gesture; Legitimate users; Neural network classifier; Security patterns; Shoulder surfing; User authentication; Authentication"

First, an enlarged image is formed by assembling two plain images successively in the horizontal direction and scrambled in the chaotic permutation process, in which the sequences of chaotic pairs are generated by the two-dimensional Sine Logistic modulation map. Second, the scrambled image is divided into two components which are used to constitute a complex image. One component is normalized and regarded as the phase part of the complex image as well as other is considered as the amplitude part. Finally, the complex image is shared between the sender and the receiver by using the Shamir's three-pass protocol, in which the discrete multiple-parameter fractional angular transform is used as the encryption function due to its commutative property. The proposed double-image sharing scheme has an obvious advantage that the key management is convenient without distributing the random phase mask keys in advance. Moreover, the security of the image sharing scheme is enhanced with the help of extra parameters of the discrete multiple-parameter fractional angular transform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on integrating the Shamir's three-pass protocol with double-image sharing scheme in the information security field.

To extend their analysis of cybercrime by an economic view, we customized their model and used it as basis for our analysis. Based on the data from recent literature, our assessment gives insights into the perpetrator's behavior and allows us to quantify the effectiveness of countermeasures. Due to the fact that mainly risk-seeking persons are responsible for these attacks, countermeasures aiming at increasing the penalties are not very effective. We discovered that better control of dark markets to prevent the trading of stolen data has a much higher impact.

With ICs reaching upwards of billions of transistors, detecting hardware trojans (HT) is like finding a needle in a haystack. Therefore, it becomes imperative to protect critical computing infrastructure from malicious attackers attempting to unearth vital information. Security enhancements should offer resiliency to limit their impact on overall chip performance as HTs are likely to slip through detection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose packet-security (P-Sec) a packet validation technique to protect compromised network-on-chip (NoC) architectures from fault injection side channel attacks and covert HT communication by merging two robust error detection schemes, namely algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes. With P-Sec, applications containing sensitive and encrypted data can be protected from an ideal attacker using AMD codes at the cost of marginal area and power overhead in the network interface but with enhanced security on demand. © 2016 EDAA.","","Hardware; Hardware security; Malware; Network-on-chip; Reconfigurable hardware; Side channel attack; VLSI circuits; Algebraic manipulations; Computing infrastructures; Cyclic redundancy check codes; Detection mechanism; Network-on-chip architectures; Path sensitization; Security enhancements; Technology scaling; Network security"

CAPTCHA is a method which distinguishes human beings from artificial intelligence which is usually called bots on Internet. Bots acquire accounts of web services for unfair uses such as stealth marketing or SPAM attacks. That is, CAPTCHA is a countermeasure against those attacks. The most popular kind of CAPTCHA methods is text-based CAPTCHA in which distorted alphabets and numbers appear with obstacles or noise. However, it is known that all of text-based CAPTCHA algorithms can be analyzed by computers. In addition, too much distortion or noise prevents human beings from alphabets or numbers. There are other kinds of CAPTCHA methods such as image CAPTCHA and audio CAPTCHA. However, they also have problems in use. As a related work, an effective text-based CAPTCHA algorithm with amodal completion was proposed. The CAPTCHA provides computers a large amount of calculation cost while amodal completion helps human beings to recognize characters momentarily. On the other hand, extreme concentration is required for momentary recognition. The CAPTCHA is once improved in our laboratory. Aftereffects are additionally combined with the CAPTCHA algorithm. Moreover, in this paper, we add colors to the algorithm with considering combinations of complementary colors and those of luminance. The aftereffects extend time for recognition of characters from a moment to several seconds. © 2016 IEEE.","CAPTCHA; Information Security; Recognition","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Color; Electronic mail filters; Internet; Luminance; Security of data; Web services; Amodal completions; Calculation cost; CAPTCHAs; Complementary colors; Image captcha; Large amounts; Recognition; Related works; Network security"

Despite this, such a technology is vulnerable to various security threats. A particularly important example is pricing cyberattack where hackers manipulate the guideline electricity pricing seen at the smart meters such that the electricity bills of hackers can be reduced and the local power system balance can be disturbed. This cybersecurity problem aggravates with the integration of renewable energy. The main reason is that renewable energy sources are associated with the inherent uncertainties. Since the total energy demand is equal to those requested from customers, it induces the uncertainties to the energy demand from the utility. The introduction of net metering technique that allows the customers to sell the excessively generated renewable energy back to the grid, further increases variations in energy supply. There are some technical advances in developing detection and defense frameworks against pricing cyberattacks. However, none of them considers the renewable energy integration or impact of net metering.In this book chapter, we will describe the impact of the integration of renewable energy and net metering technology on the smart home pricing cyberattack detection. Renewable energy and net metering change the grid energy demand, which is considered by the utility when designing the guideline price. If the cyberattack detection technique does not consider this, the detection performance would be degraded. This motivates us to develop a new smart home pricing cyberattack detection framework which handles the aforementioned impact into the detection. The simulation results demonstrate that our new framework can significantly improve the detection accuracy for about 30% compared to the state-of-art technique. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Students need exposure to offensive techniques developed usually by hackers, along with the defensive techniques. This is problematic since students need to work with tools that may pose threat to the stability and security of the laboratories' computers and live networks within academic institutions. In an attempt to overcome the aforementioned issue, this paper discusses an ethical educational platform, called DoS-VLab, that aims at allowing students experience common denial of service (DoS) attacks, in secure academic environment. DoS-VLab platform is based on virtualization technologies and GNS3 network simulator for building virtual networks. Compared to traditional physical laboratories, practices show that the DoS-VLab platform helped produce more lab practices within the students, reduced training hours required for implementing hands-on lab exercises, and resulted in higher completion rate of the hands-on lab exercises. © 2016 IEEE.","Denial of Service attacks; Ethical hacking; Hands-on lab exercises; Information security education; Virtualization technologies","E-learning; Engineering education; Laboratories; Network security; Personal computing; Philosophical aspects; Students; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Academic environment; Academic institutions; Educational platforms; Hands-on lab exercises; Information security education; Information security professionals; Physical laboratory; Virtualization technologies; Denial-of-service attack"

Big data is a technical term used today to represent this massive growth of digital data that's being created from many sources. Organizations have turned their attentions to the deployment of Big Data analytics to gain valuable insights that benefit their businesses within protected and secure environments. Hence, network security protocols, especially authentication protocols, are being re-designed to protect and to deliver the real benefits of this data growth. Contrary to the traditional perspective, in which researchers are focusing on identifying users' identity to protect Big Data-based environments, we have an opposite perspective that the Big Data itself would be the fuel for the next generation authentication. In other word, the main goal of this work is to propose a new framework for user authentication that leverages Big Data analytics. The core idea of this framework is to find out unique patterns of the users' dynamic behaviors. The proposed framework comprised of three main components. Data Security-based Analytics (DSA); describing the best utilization of the high velocity data streams, which is capable for distinguishing data that has security/identification potentials. Human dynamics measure engine; that develops an ambitious transformation from the Big Data characteristics into the relevant human dynamics measures.

Here, we test the hypotheses that two traits that are typically enhanced in autism spectrum disorders—attention to detail and systemizing—may be positively related to both the choice of pursuing a career in information security and skilled performance in a prototypical hacking task (i.e., crypto-analysis or code-breaking). A group of naïve participants and of ethical hackers completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient, including an attention to detail scale, and the Systemizing Quotient (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001, 2003). They were also tested with behavioral tasks involving code-breaking and a control task involving security X-ray image interpretation. Hackers reported significantly higher systemizing and attention to detail than non-hackers. We found a positive relation between self-reported systemizing (but not attention to detail) and code-breaking skills in both hackers and non-hackers, whereas attention to detail (but not systemizing) was related with performance in the X-ray screening task in both groups, as previously reported with naïve participants (Rusconi et al., 2015).

This onslaught of advanced attacks requires far more than baseline security practices. While most security professionals are APT-aware, many lack the experience, requisite skills, and the ability to integrate technology to counter APT attacks. The problem is exacerbated by a widening cybersecurity skills gap. Recent research by ISACA, the world’s largest information security professional association, reported more than 60% of applicants for entry level cybersecurity positions lack the skill and ability to perform the tasks associated with their potential new roles. Success against the APT is predicated on insight into APT attack stages and the integration of technology to enable organizational resilience; however, this is not possible in organizations do not have the workforce with the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform the technical tasks related to their functional roles. This article addresses a customized response strategy executed by a skilled workforce that mitigates and even counters attacks. The strategy recommends that a coordinated response based on organization risk management policies be implemented. In addition, it requires organizational insight into their information assets, control of administrator privileges, implementation of sound network segregation architecture, and a commitment to a balanced vulnerability management program. It is critical that a further discussion occur to outline skills acquisition based on skills-based training and performance-based assessments. © 2016, © Copyright 2016 Taylor & Francis.","","administrative framework; critical analysis; detection method; digitization; mitigation; performance assessment; research work; security; training; vulnerability"

However, the two well-developed theories may not fully induce compliance behavior of ISSP given the growing trend of IS security violation in China. Deterrence and rational choice calculus employ an assumption of general awareness of ISSP to address compliance behavior. However, employees may judge their compliance behavior of ISSP in terms of positive and negative emotions but not the trade-off of benefits and costs (risks) only in the compliance. Grounded in regulatory focus theory (RFT), we propose a research model that addresses the motivational mechanisms for employees to comply with ISSP. We adopt a scenario-based questionnaire to survey employees of Chinese SMEs for model testing. The empirical results indicate that promotion-Approach is better than promotion-Avoidance in motivating compliance intention when employees are aware of the ISSP in their companies. However, promotion-Approach and promotion-Avoidance are ineffective in inducing compliance intention when employees are unaware of ISSP in Chinese SMEs. Information security awareness is not a necessary condition of the compliance of ISSP.

The most critical asset of an organization is information which can be of any type i.e. electronic or in hard form. Different assets like backup drives, office files in either soft or hard form, networking devices etc. have large amount of information that needs to be protected from unauthorized access. Asset management is the methodical process of maintaining, upgrading and operating the assets. It has great significance to the business community as the value of assets is their influence on accomplishing the predefined organizational objectives. In academic institutes, information asset is used in teaching, research, administration and management, so all the assets containing useful information must be properly managed so that it remains available to the users. Unfortunately information security cannot be guaranteed 100% by any mean or method. Therefore there is a need for standards to ensure best security practices to provide adequate level of security.

The secret information is divided into three blocks using a specific pattern, followed by an encryption mechanism based on the three-level encryption algorithm (TLEA). The input image is scrambled using a secret key, and the encrypted sub-message blocks are then embedded in the scrambled image by cyclic18 least significant bit (LSB) substitution method, utilizing LSBs and intermediate LSB planes. Furthermore, the cover image and its planes are rotated at different angles using a secret key prior to embedding, deceiving the attacker during data extraction. The usage of message blocks division, TLEA, image scrambling, and the cyclic18 LSB method results in an advanced security system, maintaining the visual transparency of resultant images and increasing the security of embedded data. In addition, employing various secret keys for image scrambling, data encryption, and data hiding using the cyclic18 LSB method makes the data recovery comparatively more challenging for attackers.

Moreover, even though there have been efforts from Google and the Open Handset Alliance (OHA), among others, towards reducing the impact of security threats in Android, malicious attacks continue to increase in frequency and complexity. Interestingly, bad software development practices still are being considered a major surface attack provider, mainly due to the lack of knowledge or misuse of Android security features.

Further to discuss the expectations for EHRs in 1992 and explore which of them were realized and what events accelerated or disrupted/derailed how EHRs evolved.; METHODS: Literature search based on ""Electronic Health Record"", ""Medical Record"", and ""Medical Chart"" using Medline, Google, Wikipedia Medical, and Cochrane Libraries resulted in an initial review of 2,356 abstracts and other information in papers and books. Additional papers and books were identified through the review of references cited in the initial review.; RESULTS: By 1992, hardware had become more affordable, powerful, and compact and the use of personal computers, local area networks, and the Internet provided faster and easier access to medical information. EHRs were initially developed and used at academic medical facilities but since most have been replaced by large vendor EHRs. While EHR use has increased and clinicians are being prepared to practice in an EHR-mediated world, technical issues have been overshadowed by procedural, professional, social, political, and especially ethical issues as well as the need for compliance with standards and information security. There have been enormous advancements that have taken place, but many of the early expectations for EHRs have not been realized and current EHRs still do not meet the needs of today's rapidly changing healthcare environment.; CONCLUSION: The current use of EHRs initiated by new technology would have been hard to foresee. Current and new EHR technology will help to provide international standards for interoperable applications that use health, social, economic, behavioral, and environmental data to communicate, interpret, and act intelligently upon complex healthcare information to foster precision medicine and a learning health system.","Electronic Health Record; medical chart; medical record","Computer Systems; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Forecasting; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; clinical decision support system; computer system; electronic health record; forecasting; history; human; standards; trends"

Protecting their technical infrastructure and stored data is, therefore, also becoming more vital. Nevertheless, research into the safety and security of entrepreneurs in general, and online threats targeted at entrepreneurs in particular, is still limited. This study investigates to what extent self-employed entrepreneurs protect themselves against online threats, and what motivates them to do so. Based on secondary analyses on data collected from 1622 Dutch entrepreneurs, we observe that the majority implement technical and personal coping measures. By adopting protection motivation theory as a theoretical basis for our study, we found that coping appraisal explains the adoption of protective measures. Entrepreneurs are likely to implement protective measures when they believe a measure is effective, when they are capable of using internet technology, when their attitude towards online protection is positive and when they believe they are responsible for their own online security. Although the secondary analysis provides some limitations, this study offers new insights into the usage of protective measures and the motivation for taking them. These insights can help to improve information security campaigns. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coping; cybercrime; information security behaviours; Protection motivation theory; risk; self-employed entrepreneurs","Motivation; Risks; Security of data; coping; Cybercrime; Information security behaviours; Protection motivation theory; self-employed entrepreneurs; adoption; Internet; motivation; secondary analysis; theoretical model; Computer crime"

However, there are many students whose level of awareness on this subject is still not enough considering the occurrence of security risks and their frequent usage of the internet. Many studies have been conducted to assess students and to raise their level of IS awareness. This study concerns about students' knowledge and their behaviour or action towards IS. This study investigates whether students' knowledge influence positively over their cultural habits of ignoring things in IS environment. This study inspects students' knowledge about risks that face them daily particularly when they deal with their emails, social network accounts, software downloading and installing and public network. This study selected students from two universities from the eastern part of Saudi Arabia (Dammam and King Faisal University).

This results in blurred outlines for monitoring, evaluation and enforcement of the security policy for the employees causing confusion in adhering and implementing it which leads to lack of process of publishing form the security policy, end user awareness, translation of high level policy to lowest level component configuration plans and actions to take in time of crisis. This leads to the critical need for the designing an empirically tested, comprehensive security policy design. This paper proposes bridging the gap between the high level information security policy descriptions with the low level network infrastructure security implementation. Background Objectives: With new and innovative technologies such as Cloud, Remote computing, Enterprise Mobility, e-commerce on the rise, network security has remained an ever increasing challenge. This paper presents a security framework to bridge the gap between high level specification requirements and the low level implementation phase for network infrastructure security using the network architecture model with the security policies associated with the network components required to be enforced. Methods/Statistical Analysis: To achieve the framework design, architectural model and a set of design-level security policies are taken into consideration. Also discussed are the advantages and desired characteristics of the model, relating to existing process worked in the design area; and future research directions are pointed. Findings: The current information security policy development life cycle tends to have few disadvantages with the most critical being the overall lack of view of the policy. Typically a narrow view can be found when focusing only on development of the security policy documents and not including the actual practices for implementation or even maintenance of the security policies. This process does not address how the security policy would be development and enforced or even evaluated. The life cycle designs usually focus on policy for development instead of focusing on development process of the information security policy. Application: Utilizing Hybrid cloud architecture design so that internet facing tiers tend to be public clouds and internal secure applications and database tend to be private clouds. This change in network architecture helps take on the volumetric network and application layer DDoS attacks to ensure the traffic reaching the internal network tiers is free from such attackers. Using Rate controls, built-in intelligent WAFs, Client Reputation monitoring, be used in combination as part of a comprehensive defense against all types and sizes of cyber threats.","Information security policy; Network architecture; Network firewall; Network infrastructure; Network security policy; WAF",""

It is imperative that users be informed about a security incident in a timely manner in order to make proper decisions. Visualization of security threats and warnings is one of the effective ways to inform users. However, visual cues are not always accessible to all users, and in particular, those with visual impairments. This late-breaking-work paper hypothesizes that the use of proper sounds in conjunction with visual cues can better represent security alerts to all users. Toward our research goal to validate this hypothesis, we first describe a methodology, referred to as sonification, to effectively design and develop auditory cyber-security threat indicators to warn users about cyber-attacks. Next, we present a case study, along with the results, of various types of usability testing conducted on a number of Internet users who are visually impaired. The presented concept can be viewed as a general framework for the creation and evaluation of human factor interactions with sounds in a cyber-space domain.

When generating and using random sequences, we need to test their randomness. Statistical test is a traditional testing method for random numbers. The NIST SP 800-22 Statistical Test Suit is one of the most common-used test suits, which contains 15 test items. Each test item is composed of first-level test and second-level test. In SP 800-22, for normal distribution based test items, we found that their second-level tests are not complete, as the statistical flaws may still exist in the sequence even if the sequence passes the test item. The P_value which is computed during the normal-distribution-test can apply to the first level test, but it does not fit the second level test. Because in the second level test, the random sequence does not always satisfy the tested features, even if this P_value is equally distributed and the random sequence passed the test. For this reason, in contrast to the original standard level two test which assesses the uniformity of P_value, we introduce Q_value and propose to assess its uniformity in the second-level test. We also give a non-asymptotic distribution of Q_value. We found that the distribution of Q_value is much closer to the uniform distribution than the P_value, and it can reduce false test rate. Thus, it is more reliable to take it as the test item of the second level test. Finally, through the experiments, we demonstrate that the Q_value is able to find some more subtle statistical flaws of the tested sequence. © 2016 Journal of Cryptologic Research.

Most of the keylogger softwares available, intercept the key after it has been translated according to the current language-specific keyboard layout, selected by the user or application. Taking benefit of this characteristic, this paper proposes a new prevention technique. The idea is to use multiple layouts, to make the keyboard layout inconstant to mislead the keylogger. This technique works as follow; with each key press the current keyboard layout is changed, and replaced randomly by one of the multiple predesigned layouts. By this way every keylogger sits after the keyboard driver, and intercept the key after it has been translated by the keyboard layout, will log unreadable information because the keyboard layout is inconstant, and will be misled. After the character is posted to the appropriate window, it should be converted back to the intended language-specific keyboard layout. © 2016 IEEE.","kernelspace keylogger; keyboard input model; keylogger; spyware; user-space keylogger","Computational linguistics; Computer keyboards; Computer viruses; Security of data; Translation (languages); Input modeling; Keyboard layout; Log file; OR applications; Prevention techniques; Third parties; User information; User spaces; Malware"

The main problem to be solved by one-way gateways is to make secure communication between network segments with different security levels to maintain multilevel security policy. Although one-way gateways are utilized in lot of information systems, there is no solution, including 'air gap', to assure one-way transfer in fact and they are not resistant against data leakage via covert channels. We analyzed state of the art technologies and products supporting one-way data transfer, worked out the requirements for one-way gateway with assured data transmitting.

It attempts to securely embed patient's confidential information into his/her medical images. Methods: The proposed information security scheme conceals coded Electronic Patient Records (EPRs) into medical images in order to protect the EPRs’ confidentiality without affecting the image quality and particularly the Region of Interest (ROI), which is essential for diagnosis. The secret EPR data is converted into ciphertext using private symmetric encryption method. Since the Human Visual System (HVS) is less sensitive to alterations in sharp regions compared to uniform regions, a simple edge detection method has been introduced to identify and embed in edge pixels, which will lead to an improved stego image quality. In order to increase the embedding capacity, the algorithm embeds variable number of bits (up to 3) in edge pixels based on the strength of edges. Moreover, to increase the efficiency, two message coding mechanisms have been utilized to enhance the ±1 steganography. The first one, which is based on Hamming code, is simple and fast, while the other which is known as the Syndrome Trellis Code (STC), is more sophisticated as it attempts to find a stego image that is close to the cover image through minimizing the embedding impact. The proposed steganography algorithm embeds the secret data bits into the Region of Non Interest (RONI), where due to its importance; the ROI is preserved from modifications. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can embed large amount of secret data without leaving a noticeable distortion in the output image. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is also proven using one of the efficient steganalysis techniques. Conclusion: The proposed medical imaging information system proved to be capable of concealing EPR data and producing imperceptible stego images with minimal embedding distortions compared to other existing methods. In order to refrain from introducing any modifications to the ROI, the proposed system only utilizes the Region of Non Interest (RONI) in embedding the EPR data. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Cryptography; Digital steganography; Edge detection; EPR; Hamming code; STC","Algorithms; Computer Security; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Block codes; Chemical detection; Cryptography; Diagnosis; Image coding; Image enhancement; Image quality; Image segmentation; Information use; Medical imaging; Medical information systems; Paramagnetic resonance; Pixels; Steganography; Confidential information; Edge detection methods; Electronic patient record; Hamming code; Human visual system (HVS); Region of non interests; Syndrometrellis codes (STC); The region of interest (ROI); Article; coding algorithm; confidentiality; data extraction; diagnostic imaging; electronic patient record; embedding; human; image quality; medical information system; patient information; algorithm; computer security; electronic health record; image processing; Edge detection"

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is one of the most efficient techniques that are used for this issue, because it is difficult for the adversary to solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem to know the secret key that is used in encryption and decryption processes. A new efficient method has been proposed in this paper to improve the Menezes-Vanstone Elliptic Curve Cryptography (MVECC). This modification reduces the running time needed for encryption and decryption processes compared with the original method and another two methods. In the modified method, only addition and subtraction operations are used, and no inversion or multiplication operations because it consumes a long time comparing with addition and subtraction, and this makes the proposed algorithm faster in computations and running time than the original and other methods. Moreover, the modified method uses the hexadecimal ASCII value to encode each character in the message before encryption, which makes the algorithm more secure and complicated to resist the adversaries. © 2005 - 2016 JATIT & LLS.

Studies of various aspects of this problem look especially promising in a contemporary society that relies on electronic information sources and particularly important in view of the various strategies used by the Islamic State to lure new supporters. ISIS recommends itself to its potential supporters as an ideal place where true human values are respected and flourish and which has already united members of different eth- nic communities. The way ethnic identities are being shaped amid the alien cultural stereotypes imposed on them is determined by the way the communities with long-standing histories and specific cultures, confessions, and political preferences cooperate among themselves. Sociocultural coexistence of different ethnic groups in an electronic-information society requires social consensus based on compromises and complementary relations between the ethnic majorities and minorities. The Islamic State exploits this aspect to promote its ideas. Sociology and the humanities have written a lot about the ways ethnic identities are formed, however empirical studies offer widely different information about the age and other specifics of the process of acquiring a personal ethnic identity. This is why we have undertaken an analysis of the place and nature of ethnic identity in the matrix of the individual’s social identity, as well as the age specifics related to the samplings of specific ethnic affiliations. In Russia, social studies have never questioned the importance of the processes that form ethnic identity; this problem, however, has not yet been consistently studied and adequately represented. Psychologists and their colleagues working in other fields have been invariably attracted by the emergence and development of ethnic identity; today, the problems that have moved to the fore in national politics have added urgency to this and related subjects. Ethnic identity is “inherited” at birth; it becomes consolidated by use of the native language and the cultural environment, which, in turn, suggests the generally accepted standards of behavior and self-realization. Confessional identity, on the other hand, is a social construct that might be transformed or even radicalized. We have identified ethnocultural information security as cooperation among all of its subjects free from social violence that helps them meet their requirements through personal confidential and ethnoconfessional cognitive communication responsible for the referential value of the milieu and psychological health and full-scale personal development for all. © 2016, CA and CC Press AB.

Based on this evaluation criteria, we suggest HSV as the most suitable color space for steganography among the four color models including RGB, YCbCr, HSI, and Lab. Furthermore, we propose an imperceptible steganographic method using the chosen color space based on block-wise magic least significant bit substitution which achieves balance between the time complexity and image quality.

The numerical results demonstrate that with proper selection of the wavelength spacing, high-quality chaos synchronization can be achieved on each wavelength, and each wavelength can afford several OLT-ONU transmissions by properly allocating the frequency spacing of subcarriers.

To study the current state of radiology security, we explored the worldwide security of medical image archives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the DICOM data-transmitting standard, we implemented a highly parallel application to scan the entire World Wide Web of networked computers and devices, locating open and unprotected radiology servers. We used only legal and radiology-compliant tools. Our security-probing application initiated a standard DICOM handshake to remote computer or device addresses, and then assessed their security posture on the basis of handshake replies. RESULTS: The scan discovered a total of 2774 unprotected radiology or DICOM servers worldwide. Of those, 719 were fully open to patient data communications. Geolocation was used to analyze and rank our findings according to country utilization. As a result, we built maps and world ranking of clinical security, suggesting that even the most radiology-advanced countries have hospitals with serious security gaps. CONCLUSION: Despite more than two decades of active development and implementation, our radiology data still remains insecure. The results provided should be applied to raise awareness and begin an earnest dialogue toward elimination of the problem. The application we designed and the novel scanning approach we developed can be used to identify security breaches and to eliminate them before they are compromised. © American Roentgen Ray Society.","DICOM; Firewall; Networking; Pacs; Security","Algorithms; Computer Security; Internet; Radiology Department, Hospital; Radiology Information Systems; Security Measures; Article; computer security; computer system; digital imaging and communications in medicine; e-mail; human; measurement accuracy; patient coding; priority journal; radiology department; web browser; algorithm; Internet; organization and management; radiology department; radiology information system; standards"

Complex-software intense web-based information systems, with personal banking, retail marketing and retail sales evolved to online transactions and so did the need for secure information assurance to protect from illegal hacking. New electronics, computer technologies and software and system methodologies evolve to keep pace with military, aerospace, medical, human, manufacturing and cyber security requirements, system reliability evolve. In addition, shortened product development life-cycle in industry and the Department of Defense (DoD) went from three years to 18-months incorporating system reliability analysis and modeling for hardware, electronics, and software into the requirements, design, development, test and evaluation, and operations and support (O&S) sustainment phases. The challenge of technology evolution has increased the demand for systems to be built to meet reliability requirements and designed to meet the human need at least possible cost. Cost Estimation Model II (COCOMOII) estimates software engineering effort and cost of a software system based on source lines of code, engineering team capabilities, reliability and process maturity [1]. Cost Estimation System Engineering Model (COSYSMO) estimates system engineering effort and cost of a system based on system requirement counts, engineering team capabilities, reliability and process maturity.[1] Reliability and cost modeling for a continuous complex system using common reliability models, COCOMOII and COSYSMO, demonstrated a correlation between reliability with cost and process maturity with cost during developmental phases of the product lifecycle. The empirical reliability and developmental cost data analysis using COCOMOII and COSYSMO is recognized with limitations since the cost correlation, process maturity, reliability impact was built on only one system during developmental phases. Despite limited samples, these preliminary results indicate that it is possible to estimate developmental cost increase as a function of reliability improvements and developmental cost decrease as a function of process maturity. Additional research and analysis should be done to replicate the analysis. Since these COCOMOII and COSYSMO do not estimate effort and cost during the O&S phase, an O&S cost model was provided to demonstrate the correlation of system and software cost to reliability for an evaluation of total ownership costs (TOC) and return on investment. To model total TOC which includes O&S costs, the Army Logistics Support Activity Cost Analysis Strategy Assessment (CASA) model was run on Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Global Hawk UAV, MH-60S Fleet Combat Support Helicopter, CH-47F Improved Cargo Helicopter, and Force XXI Battle Command, and Brigade-And-Below (FBCB2) systems [2]. The CASA model estimates TOC for the entire life-cycle of a system, implemented by Navy, Army, Air Force, NASA, U.S. Coast Guard, and Marines. The CASA model with the five systems established a relationship between achieved reliability improvement and reduction in O&S cost. The empirical reliability, investment, and O&S data analysis is recognized with limitations since the reliability investment and reliability impact was built on only five systems. Additional research and analysis should be done to replicate the analysis. Despite limited samples, these preliminary results indicate that it is possible to estimate O&S cost reductions as a function of reliability investment and reliability improvements. This is significant since O&S costs account for over two-Thirds of the TOC [3]. Further research can be done to evaluate process maturity impact on the entire acquisition life-cycle TOC. It is also recognized that the applicability of the results may be limited to the specific systems under evaluation, although this data are typical of those for mission critical systems comprised of hardware and software. Further research is necessary to determine whether the results are applicable to systems in general or better specified to particular types of systems. Whether the results would be applicable to other DoD or commercial systems could only be determined by additional research. © 2016 IEEE.","Cost Correlation to Reliability; O&S Costs; Software Reliability; System Reliability","Computer hardware; Cost engineering; Cost estimating; Cost reduction; Costs; Crashworthiness; Data handling; Electronics industry; Fleet operations; Function evaluation; Hardware; Helicopters; Information analysis; Investments; Life cycle; Maintainability; Military helicopters; Military vehicles; NASA; Online systems; Personal computing; Product design; Reconfigurable hardware; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Requirements engineering; Sales; Software engineering; Software reliability; Software testing; Systems engineering; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); World Wide Web; Combat support helicopters; Cost correlations; Mission critical systems; Product development life cycles; Reliability improvement; Reliability requirements; System reliability; Web based information systems; Cost benefit analysis"

In company situations, they are utilized as a channel to communicate with their customers. However, studies examining how SMA have been utilized in the Business-to-Business (Social Media Benchmarking Report, 2014) context are lacking. Using a model based on Media Synchronicity Theory (MST), we present one of the first empirical studies investigating the relationship between the capabilities of SMA (transmission velocity, parallelism, symbol sets, rehearsability, and reprocessability) and B2B communication and business performance. Five case studies based on face-to-face interviews with the senior managers/owners of SME (Small and Medium Enterprises) were conducted.

Distributed architectures, especially those supported by virtualization and cloud computing, along with other emerging technologies such as Game-based Learning (GBL), currently are a hot trend in educational and professional fields. Around this idea, a key is the concept of educational piece as meaning an element of instructional design where is including a suitable game. Therefore, each piece is characterized. These points among others allow us to plan the game-based lab design and to determine most appropriate time for each learning activity. Eventually, a game-piece-based architecture is able to deploy a kind of laboratories on cybersecurity and critical infrastructures, but that can be generalized for educational activities in other fields. This method provides a coherent reasoning to learning objectives and enough flexibility within a teaching program. In order to get a consistent and effective overcome, a laboratory implementation requires nowadays communication systems, hosts, some virtualization or cloud services, particularly for remote learning, but even for improving the traditional computer classrooms. © 2016 IEEE.","Critical infrastructures; Cybersecurity; Distributed architecture; GBL; Virtualization","Computer games; Distributed computer systems; Education computing; Laboratories; Public works; Teaching; Virtual reality; Cyber security; Distributed architecture; Educational activities; Emerging technologies; Infrastructure protection; Instructional designs; Traditional computers; Virtualizations; Critical infrastructures"

For the problem of curve excessive shifted, a new method of curve alignment is proposed, whose name is bimodal correlation alignment method. The method effectively controls the curve excessive shift, and also achieves a precise alignment result. It is proposed to use independent component analysis (ICA) to select valid points. By the method of ICA, unknown source signals are obtained from electromagnetic leakage curves for classification analysis. ICA, principal components analysis(PCA), ICA-PCA, and PCA-ICA are adopted for dimensionality reduction. The classification result is got by support vector machine (SVM). It shows that success rate of ICA and PCA-ICA grows rapidly with the increase of the dimensions. PCA-ICA is the best, ICA is better, whice the worst is ICA-PCA, in the dimensionality 10 to 100.In the dimensionality 100 to 900, the success rate grows mostly like a line with the increase of the dimension.

The relevance of that problem is driven by the intensifying IT development and globalization, under which both information security of a separate state and international information security may not be achieved by the efforts of a single state. Efforts need to be consolidated, and a uniform approach to the solution of that matter needs to be worked out. The author stresses that in the Russian Federation and in most foreign countries there is no systematic approach to criminal law protection of information security except for the Republic of Poland. In most foreign criminal codes (CC), the provisions on information security protection are spread all over Special parts. In most foreign countries, offences against confidentiality of professional and official secrets are criminalized, while in the Civil Code of the RF such provisions are missing. Meantime, foreign criminal law does not specify separate elements of crimes in order to protect tax secrets. Criminal law protection of state secret is solved differently in foreign countries: via detailed regulation for state secret offences and under totally missing respective provisions in CC. Regarding cybercrime, the CIS countries used to apply the uniform approach to criminalization of respective elements of crime as criminal laws of most of them adopted the provisions of Model Criminal Code of the CIS member states. However, in future, due to the amendments of articles providing for liability for cybercrime that approach was lost. In foreign countries, along with the traditional illegal access to computer information, the liability is provided for computer sabotage, computer fraud. The author opines that a systematic approach is required to criminal law protection both in the Russian Federation and in foreign countries. Only uniform, joint, consolidated acts may efficiently serve to fight information security offences. © Marina Aleksandrovna Efremova, 2016.","Computerized information; Criminal law; Information; Information resource; Information security; Secret",""

In this paper, we present a novel 8-bit architecture for Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption which supports keys of 128-bit in length. The proposed architecture consists of a single round of ShiftRows, ByteSubstitution, MixColumns and AddRoundKey operations through which the data is iterated for ten rounds, which results in substantial reduction in terms of area and power consumption. We have proposed a new architecture for ByteSubstitution and AddRoundKey operations by employing high order masking and a different key expansion algorithm respectively, hence making the proposed architecture less vulnerable to Differential Power Analysis (DPA) and saturation attacks. Moreover, we have also utilized a new architecture for ShiftRows operation for further minimizing the area on chip. The proposed architecture was implemented on Virtex-7 FPGA using two different implementation strategies-Performance Explore and Area Explore using Vivado Design Suite. Using performance explore strategy, the proposed architecture worked at the maximum frequency of 200.32 MHz with a throughput of 160.26 Mbps, whereas, with area explore strategy, the proposed architecture utilized 662 slices, 796 LUTs and 0.303 Watt in power. © 2015 IEEE.","Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); Enhanced Key Expansion Algorithm; Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA); High Order Masking; Rolled Architecture","Data privacy; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Low power electronics; Network architecture; Reconfigurable hardware; Security of data; Side channel attack; Advanced Encryption Standard; Cryptographic algorithms; Differential power Analysis; High-order; Implementation strategies; Key expansion; Proposed architectures; Substantial reduction; Cryptography"

However, there are lots of obstacles to implement enterprise-wide information security activity and top management commitment seems to be insufficient as a key player. In this situation, participating information security committee can be a good way to vitalize the commitment of top management and its activities are essential for implementing information security governance. However, rarely study a role of information security committee even information security governance has been studied extensively. The purpose of this research is to identify roles of information security committee as an exploratory study. For comprehensive and theoretical study, we derive 4 dimensions from Quinn’s Competing Values Framework (CVF) that provides analytic methodology and then we identify 8 roles of information security committee related to the dimensions through literature review. The result is discussed by Focus Group Interview (FGI) which organized 4 specialists in the field of information security to accept their opinion in terms of real business experience and finally, we propose 10 roles of information security committee adjusted the opinions. © 2016, ICIC International.","Competing Values Framework; Information security committee; Information security governance","Computer science; Technology; Competing values frameworks; Corporate governance; Critical issues; Exploratory studies; Information security governance; Literature reviews; Theoretical study; Top management commitment; Security of data"

While management views risk along these dimensions, the information technology function (ITF) typically views risk from an IT infrastructure compromise viewpoint, and this drives the establishment of IT security controls. It is oftentimes difficult for the internal audit function (IAF) to assess control deficiency risk (CDR) in the area of information security, as well as estimate the importance of each in-place security control. Using a design science approach, we propose the Operational, Public image, Legal (OPL) model and method to classify the security criticality of the organization's data along three dimensions.

We conclude that although information technology is of wide usage, the information security topics need to be taught to prevent them from becoming victims of cyber crime. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","computer literacy; Cyber crime; information security awareness; Kyrgyz Republic","Computers; Crime; Risk perception; Security of data; Students; Computer literacy; Cyber-crimes; Education field; Information security awareness; Information society; Kyrgyz Republic; Research studies; Risk awareness; Computer crime"

Literature documents the existence of many online Internet Relay Chat (IRC) cybercriminal communities where cybercriminals congregate and share hacking tools, malware, and more. However, many cybercriminal community participants appear unskilled and have fleeting interests, making it difficult to detect potential long-term or key participants. This is a challenge for researchers and practitioners to quickly identify cybercriminals that may provide credible threat intelligence. Thus, we propose a computational approach to analyze cybercriminals IRC communities in order to identify potential long-term and key participants. We use the extended Cox model to scrutinize cybercriminal IRC participation for better understanding of behaviors exhibited by cybercriminals of importance. Results indicate that key cybercriminals may be quickly identifiable by assessing the scale of their interaction and networks with other participants.

Current approaches for validating and integrating cyber defenses heavily rely on manual trial-and-error, without a clear and systematic understanding of security versus cost tradeoffs. Recent work on model-based analysis of cyber defeses has led to quantitative measures of the attack surface of a distributed system hosting mission critical applications. These metrics show great promise, but the cost of manually creating the underlying models is an impediment to their wider adoption. This paper describes an experimentation framework for automating multiple activities associated with model construction and validation, including creating ontological system models from real systems, measuring and recording distributions of resource impact and end-to-end performance overhead values, executing real attacks to validate theoretic attack vectors found through analytic reasoning, and creating and managing multi-variable experiments. © 2016 ACM.","Cyber security analysis; Cyber test range; Modeling; Threat assessment","Models; Security of data; Cyber security; End-to-end performance; Information assurance; Mission critical applications; Model-based analysis; Quantitative measures; Test range; Threat assessment; Costs"

The projected outcome of this examination is a better understanding of the sophistication required in protecting the vital privacy constraints of an individual’s Protected Health Information (PHI). In understanding the implications of protecting healthcare data in today’s technological world, the scope of this paper is to grasp an overview of confidentiality as it pertains to information security. In addressing this topic, a high level overview of the three goals of information security are examined; in particular, the goal of confidentiality is the primary focus. Expanding upon the goal of confidentiality, healthcare accessibility legal aspects are considered, with a focus upon the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

Secure information transfer can be achieved by cryptography and steganography. Cryptography is a tool that provides encryption techniques for secure communication. Steganography is the technique of hiding information by way of the message of the picture, so that in addition to the person addressed, another person will not be aware of the existence of the message. In this study the issues to be discussed is the technique of message encryption with RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman) method. Messages are encrypted after compressed by LZW (Lempel Ziv Welch) method, so it will reduce the size of the message that will be inserted and increase the capacity of messages that can be inserted. Messages that have been compressed and encrypted, is then hidden by DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) techniques. With the incorporation of encryption techniques, steganography, and compression, the acquired information is more secure and its capacity is larger. For a 512x512 colored image there are 1536 characters enable for hiding. With LZW the amount of characters hiding will be about twice larger in this research. © 2015 IEEE.","compression; cryptography; encryption; LZW; RSA; steganography","Compaction; Discrete cosine transforms; Electronic data interchange; Security of data; Steganography; Wireless telecommunication systems; Colored images; Encryption technique; Hiding informations; Information transfers; Large amounts of data; Message encryption; Rivest-shamir-adleman; RSA encryption; Cryptography"

Previously, information security issues were studied in a technological context, but growing security needs have extended researchers' attention to explore the management role in information security management. Various studies have explored different management roles and activities, but none has given a comprehensive picture of these roles and activities to manage information security effectively. So it is necessary to accumulate knowledge about various managerial roles and activities from literature to enable managers to adopt these for a more holistic approach to information security management. In this paper, using a systematic literature review approach, we synthesised literature related to management's roles in information security to explore specific managerial activities to enhance information security management. We found that numerous activities of management, particularly development and execution of information security policy, awareness, compliance training, development of effective enterprise information architecture, IT infrastructure management, business and IT alignment and human resources management, had a significant impact on the quality of management of information security. Thus, this research makes a novel contribution by arguing that a more holistic approach to information security is needed and we suggest the ways in which managers can play an effective role in information security. This research also opens up many new avenues for further research in this area. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Business information architecture; Business IT alignment; Cloud computing; Information architecture; Information security; Information security policy; Management; Managerial practices; Systematic","Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Industrial management; Information retrieval; Management; Managers; Security of data; Security systems; Business - IT alignments; Business information; Information architectures; Information security policies; Managerial practices; Systematic; Information management"

Employers or other stakeholders may have a preference for certain outcomes, without being able to or having a desire to enforce a particular decision. In such situations, systems may build in design nudges to influence the decision making, e. g., by highlighting the employer's preferred solution. In this paper we model influencing information security to identify which approaches to influencing are most effective and how they can be optimized. To do so, we extend traditional multi-criteria decision analysis models with modifiable criteria, to represent the available approaches an influencer has for influencing the choice of the decision maker. The notion of influence power is introduced to characterize the extent to which an influencer can influence decision makers. We illustrate our approach using data from a controlled experiment on techniques to influence which public wireless network users select. This allows us to calculate influence power and identify which design nudges exercise the most influence over user decisions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This scheme maximizes the secure Energy Efficiency (EE) of the network by power allocation subject to the maximum power constraint of each node and the target secrecy rate constraint of the network. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm for power allocation is developed based on fractional programming, dual decomposition, and Difference of Convex functions (DC) programming. It is verified by simulations that the proposed algorithm can lead to a significant gain of secure EE yet with some loss of secrecy rate compared with secrecy rate maximization. This is because that there is an inherent tradeoff between EE and secrecy.

However, commercial firewalls, such as Juniper Networks and Cisco ASA firewall devices, are mainly designed to be used by networking and security professionals, are not very appropriate for the academia environment, and lack simplicity. In addition, commercial firewalls are usually considered high-cost hardware devices. However, academic institutions usually have tight budget and few financial resources for purchasing networking and security devices for their laboratories. To overcome the aforementioned limitation of commercial firewalls, an educational firewall hardware device, called Edu-Firewall, is discussed and demonstrated. Edu-Firewall main objectives are to offer advanced educational security functions that are not commonly available in current commercial firewalls, and an easy-to-use friendly graphical interface to configure the firewall and manipulate the filtering rules. In addition, Edu-Firewall's objective is to offer an affordable educational device, compared to the available commercial firewall devices. Edu-Firewall allows students to implement hands-on lab exercises on firewalls and better anatomize network traffic filtering concepts and firewall configuration, and contributes to enhance students' hands-on security skills. © 2016 IEEE.","Firewall; Information security education; Network packet filtering","Budget control; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Education; Hardware; Hardware security; Information filtering; Reconfigurable hardware; Security of data; Security systems; Students; Academic institutions; Financial resources; Firewall; Graphical interface; Information security education; Network packets; Security functions; Security professionals; Network security"

Traceback, a key cyber-forensics technology, can play an important role in tracing and locating a malicious source to guarantee cybersecurity. In this work a trust-based adaptive probability marking and storage (TAPMS) traceback scheme is proposed to enhance security for WSNs. In a TAPMS scheme, the marking probability is adaptively adjusted according to the security requirements of the network and can substantially reduce the number of marking tuples and improve network lifetime. More importantly, a high trust node is selected to store marking tuples, which can avoid the problem of marking information being lost. Experimental results show that the total number of marking tuples can be reduced in a TAPMS scheme, thus improving network lifetime. At the same time, since the marking tuples are stored in high trust nodes, storage reliability can be guaranteed, and the traceback time can be reduced by more than 80%. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Adaptive probability marking; Traceback; Trust; Wireless sensor network","Military applications; Network security; Probability; Sensor nodes; Adaptive probabilities; Commercial applications; Network lifetime; Security requirements; Storage reliability; Traceback; Trust; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks"

It is acknowledged that security awareness is the most important factor that mitigates the risk of information security breaches in organizations. In this research, a model has been presented that shows how information security knowledge sharing (ISKS) forms and decreases the risk of information security incidents. The Motivation Theory and Theory of Planned Behavior besides Triandis model were applied as the theoretical backbone of the conceptual framework. The results of the data analysis showed that earning a reputation, and gaining promotion as an extrinsic motivation and curiosity satisfaction as an intrinsic motivation have positive effects on employees' attitude toward ISKS. However, self-worth satisfaction does not influence ISKS attitude. In addition, the findings revealed that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms have positive effects on ISKS intention and ISKS intention affects ISKS behavior. The outcomes also showed that organizational support influences ISKS behavior more than trust.

The analytic hierarchy model of security assessment was established with the analysis of equipment in ICS and specific attacks. The FAHP method was implemented taking a typical chemical industrial control system for example. The principle of information security assessment was transferred to the principle of security assessment for ICS, and the rationality and logicality of the hierarchical modeling for ICS was improved. The proposed assessment established an analytic hierarchy model, introducing fuzzy consistent matrix and making the step of FAHP. According to the attack method, the sub goal security value was calculated with fuzzy comprehensive evaluation using unified assessment set in order to determine the vulnerability of ICS. The vulnerability of ICS refers to the vulnerable equipment in ICS. Then the overall security situation for ICS was obtained. The assessment results show that the vulnerable equipment in this ICS is engineer station and PLC, which need highly protective measures in particular.

Mobile device adoption into practice is a recent trend that has increased dramatically and formal studies are needed to investigate consequent benefits and challenges. The objective of this study is to evaluate practitioner perceptions of improvements in productivity, provider-patient communications, care provision, technology usability and other outcomes following the adoption and use of a tablet computer connected to electronic health information resources. Methods: A pilot program was initiated in June 2013 to evaluate the effect of mobile tablet computers at one health provider organization in the southeast United States. Providers were asked to volunteer for the evaluation and were each given a mobile tablet computer. A total of 42 inpatient and outpatient providers were interviewed in 2015 using a survey style questionnaire that utilized yes/no, Likert-style, and open ended questions. Each had previously used an electronic health record (EHR) system a minimum of one year outside of residency, and were regular users of personal mobile devices. Each used a mobile tablet computer in the context of their practice connected to the health system EHR. Results: The survey results indicate that more than half of providers perceive the use of the tablet device as having a positive effect on patient communications, patient education, patient's perception of the provider, time spent interacting with patients, provider productivity, process of care, satisfaction with EHR when used together with the device, and care provision. Providers also reported feeling comfortable using the device (82.9%), would recommend the device to colleagues (69.2%), did not experience increased information security and privacy concerns (95%), and noted significant reductions in EHR login times (64.1%). Less than 25% of participants reported negative impacts on any of these areas as well as on time spent on order submission, note completion time, overall workload, patient satisfaction with care experience and patient outcomes. Gender, number of years in practice, practice type (general practitioner vs. specialist), and service type (inpatient/outpatient) were found to have a significant effect on perceptions of patient satisfaction, care process, and provider productivity. Conclusions: Providers found positive gains from utilizing mobile devices in overall productivity, improved communications with their patients, the process of care, and technology efficiencies when used in combination with EHR and other health information resources.

However, the steganalysis in the real world is done with different levels of such knowledge so that there can be various paradigms for doing it. Although some researchers have addressed the situations, there is still a lack of a systematic approach to defining the various paradigms. In this paper, the authors give such an approach by first defining four extreme paradigms, and then defining the rest among them. Each paradigm is related with two sets of assumed known a priori knowledge respectively about the steganographic algorithm and cover-media, and each paradigm corresponds to a particular case of steganalysis. Also we will see that different paradigms can have very different aims so that the designs may be various.

This is because mobile phones are like a necessity to many people nowadays. Statistics have shown that more than seven billion people in the world are having these devices in 2015. This also means 97% of the human world populations are actually mobile phone users. Besides, more than 50% of the mobile phone users are using smarts phones which are capable of downloading a lot of mobile application systems (apps). It is estimated that more than 200 million apps are being downloaded in 2007 and this number is believed to be growing. Unfortunately, many of these apps involve the transfer of important and confidential personal data or business information. How to ensure this sensitive information is well protected from being stolen or misused by unauthorized parties? One of the ways to secure this communication is to properly control the access to the system by strengthening the user authentication. Thus, this paper focuses on one the techniques to enhance the protections of mobile apps to prevent intrusions by unpermitted users. The enhancement is focusing on improving the multi-factor elements and the text ciphering technique of the user authentication. In this study, random number and time are added in the existing text-based multifactor user authentication. Besides, encryption and hash are used as the text ciphering technique to improve the protection. To measure how secure the proposed enhancement is, an independent testing body has been appointed to perform Vulnerability Test and Functionality Test to the apps. If all these tests are passed, it can be said that the proposed enhancement is strong enough to protect the apps from being intruded. Based on the test results provided by the testing body, CyberSecurity Malaysia, the apps has passed all the Vulnerability Test and Functionality Test. This shows that the control of the access to these apps are strong and able to prevent from being accessed by unpermitted users. This also means the proposed enhancement is able to give better protections to ensure the mobile apps can't be easily broken into by unauthorized mobile phone users. © 2005 - 2016 JATIT & LLS.

In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) digital watermarking has become a new hotspot in optical information security. This paper presents a new improved security 3D digital watermarking method based on computational integrated imaging cryptosystem. Firstly, 3D digital watermarking is generated and encrypted by computational integral imaging cryptosystem that is implemented with smart pseudoscopic-to-orthoscopic conversion (SPOC) model. Secondly, discrete wavelet transform algorithm is applied to embed and extract the 3D digital watermarking. Finally, the extracted watermark is decrypted, and3D digital watermarking is displayed by integral imaging system. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiment. A primary implication of encrypted processing is that the majority of integral imaging cryptosystem will be encryption-in-the-loop applications, and the majority of system will improve the security and robustness of 3D digital watermarking. The new method is able to meet the requirements of robustness and security. Image quality and display quality achieve these criterions of the human visual model. The proposed method can be applied in the aspects of cloud computing and big data.

However, this can be a considerable burden because their resources are often limited. This paper introduces a technique and system architecture that monitor the vulnerability of the IT assets on an organization's administrative networks. We use open information and standardized, non-proprietary tools in order to bolster cybersecurity capability for a wide range of organizations. In the proposed system, an agent module installed on each IT asset sends information to its server, while the server also probes the network to collect information on agentless IT assets. The server then converts the information into standard identifiers, which are used to query open repositories to obtain vulnerability information. The system provides an alert when vulnerability information pertaining to the IT asset is identified. This paper also introduces a prototype system, with which we analyze and discuss the proposed technique and system and clarify issues to be solved in our future work. © 2016 IEEE.","","Ubiquitous computing; Cyber security; IT assets; Open repositories; Prototype system; System architectures; Information use"

One of the methods to ensure information integrity is the use of hash functions, which generates a stream of bytes (hash) that must be unique. But most functions can no longer prevent malicious attacks and ensure that the information have just a hash. Because of the weakening of the widely used SHA-1 hash algorithm and concerns over the similarly-structured algorithms of the SHA-2 family, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated the SHA-3 contest in order to select a suitable drop-in replacement.

We must all protect our critical cyber assets with antivirus as North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) CIP-007 R4 states, but more broadly, we must protect our assets from malicious code infection regardless of whether they are identified as critical assets or not. Embedded devices and traditional personnel computer devices should be protected. The Stuxnet worm demonstrated that air gaps and unplugged devices are not immune from infection. We must engineer devices and systems to protect against the impact of malware. Traditionally, this protection was accomplished by using blacklist technology, where the technology watched for known bad code and blocked it. This resulted in a race to update malware protection technology when new threats were discovered, before infection happened. With malware statistics topping 83 million pieces of code, based on the August 2014 McAfee Labs Threats Report, and growing every day, the administrative task is impossible to keep up with. This design also can put excessive burden on processors, slowing computations and communications. New malware protection technology is designed using a whitelist architecture that only allows known good code to execute on the device. This simplifies administrative overhead because new updates are not needed when new malware is released. A control system environment is built with application-specific devices that are set to accomplish one or more tasks and left alone to continue accomplishing the same tasks for many years, setting a perfect stage for whitelist malware protection technology. This paper investigates the benefits that whitelist malware protection provides at the application layer (similar to existing anti-malware technology) and explains why embedded devices need architecture-specific malware protection. The paper shows that correctly combining malware protection and embedded architecture improves the reliability and cost of ownership of the whole system. The paper also highlights the enhanced security that whitelist malware protection provides over traditional solutions and how these principles apply to computers and embedded devices. The paper shows how whitelist malware protection meets and exceeds the NERC CIP requirements in Versions 3 and 5. © 2015 IEEE.","control system; cybersecurity; enhanced security; whitelist malware protection","Codes (symbols); Computer crime; Control systems; Electric power transmission networks; Smart power grids; Administrative tasks; Application specific; Cyber security; Embedded architecture; Embedded control systems; enhanced security; Protection technologies; whitelist malware protection; Malware"

Using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and testing hypotheses, the study finds that information security policy has significant indirect influence on information security compliance. The effect of security policy is fully mediated by security roles and responsibilities, operations security activities, and security monitoring and review activities. Security policy strongly influences operations security activities and has the greatest effect on security roles and responsibilities. Among the three mediating variables, monitoring and reviews has the most significant influence on security compliance. Conversely, the impact of security policy on compliance is not significant.

However, effective configuration (training and tuning) is critical for deployment of such schemes in practice. As network traffic may shift over time, the ability to perform fast reconfiguration is needed to provide the level of security necessary for future applications.

In the case of the South Carolina DoR the credentials of an employee were compromised by an external entity. The intruders then further compromised other parts of the network in order to find potentially profitable data and began the exfiltration of information from within the network. In this paper we will present the concept of a Honey Community that provides a means for alerting local and state communities and large organizations when they are under attack.

In this paper, we apply the meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on 8-round mCrypton-96, which improves the best MITM attack result on mCrypton-96 by 1 round. When analyzing the security of block ciphers, using key relations to reduce the time complexity, memory complexity and data complexity is a common method. From the property of the key schedule of mCrypton-96, we know that each round key could calculate some information of the internal register by the algebraic structure of the key schedule, and some round keys could be deduced from the other round keys. By using the relationship of key schedule and the properties of S-box, we present a MITM attack on 8-round mCrypton-96 based on the 4-round distinguisher by adding 1 round on the top and 3 rounds at the bottom. The time, memory and data complexities of the attack are 293.5 encryptions, 247 B and 257 chosen plaintexts respectively. It is illustrated that mCrypton-96 not only has an efficient performance but also possesses strong security. © 2016, Science Press.

Two closely related pricing cyberattacks which manipulate the guideline electricity prices received at smart meters are considered and they aim at reducing the expense of the cyberattacker and increasing the peak energy usage in the local community. A single event detection technique which uses support vector regression and impact difference for detecting anomaly pricing is proposed. The detection capability of such a technique is still limited since it does not model the long term impact of pricing cyberattacks. This motivates us to develop a partially observable Markov decision process based detection algorithm, which has the ingredients such as reward expectation and policy transfer graph to account for the cumulative impact and the potential future impact due to pricing cyberattacks. Our simulation results demonstrate that the pricing cyberattack can reduce the cyberattacker's bill by 34.3 percent at cost of the increase of others' bill by 7.9 percent, and increase the peak to average ratio (PAR) by 35.7 percent. Furthermore, the proposed long term detection technique has the detection accuracy of more than 97 percent with significant reduction in PAR and bill compared to repeatedly using the single event detection technique. © 2015 IEEE.","Advanced Metering Infrastructure; Cybersecurity; Electricity Pricing Manipulation; Partially Observable Markov Decision Process; Smart Home","Advanced metering infrastructures; Automation; Electric power measurement; Energy utilization; Markov processes; Power markets; Cyber security; Detection capability; Electricity pricing; Electricity pricing model; Partially observable Markov decision process; Peak to average ratios; Smart homes; Support vector regression (SVR); Costs"

Without strong security measures information can be accessed by any attacker very easily. In this modern world, there are many attacking techniques for accessing others information or to block the path so that no one can access information. One of the most common and popular attack is DDOS [Distributed Denial Of Service] attack, in which attacker blocks the path to access information or any site by sending enormous amount of request to the server. In this research, a proposed algorithm is used to get information about which IP address or attacker attacking to the system. This proposed algorithm will check which IP address or client requested the information more than 3 times or less? If for any IP address or client it is yes, then server will deny for accessing information i.e.""Access Denied"" for that individual IP or client. Then from that blocked IP address, we get the location of attacker and also get to know from which port number request is processed. If users itself address is there on that port then that is a real attacker or hacker else that was not users own IP, then that system is daemon system i.e. some other IP address controlling the system and attacking. Then IP Address on that port is traced to get the information or IP of actual hacker. © 2016 ACM.","Daemon Framework; DDOS; Enable Ports; IP Tracing; Penetration Testing","Network security; Personal computing; Security of data; Daemon Framework; DDOS; Enable Ports; IP Tracing; Penetration testing; Denial-of-service attack"

This has resulted in promoting outsourcing of work by clients to vendors. Most of the published research has focussed on when clients should start outsourcing, what to outsource, criteria for vendor selection, etc., however the vendor side of the relationship has been mostly ignored. The purpose of this paper is to delve deep into the vendors’ side and what aspects a vendor needs to consider in order to maintain a good relationship with the clients. Design/methodology/approach – The research design of the paper is to use literature survey to define the components of the client vendor relationship (CVR), identify the parameters impacting the relationship, establish correlation between the independent variables and the dependent variable; subsequently to propose a framework for the CVR. Findings – The findings have been that – communication, technical value addition, knowledge sharing and client vendor adaptability are vital to any outsourcing engagement and if the vendor is able to get good knowledge transfer of the application at hand and the business domain, it can perform better. Vendors, which proactively resolve issues, ensure stable deliveries before time and identify improvements in the software outside the work assigned maintain better relationship. Further a vendor must be adaptable to clients, cultural, time zone differences, should provide a good project manager and be ready to change tools, resources as per client needs. As long as the vendor is able to ensure the above, the stability of the client country and need for information security is not as important to vendors. Research limitations/implications – The study has limitations as it focusses on the vendors’ side and is inclined toward Indian vendors’ perspectives. Future research can include client as well and can be conducted for a different geography. Originality/value – The research work is original and adds value to the IT service outsourcing industry by identifying the parameters which need to be monitored for a sustainable CVR. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Client; Client vendor relationship; Information technology service outsourcing; Vendor",""

The retail industry is vulnerable to human inflicted breaches due to the fact that hackers rely on their victims' lack of security awareness, knowledge and understanding, security behavior and the organization's inadequate security measures for protecting itself and its clients. The true level of security in technology and processes relies on the people involved in the use and implementation thereof [1]. Therefore, the implementation of IS requires three elements namely: human factors, organizational aspects and technological controls [2]. All three of these elements have the common feature of human intervention and therefore security gaps are inevitable. Each element also functions as both security control and security vulnerability. The paper addresses these elements and identifies the human aspect of each through current and extant literature which spawns new human-security elements. The purpose of this research is to provide evidence that the IT sector of the South African retail industry is vulnerable to the human factor as a result of the disregard for human-security elements. The research points out that the IT sector of the South African retail industry is lacking trust and does not pay adequate attention to security awareness and awareness regarding security accountability. Furthermore, the IT sector of the South African retail industry is lacking: 1) IS policies, 2) process and procedure documentation for creating visibility, and 3) transparency necessary to promote trust. These findings provide support that the identified gaps, either directly or indirectly, relate to trust, and therefore, might be major contributing factors to the vast number of breaches experienced in the South African retail industry. These findings may also provide valuable insight into combatting the human factor of IS within the IT sector, irrespective of industry, which choose to follow an IS model built on the foundation of trust. © 2015 IEEE.","ability; acceptance; accountability; benevolence; collaboration; communication; human factor; integrity; knowledge; management workflows; organizational aspects; policies; procedures; retail industry; security awareness; social engineering; technological controls; training; transparency; trust; trust factors; understanding; visibility","Communication; Human engineering; Knowledge management; Personal computing; Personnel training; Public policy; Sales; Security of data; Transparency; Visibility; ability; acceptance; accountability; benevolence; collaboration; integrity; knowledge; Organizational aspects; procedures; Retail industry; Security awareness; Social engineering; trust; Trust factor; understanding; Work-flows; Costs"

The network topology information is very important for system operators to manage the grid in a secure manner. However, this network topology can be manipulated by an adversary through the change of the circuit breaker's on/off status. This, combined with virtual bids submitted by the attackers, could lead to financial misconduct and potential profit for the attacker in the power market. This paper aims at developing an analytical framework to evaluate the economic profit of an attacker who conducts topology data attack and submits virtual bids accordingly. This framework can be used for system operators as a cybersecurity tool to quickly find the most profitable pair of virtual bidding buses and the most influential transmission line on the change in profit once topology data attack is initiated. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the adversary's profit with respect to the change in generator's marginal cost and susceptance for any targeted line is assessed in the proposed framework.

However, determining how to include diversity in a system without increasing the attack surface more than necessary is a difficult problem, requiring knowledge about the system characteristics, operating environment, and available permutations that is generally not available prior to system deployment. We propose viewing a system's components, interfaces, and communication channels as a set of states and actions that can be analyzed using a sequential decision making process, and using a multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a set of policies that minimize a system's attack surface and execute those policies to obtain configuration diversity while a system is operating. We describe a methodology for designing a system such that its components and behaviors can be translated into a multi-objective Markov Decision Process, demonstrate the use of multi-objective reinforcement learning to learn a set of optimal policies using three different multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithms in the context of an online file sharing application, and show that our multi-objective temporal difference afterstate algorithm outperforms the alternatives for the example problem. © 2015 IEEE.","Cybersecurity; Moving target defense; Multi-objective reinforcement learning","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Decision making; Electronic document exchange; Interface states; Learning systems; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Cyber security; File sharing application; Markov Decision Processes; Moving target defense; Multi objective; Operating environment; Sequential decision making; System characteristics; Learning algorithms"

In this context, the Content-based Protection and Release (CPR) model has been introduced to support the specification and enforcement of access control policies used in NATO and, more generally, in complex organizations. While the ability to support fine-grained security policies for a large variety of users, resources and devices is desirable, the definition, maintenance, and enforcement of these policies can be diffcult, time-consuming, and error-prone. Thus, automated support for policy analysis to help designers in these activities is needed.

Analysis of literature on information security education and awareness indicates that approaches for enhancing end-users' security knowledge do exist, as do models for promoting organizational security knowledge in the industry domain. However, only one model was found to exist for enhancing security knowledge of employees in the institutions domain. This paper therefore describes a gap identified in the existing information security education and awareness models and presents the required relevant characteristics for developing information security education and awareness models for bridging the gap (in the institutions domain). The paper also evaluates and compares characteristics of existing models in order to identify the most relevant characteristics for a new model and makes a presentation to that effect.

PoL-DFA symbolically analyzes every instruction in the execution trace of a process to keep track of the data flows among program objects (e.g., integers, structures, arrays), and concatenates these pieces of data flows to obtain the overall data flow graph of the execution. We leverage PoLDFA to identify malicious data flows in data leakage and contamination forensics. In two mocked digital forensic scenarios, for data leakage and contamination respectively, we tested the ability of PoL-DFA to identify data flows among multiple inputs and outputs of server programs. Our results show that PoL-DFA can accurately determine whether the data (or the processed results) from a source file or socket flow to a certain output channel. Based on this information, security administrators can pinpoint the path of data leakage or data contamination. Different from existing dynamic DFA techniques that require excessive amount of instrumentation, PoL-DFA only requires logging the execution traces of the processes being monitored. The measured performance overhead for server programs is 4.24%, on average. The results indicate PoL-DFA is a lightweight DFA solution for data leakage and contamination forensics. © 2016 ACM.","","Application programs; Contamination; Data flow analysis; Data flow graphs; Data transfer; Flow graphs; Graphic methods; Integer programming; Digital forensic; Execution trace; Keep track of; Multiple inputs and outputs; Output channels; Security administrator; Server programs; Source files; Data privacy"

Currently, the most used and standardized algorithm is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), but the encryption and decryption usually causes undesired delays in the access to information. As users must necessarily use either AES or another encryption/decryption algorithm to guarantee confidentiality, the implications on performance must always be evaluated. It is very interesting to evaluate the influence of the configuration parameters of AES on performance, in order to select an appropriate configuration.

Research efforts, however, are impeded by the lack of data that integrate both types of systems. This paper presents an empirical analysis of malicious activities aimed at integrated ICS and ES environment using the dataset created and released by the SANS Institute. The contributions of our work include classification of the observed malicious activities according to several criteria, such as the number of steps (i.e., single-step vs. multi-step), targeted technology (i.e., ICS, ES or both), types of cyber-probes and cyberattacks (e.g., port scan, vulnerability scan, information disclosure, code injection, and SQL injection), and protocols used. In addition, we quantified the severity of the attacks' impact on systems. The main empirical findings include: (1) More sophisticated multi-step attacks which leveraged multiple vulnerabilities had higher success rate and led to more severe consequences than single-step attacks, (2) Most malicious cyber activities targeted the embedded servers running on ICS devices rather than the ICS protocols. Specifically, cyber activities based only on ICS protocols accounted for a mere 2% of the total malicious traffic. We conclude the paper with a description of a sample of cybersecurity controls that could have prevented or weakened most of the observed attacks. © 2016 IEEE.","Attack characterization; Enterprise system security; Industrial control system security; SCADA testbed; Severity","Control systems; Enterprise resource planning; Industrial research; Systems engineering; Empirical findings; Enterprise system; Industrial control systems; Industrial controls; Information disclosure; Malicious activities; Severity; Vulnerability scans; Intelligent control"

Design/methodology/approach – A case study was conducted in a financial institution. In all, 24 employees were interviewed. These employees came from all functional areas and various positions, from tellers to executives. Interviews were conducted, internal policies and examiners’ reports were made available and access was given to observe the employees during working hours and to observe the facilities after hours. Findings – Executives were overly optimistic about the level of information security at their organization. These optimistic perceptions guided security priorities; however, the findings show that their perceptions were misguided leaving their organization open to increased security threats. More specifically, the results show that optimist perceptions by management can put an organization’s information at risk. Originality/value – The paper uses existing theory and evaluates it in a “real-world” setting. For security research, it can be difficult to get honest responses from questionnaires; however, the hands-on approach provided a deeper insight to the problem of optimistic perceptions in an organizational setting. For practitioners, the case can raise managements’ awareness of perceptional inaccuracies, resulting in more informed information security decisions and ultimately improved security for their organization. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Optimism, Perception, Organizational behavior, Information security",""

Deception does not require software to be loaded or maintained on the SCADA device, but instead, a deception solution confuses, delays, and redirects a cyberattack by incorporating ambiguity and misdirecting its operation. By design, deception will detect both reconnaissance and stolen credential attacks, and will reduce attack detection time by accurately identifying infected clients, including sleeper and time-triggered agents.

The most famous digital signature schemes are based on either the intractability of the integer factorization problem or the discrete logarithmic problem over finite fields. With Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer, these problems become tractable. Hence developments of signature schemes which are not based on these problems are crucial for maintaining information security. This paper introduces the conjugate twisted root extraction problem, and proposes a digital signature scheme based on a group of 2 × 2 matrices over N-truncated one variable polynomials. Its security relies on the cojugate twisted e-th root extraction problem. We prove that an adversary cannot forge a signature on a document unless the adversary extracts the e-th root in this group. The performance and other security issues are also discussed. © 2015 IEEE.","Conjugate twisted root extraction problem; digital signature; endomorphism; group; root extraction problem","Electronic document identification systems; Extraction; Factorization; Network security; Quantum computers; Security of data; Digital signature schemes; Discrete logarithmic problem; endomorphism; group; Integer factorization problem; Root extraction; Shor's algorithms; Signature Scheme; Authentication"

Findings: - Based on the results, it is argued that, although no strong conclusions could be made given the current data constraints, there was enough evidence to show that such correlation exists, especially for recurring security breaches. Research limitations/implications: - One of the main limitations of this study was the quantity and quality of published data on security breaches, as organisations tend not to share this information. Practical implications: - One of the challenges in information security management is assessing the wider economic impact of security breaches. Subsequently, this helps drive investment decisions on security programmes that are usually seen as cost rather than moneymaking initiatives.

Unlike previous partial assessments, this paper systematically applies ""offense-defense theory"" as previously developed by international relations theorists and historians. The preliminary analysis of this brief paper identifies several key distinct features of cyberspace relevant to the judgment. While concluding that most current factors point to offensive advantage in cyberspace, the analysis also indicates the limitations of evaluating only cyberspace factors. Within specified conditions, the state of the offense-defense balance can be critical to tactical and operational policy-making. But at the strategic level, the extensive interactions of cyber capabilities and other coercive means available to states necessitates evaluating how the advent of cyber technologies may be shifting balances of advantage between offense and defense in the military postures of states holistically.

So, it is important to understand the various risk factors that lead to distortion in information sharing and results in negative consequences. Information risk identification and assessment in supply chain would help in choosing right mitigation strategies. The purpose of this paper is to identify various information risks that could impact a supply chain, and develop a conceptual framework to quantify them. Design/methodology/approach – Bayesian belief network (BBN) modeling will be used to provide a framework for information risk analysis in a supply chain. Bayesian methodology provides the reasoning in causal relationship among various risk factors and incorporates both objective and subjective data. Findings – This paper presents a causal relationship among various information risks in a supply chain. Three important risk factors, namely, information security, information leakages and reluctance toward information sharing showed influence on a company’s revenue.

The latest battlefront is in the field where critical drilling and production assets are at risk of being disrupted or destroyed, thanks to their highly vulnerable control systems. To help drillers understand the wide spectrum of risks, Hilde Houmb is serving as the Cybersecurity Subcommittee Leader of the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) where she and a committee of nearly 50 others have created the first set of cybersecurity guidelines for drilling assets. As awareness of cyber threats builds throughout the industry, major oil and gas companies are bringing more security and information technology analysts into the board room. Philip Hurslton, the leader of the oil and gas special interest group at InfraGard in Houston, a not-for-profit organization funded by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, bills itself as a partnership for protection that opens the lines of communication between the agency and industries the government considers to be responsible for the country's critical infrastructure. To encourage industry stakeholders to provide threat intelligence, InfraGard members can report attacks anonymously, which then allows the FBI to warn other companies that might suffer from the same attacks.","","Crime; Infill drilling; Network security; Nonprofit organization; Petroleum industry; Public utilities; Drilling contractors; Federal bureau of investigations; Industry stakeholders; International Association; Oil and gas companies; Oil and Gas Industry; Production assets; Special interest groups; Gas industry"

Advanced technologies have made mobile banking services easy to use, attractive and beneficial. While this is welcome news to many, there are concerns that when lead-users tinker with these services, information security risks are exacerbated. The aim of this article is to present an insightful understanding of the demand-side predilections of South Africa's lead-users in such contexts. We assimilate the theories of Usage Control, (UCON), the Theory of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the Theory of Perceived Risk (TPP) to explain predilections over technology. We demonstrate that constructs derived from these theories can explain the general demand-side predilection to tinker with mobile banking services. A quantitative approach was used to test this. From a sample of South African banking lead-users operating in Gauteng province of South Africa, data was collected and analysed with the help of a software package. We found unexpectedly that, lead-users predilections to tinker with mobile banking services was inhibited by perceived risk. Moreover, male lead-users were more domineering in the tinkering process than female lead-users. The implication for this is discussed and explained in the main body of work. © 2015 IEEE.","Information Security Risk; Lead-users; Mobile banking; Predilections; Tinker","Security of data; Information security risks; Lead users; Mobile bankings; Predilections; Tinker; Cellular telephone systems"

It is therefore necessary to persuade users to practice good computer security. This interview analysis of users’ conceptualization of security password guessing attacks, antivirus protection, and mobile online privacy shows that poor understanding of security threats influences users’ motivation and ability to practice safe behaviors. An online interactive comic series called Secure Comics was designed and developed based on instructional design principles to address this problem. An eye-tracking experiment suggests that the graphical and interactive components of the comics direct users’ attention and facilitate comprehension of the information. In the evaluations of Secure Comics, results from several user studies show that the comics improve understanding and motivate positive changes in security management behavior. The implication of the findings to better understand the role of instructional design and persuasion in education technology are discussed.

Advocacy for defense-in-depth and diverse security measures has contributed to creating this «more is better» mentality for defending computer systems which fails to consider the complex interaction of different components in these systems, especially with regard to what impact new security controls may have the operation and functionality of other, pre-existing defenses.

The advantages of clinical decision support system include not only improving diagnosis accuracy but also reducing diagnosis time. Specifically, with large amounts of clinical data generated everyday, naïve Bayesian classification can be utilized to excavate valuable information to improve a clinical decision support system. Although the clinical decision support system is quite promising, the flourish of the system still faces many challenges including information security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving patient-centric clinical decision support system, which helps clinician complementary to diagnose the risk of patients' disease in a privacy-preserving way. In the proposed system, the past patients' historical data are stored in cloud and can be used to train the naïve Bayesian classifier without leaking any individual patient medical data, and then the trained classifier can be applied to compute the disease risk for new coming patients and also allow these patients to retrieve the top-k disease names according to their own preferences. Specifically, to protect the privacy of past patients' historical data, a new cryptographic tool called additive homomorphic proxy aggregation scheme is designed. Moreover, to leverage the leakage of naïve Bayesian classifier, we introduce a privacy-preserving top-k disease names retrieval protocol in our system. Detailed privacy analysis ensures that patient's information is private and will not be leaked out during the disease diagnosis phase. In addition, performance evaluation via extensive simulations also demonstrates that our system can efficiently calculate patient's disease risk with high accuracy in a privacy-preserving way. © 2015 IEEE.","Clinical decision support system (CDSS); naïve Bayesian classifier; patient centric; privacy preserving","Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Humans; Classification (of information); Data mining; Diagnosis; Security of data; Aggregation schemes; Bayesian classification; Bayesian classifier; Clinical decision support systems; Extensive simulations; patient centric; Privacy preserving; Security and privacy; algorithm; Bayes theorem; clinical decision support system; computer security; confidentiality; human; Decision support systems"

To identify the evaluation criteria based on citizen satisfaction from e-government services, the proposed government-to-citizen (G2C) evaluation model is considered in the context of Afghanistan. Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual G2C evaluation model and e-government evaluation model are proposed. The criteria used for the G2C evaluation model is based on the demand and supply side, which have an immense effect on citizen satisfaction. The mixed research method (quantitative and qualitative) is used, and quantitative data analysis results are supported through qualitative data analysis. Findings – The findings reveal that citizen satisfaction from e-government services in Afghanistan are affected by services availability on multiple channels, citizen-centric features, paralingual support, process performance, skills divide, awareness, information security and transaction security. Research limitations/implications – Yet to be addressed, three criteria deemed as significant factors are recommended to be included in the model, namely, government readiness, system quality (usability, service quality and information quality) for supply side and social divide for demand side. These three criteria can help in proposing a successful G2C evaluation model. Additionally, the quantitative data used in this study were collected through paper-based questionnaires. Data collection through Internet can help to get responses from various parts of the country for future evaluation of G2C services. Practical implications – The key findings of this study are vitally important for e-government strategies and policy makers to design and disseminate appropriate e-government services to Afghan citizens. The proposed evaluation model can also be used as a guideline for e-government development in Afghanistan. Originality/value – A conceptual model for e-government services evaluation approach is proposed based on literature review. The proposed G2C evaluation model identifies and validates key factors and criteria in the context of Afghanistan. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Afghanistan; Citizen satisfaction; E-government services; Evaluation approaches; Evaluation criteria; G2C",""

Ensuring the security of the activity logs is therefore crucial to ensure reliable forensics investigations. However, because of the black-box nature of clouds and the volatility and co-mingling of cloud data, providing the cloud logs to investigators while preserving users' privacy and the integrity of logs is challenging. The current secure logging schemes, which consider the logger as trusted cannot be applied in clouds since there is a chance that cloud providers (logger) collude with malicious users or investigators to alter the logs. In this paper, we analyze the threats on cloud users' activity logs considering the collusion between cloud users, providers, and investigators. Based on the threat model, we propose Secure-Logging-as-a-Service ( SecLaaS), which preserves various logs generated for the activity of virtual machines running in clouds and ensures the confidentiality and integrity of such logs. Investigators or the court authority can only access these logs by the RESTful APIs provided by SecLaaS, which ensures confidentiality of logs. The integrity of the logs is ensured by hash-chain scheme and proofs of past logs published periodically by the cloud providers. In prior research, we used two accumulator schemes Bloom filter and RSA accumulator to build the proofs of past logs. In this paper, we propose a new accumulator scheme-Bloom-Tree, which performs better than the other two accumulators in terms of time and space requirement. © 2015 IEEE.","Computer Crime; Data Security; Forensics; Information Security","Computer crime; Security of data; Analysis of various; Cloud providers; Forensics; Forensics investigations; Secure loggings; Space requirements; Threat modeling; Two accumulators; Computer forensics"

In NAC architecture, admission decisions and resource reservations are taken at edge devices, rather than resources or individual routers within the network. The NAC architecture enables resilient resource reservation, maintaining reservations even after failures and intra-domain rerouting. Admission Control Networks destiny is based on IP networks through its Security and Quality of Service (QoS) demands for real time multimedia application via advance resource reservation techniques. To achieve Security & QoS demands, in real time performance networks, admission control algorithm decides whether the new traffic flow can be admitted to the network or not. Secure allocation of Peer for multimedia traffic flows with required performance is a great challenge in resource reservation schemes. In this paper, we have proposed our model for VoIP networks in order to achieve security services along with QoS, where admission control decisions are taken place at edge routers. We have analyzed and argued that the measurement based admission control should be done at edge routers which employs on-demand probing parallel from both edge routers to secure the source and destination nodes respectively. In order to achieve Security and QoS for a new call, we choose various probe packet sizes for voice and video calls respectively. Similarly a technique is adopted to attain a security allocation approach for selecting an admission control threshold by proposing our admission control algorithm. All results are tested on NS2 based simulation to evalualate the network performance of edge router based upon network admission control in VoIP traffic. © 2016 IEEE.","Admission threshold; ecurity; Edge router; Flow priority; IntServ/RSVP; NAC; Packet loss rate; Probe flows; QoS; Resource reservation","Algorithms; Internet telephony; Multimedia systems; Network architecture; Pollution control; Probes; Quality control; Quality of service; Routers; Satellite links; Security of data; Telecommunication networks; Voice/data communication systems; Admission threshold; ecurity; Edge routers; Flow priority; Int-serv; Packet loss rates; Resource reservations; Network security"

Information security measures should ideally span from authentication to authorisation and from logical/physical access control to auditing of electronic transactions and log books. The lack of such measures compromises confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Today, most e-Government projects in developing countries in Southern Africa Developing Community (SADC) face challenges in two main areas, namely, information security and application software integration. This paper aims to discuss and analyse the information security requirements for e-Government projects and proposes an information security governance model for service-based architectures (SBAs). Design/methodology/approach – The current state of information security in emerging economies in SADC countries was researched. The main problems identified were the lack of software integration and information security governance, policy and administration. The design consists of three basic layers: information security governance defined at the strategic level of the government; information security policy/management defined at the management/operational level; and information security measures, implemented at the technical level. This section also proposes a policy for implementing public key infrastructures to protect information, transactions and e-services. A Token-Ring-based mechanism for implementing Single-Sign-On has also been developed as part of this study. Findings – The main problems identified were the lack of software integration and information security governance, policy and administration. These challenges are causing e-government projects to stagnate. Practical implications – The proposed approach for implementing information security in e-Government systems will ensure a holistic approach to ensuring confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation, allowing e-Government maturity to progress from “interaction” to “online transaction” stage in emerging economies. Originality/value – Research has not focused on developing a solution for emerging economies which are facing difficulties in integration software applications to deploy end-to-end e-services and to produce an underlying identity management architecture and information security governance to secure the e-services developed and deployed using an SBA. The work produced in this paper is specific to SBAs in e-government environments where legacy systems already exist.

In this paper, we show that the TDOA (Time Difference of Arrivals) of the mechanical waves is the main culprit for leaking information. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we glued three accelerometers in a PIN-pad, collected the vibrations generated by the keystrokes and computed the relative delays of vibration arrival times in pairs of accelerometers. We show that it is possible to estimate the positions of the keys through simple difference of the delays. A simple classification scheme using the delays yielded 96.4% of recognition success rate.

To ensure acceptance and usability, clinicians should participate early in the design. This study surveyed clinical professionals to identify and rank important functions for a tele-ICU system. Methods: This cross-sectional, prospective, structured, two-round survey included European intensive-care professionals that were not familiar with tele-ICU systems. In the first round, statements of system function specifications were evaluated for validity; in the second round, unclear items were rephrased and new items were added. Item-level content validity indexes (I-CVI) were calculated, and values above a 0.75 threshold were considered relevant. Weighted ranking points (WRP) was calculated from the ranking data. Results: A total of 26 responses were received from professionals for four European countries; the majority were intensive-care specialists (77%). A total set of 50 items were selected for the survey. Thirty-six functional specifications were identified with I-CVIs above 0.75, including online access to all patient data (13 items), related risks and alarms (8 items), audio-visual contact for consultations and for monitoring patient beds (5 items), information security (5 items), and resource allocation (5 items). The highest ranking system functions were real time monitoring, alarms, audio-visual connections, and data security. Conclusions: Professionals not familiar with tele-ICUs regarded full patient data access, alarms, data security, and audio-visual connections the most important functions in pre-implementation phase. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Content validity assessment; Tele-ICU; Telemedicine","Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Critical Care; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Patient Safety; Prospective Studies; Quality of Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Alarm systems; Hospital data processing; Information use; Patient monitoring; Security of data; Specifications; Surveys; Telemedicine; Transfer functions; European Countries; Functional specification; On-line access; Real time monitoring; System functions; System requirements; Validity assessment; Weighted rankings; access to information; Article; audiovisual aid; computer security; consultation; content validity; cross-sectional study; female; Finland; Germany; health care survey; hospital bed; human; intensive care; intensivist; male; Netherlands; nurse; patient information; patient risk; priority journal; prospective study; resource allocation; Spain; telemedicine; adult; clinical competence; health care quality; health personnel attitude; intensive care; intensive care unit; organization and management; patient safety; questionnaire; standards; Intensive care units"

The purpose of the study is to find out the major factors impacting medical data security in the Indian organizations. Current state of Research Area: Information security awareness is considered very vital because of the fact that security techniques as well as procedures are vulnerable to misuse and non-usage by the end users (see Ceraolo, 1996; and Straub, 1990). Medical data too is a crucial element of the overall information system of an organization. Any breach in the security of medical data may have detrimental effects on the organizations. Straub and Welke (1998) have argued that security breaches are far more regular and destructive than it is usually though to be. This is mainly because of the fact that the managers are generally not concerned with issues related to information security and unaware of the nature of risk. Thus there exists an immediate need to secure medical data and ensure its reliability and availability at the right time and to the right person. Methodology: For the quantitative study a survey has been conducted with the help of a close ended questionnaire. The responses were collected from employees of companies operating in the Healthcare, Telecom industry, and IT industry in India. The questionnaire was circulated in the physical mode. Convenience sampling was deployed in order to select the respondents. The validity of the constructs was assessed by means of factor analysis. Descriptive as well as inferential statistics like t-test, ANOVA have been used for obtaining the desired results. Conclusion: The study also highlighted that there are multiple constructs that should be considered while measuring the overall information security within an organization. These constructs or factors should be evaluated both individually as well as collectively in order to make the information secure and reliable. Limitations: One of the biggest limitations of the current study is that it is confined to only three sectors namely Healthcare, Telecom & IT. Further we have studied only one country i.e. India. Scope for further Research: medical data management practices in advanced as well as in emerging economies differ a lot. Such differences can be studied to provide a comprehensive framework of medical data management. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

There is a universal need present for all dynamic web applications and this universal need is the need to store, retrieve or manipulate information from a database. Most of systems which manage the databases and its requirements such as MySQL Server and PostgreSQL use SQL as their language. Flexibility of SQL makes it a powerful language. It allows its users to ask what he/she wants without leaking any information about how the data will be fetched. However the vast use of SQL based databases has made it the center of attention of hackers. They take advantage of the poorly coded Web applications to attack the databases. They introduce an apparent SQL query, through an unauthorized user input, into the legitimate query statement.

This is the objective of information security, and an information security program provides this kind of protection for a company's information assets and for the company as a whole.

In this paper, we present a taxonomy of security risk assessment drawn from 125 papers published from 1995 to May 2014. Organizations with different size may face problems in selecting suitable risk assessment methods that satisfy their needs. Although many risk-based approaches have been proposed, most of them are based on the old taxonomy, avoiding the need for considering and applying the important criteria in assessing risk raised by rapidly changing technologies and the attackers knowledge level. In this paper, we discuss the key features of risk assessment that should be included in an information security management system. We believe that our new risk assessment taxonomy helps organizations to not only understand the risk assessment better by comparing different new concepts but also select a suitable way to conduct the risk assessment properly. Moreover, this taxonomy will open up interesting avenues for future research in the growing field of security risk assessment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Information security; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Threat; Vulnerability","Information management; Knowledge management; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Taxonomies; Information assets; Information security management systems; Information security risk assessment; Risk assessment methods; Risk based approaches; Security risk assessments; Threat; Vulnerability; Risk assessment"

In this paper, confusion and diffusion phenomenon is presented for digital images. The proposed scheme provides a secure image encryption/decryption scheme using two chaotic maps and substitution boxes. To confuse the relationship between plaintext and ciphertext images, both chaotic maps play a vital role in the confusion and diffusion process. In confusion process, the plaintext image is permuted row-wise and column-wise via two random sequences generated by Henon map. The pixel values diffusion is carried out by unimodel Skew tent map through XOR operation. Furthermore, in last step of the proposed scheme, image is divided into four blocks. To get a highly diffused ciphertext, four different Substitution Boxes (S-Boxes) are applied on each block. Extensive security analysis show that the proposed scheme provides an efficient security for digital images. © 2015 IEEE.","Chaos and Image Encryption; Chaotic Maps; Information Security; Substitution","Chaotic systems; Diffusion; Image processing; Lyapunov methods; Security of data; Substitution reactions; Chaotic map; Diffusion phenomena; Image encryption scheme; Image encryptions; Multiple substitutions; Networking technology; Real-time application; Substitution boxes; Cryptography"

However, information security is still an important concern for both users and organizations. Technology cannot solely guarantee a secure environment for information; the human aspects of information security should be taken into consideration, besides the technological aspects. The lack of information security awareness, ignorance, negligence, apathy, mischief, and resistance are the root of users' mistakes. In this research, a novel model shows how complying with organizational information security policies shapes and mitigates the risk of employees' behaviour. The significant aspect of this research is derived from the conceptualization of different aspects of involvement, such as information security knowledge sharing, collaboration, intervention and experience, as well as attachment, commitment, and personal norms that are important elements in the Social Bond Theory. The results of the data analysis revealed that information security knowledge sharing, collaboration, intervention and experience all have a significant effect on employees' attitude towards compliance with organizational information security policies. However, attachment does not have a significant effect on employees' attitude towards information security policy compliance. In addition, the findings have shown that commitment and personal norms affect employees' attitude. Attitude towards compliance with information security organizational policies also has a significant effect on the behavioural intention regarding information security compliance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The quantity of malware of a size of several hundred millions require more and more refined and complex solutions and tools of protection.

The situation is made even more difficult by the fact that the continually appearing threats are active for a very short time only-for 2-3 hours or a few days. The multilevel protection systems provide protection of the computers in diverse user situations. The continuous development and complexity of the operation systems, the applications running on them, the forms and possibilities of attacks taking advantage of them and the protection solutions result in the fact that the users of computers are not aware of what sources of danger are threatening their machines and what the protection systems are capable of and to what extent they can protect the IT systems from the attacks. The independent testers specialized in the investigation of protection systems assess the protection solutions only but they can hardly answer the question to what extent the set of the protection systems used by the user can protect the infrastructure of the user against cyber-attacks. In this paper the possibilities how antimalware testing industry can provide more valuable and usable information for the protection of IT infrastructures are discussed.

In this paper, we proposed low power architectural model of MixColumn Transformation which is part of the Advanced Encryption Standard. Generally, MixColumn Transformation requires matrix multiplication which takes more number of gates, in both encryption and decryption operation. The forward MixColumn Transformation is used in Encryption operation where as inverse Mix Column Transformation is used in decryption process. In this paper, analysis of optimized power and area model Mix Column Transformation based on Galois Field model is done. The proposed Mix Column Transformation architecture has been analyzed with the help of the Galois finite field, which is tower field Advanced Encryption Standard model.

EHRs allow for increased patient safety, grant patients easier access to their medical records, and offer a wealth of data to researchers. However, various bioethical, financial, logistical, and information security considerations must be addressed while transitioning to an EHR system. The need to encrypt private patient information for data sharing is one of the foremost challenges faced by health information technology. Method: We describe the usage of the message digest-5 (MD5) and secure hashing algorithm (SHA) as methods for encrypting electronic medical data. In particular, we present an application of the MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms in encrypting a composite message from private patient information. Results: The results show that the composite message can be used to create a unique one-way encrypted ID per patient record that can be used for data sharing.

IEC 61850-5 and IEC 62351-6 standards respectively describe communication models and the security mechanisms to be deployed in current substations, but they present some inconsistencies. On the one hand, this standard mandates that RSA cryptosystem must be used to provide source authenticity of GOOSE and SV messages. However, despite expensive processors with crypto accelerators were utilized, execution times would exceed the maximum transfer times stated in the standard for most time critical applications. On the other hand, the recommended synchronization solution is the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), as defined in IEEE 1588-2008, which introduced an optional security extension based on old keyed hash algorithms that has also been demonstrated to be suboptimal due to latency times and required resources.

Multiple rainbow blocks are used to reduce the merge probability of chains and improve the success rate of password cracking. A blocked memory structure is adopted to reduce the cryptanalysis time. We also analyze the existing time-memory trade-off methods and carry out comparison experiments to evaluate the performance. The experimental results show that the cryptanalysis time of the BRT3 method is no more than 2 minutes when cracking 200 MS-Windows LM password hashes on a general desktop machine with 2GB memory.

Ever-greater numbers of devices are connected to the cloud, and the «Internet of Things» is creating further opportunities for data gathering, feedback, and positive effects ranging from better consumer experiences to environmental resource conservation. However, cloud technology and information storage have increasingly come under fire on various fronts for failing to protect consumer rights. Hacking incidents have cost extensive time and money, and spying and monitoring of citizen data by governments inside and outside of the cloud have been criticized by privacy rights advocates. Countries from the EU to the US and China have disputed the motives and actions of governmental and corporate actors from other markets under the guises of cybersecurity and cybersovereignty, focusing complaints on violations of citizen privacy. This article serves three central purposes: (1) Identifying proposals for management of cloud technology from three main sources: legislation in key jurisdictions, corporate policies, and civil society. (2) Comparing these proposals and finding common ground that may allow regulation of cloud technology internationally to face limited legislative and extralegal resistance, and (3) Offering a unique combination of solutions that draws from all corners to best facilitate the growth of cloud technology so as to maximize the positive outcomes listed above and minimize violations of personal privacy rights. We find that depoliticization of cloud technology is desirable whenever possible, and that objective and neutral standards may limit political friction. We argue that the technological infrastructure for cloud computing has outpaced societies' and governments' abilities to respond and therefore seek to speed up the process by which the latter two groups are able to effectively comprehend and regulate the technology that already exists. By addressing genuine concerns of privacy violations in the cloud via legal policy, cloud technology will be able to develop more successfully. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud computing; comparative law; cybersecurity; law and society; privacy protection","Cloud computing; Conservation; Digital storage; Natural resources; Personal computing; Cloud technologies; comparative law; Cyber security; Economic efficiency; Environmental resources; law and society; Privacy protection; Technological infrastructure; Crime"

Due to the limitations of production costs and portability, the computation, storage and power are still very constrained with the hardware of IOT, thus the security of IOT is mainly based on symmetric-key algorithms, such as block ciphers, hash functions and stream ciphers. Since hash functions play a pivotal role in digital signatures, data integrity, message authentication codes, etc., and the current hash functions widely used are still costly for IOT applications, it becomes a widely concerned topic on the construction and analysis of secure and fast lightweight hash functions that are suitable for resource-constrained environment. On the construction methods of various hash functions, three main categories (dedicated hash functions, block-cipher-based hash functions and provably secure hash functions) come from different design principles of iterated compression functions. Based on the different categories of the construction methods, we analyze the state of the art of lightweight hash functions that have been proposed in recent years. Moreover, the published cryptanalysis results on lightweight hash proposals are overviewed.

The main problem is that the question of what students should or should not do is not a settled issue, because personal stances on questions of morality and ethics fundamentally inuence the ethical recommendations that teachers present to their students. In light of the growing level of malice in the computing domain, experts have highlighted the importance of information se-curity ethics by debating the need for a standard code of ethics for information security. Arguably, differences in eth-ical stance, with the effect of divergent ethical agreements, will not efficiently serve the purpose of effective universal application of ethics in the field of information security edu-cation. Examining current ethical policies in information se-curity courses can provide insight about the prevailing ethics within the information security community. Moreover, un-derstanding what the prevailing philosophies on ethics are within the community, in terms of how they actually diverge or converge, will present a good projection of how a standard policy on ethics may be feasibly applicable in a future regula-Tory environment. This way, we may be able to forecast the nature of ethical norms that future professionals will accept or allow to be imposed on them. Therefore, in our survey, we analyze ethical agreements on information security courses to identify the nature of existing agreements. We determine the commonalities of these agreements and derive an ethical policy prototype that includes the common elements of 329 ethical policies. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

As a standing committee of the ACM Education Board, the CCECC has produced curricular guidelines for community college computing programs in the five areas outlined by ACM and IEEE-CS in CC2005 (The Overview Report) [2]. Most recently the CCECC published guidelines for IT programs in ACM Competency Model of Core Learning Outcomes and Assessment for Associate-Degree Curriculum in Information Technology [4] in October 2014. Guidelines for Computer Science programs at the associatedegree (2-year) level have generally followed the publication of Computer Science guidelines at the bachelor's degree (4-year undergraduate) level. The most recent set of associate-degree Computer Science guidelines were published in 2009 by the CCECC [3] following the 2008 Computer Science Curriculum 2008: An Interim Revision of CS 2001 [1]. In December of 2013, the ACM and IEEE-Computer Society published Computer Science Curricula 2013: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science (CS2013) [5], representing a comprehensive revision over previous guidelines. A growing diversity of topics and rapid evolution of technology necessarily leads to an evolving body of knowledge (BoK). Beyond technology advances however, the CS2013 BoK was redefined as ""a result of rethinking the essentials necessary for a Computer Science curriculum"" [5]. One of these essentials is the increased importance of cybersecurity, reflected in CS2013 in the integration of security learning outcomes throughout the BoK as well as the new knowledge area Information Assurance and Security (IAS). The importance of Cybersecurity is also demonstrated in the ACM Education Board's formation of a curricular task force to develop undergraduate guidance in Cybersecurity [6]. Following changes in the discipline and the publication of CS2013, as well as increased focus on and importance of cybersecurity in computer science, new curricular guidelines for associate-degree Computer Science programs are needed. The ACM CCECC has initiated the creation of such guidelines. The guidelines should be compatible with CS2013, fostering interinstitutional cooperation and student articulation. They should emphasize the critical importance of cybersecurity throughout the BoK. They should reflect the opportunities, constraints, and characteristics of the community college environment, facilitating use and adoption at community colleges and similar postsecondary institutions worldwide. Prior to the special session at SIGCSE, the CCECC will have conducted a survey of community college educators on knowledge units from CS2013 that may be applicable at the lower division undergraduate level. An initial draft of the associatedegree BoK will be constructed. This prior work will serve as inputs to the work carried out at the special session. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The information security domain is characterized by multipleintertwined security controls, not all of which can be regulated by standards, but compliance with existing security standards is often used by firms to deflect liability if a security breach occurs. We analyze a stylized setting where a firm has two security controls that are linked in either a serial or a parallel configuration. One control is directlyregulated by a security standard, whereas the other one is not. We show that a higher security standard does not necessarily lead to a higher firm security. Furthermore, the conditions under which a higher standard hurts the firm security are sharply different in the two-serial and parallel-configurations. If standard compliance leads to reduced liability for a firm following a breach, such liability reduction in turn weakens the tie between the standard and firm security. Under a setting in which the firm meets the optimal standard set by a policy maker, both firm security and social welfare are higher when the damage to the firm following a breach takes a higher share of the total damage to social welfare, and also when the firm takes a larger share of liability. © 2016 INFORMS.","Information security; Security regulation; Unverifiability","Compliance control; Security of data; Standards; Organizational information; Parallel configuration; Security breaches; Security controls; Security regulations; Security standards; Social welfare; Unverifiability; Regulatory compliance"

The original data is encrypted by the cryptographic algorithms with LWE. Then additional data could be embedded into the cipher text. With embedded cipher text, the additional data can be extracted by using data-hiding key, and the original data can be recovered by using encryption key, and the processes of extraction and decryption are separable. By deducing the error probability of the scheme, the standard deviation of noise sequence which directly related to the scheme's correctness is mainly discussed, and reasonable range of the standard deviation is obtained by experiments. The probability distribution function of the embedded cipher text is deduced, that proves the embedded cipher text is not detective. The proposed scheme based on encrypted domain can apply to different kinds of media vehicle such as text, image or audio.

Traditionally, confidentiality of data has been preserved using security procedures such as information security policies along with conventional security mechanisms such as firewalls, virtual private networks and intrusion detection systems. Unfortunately, these mechanisms lack pro-activeness and dedication towards protecting confidential data, and in most cases, they require predefined rules by which protection actions are taken. This can result in serious consequences, as confidential data can appear in different forms in different leaking channels. Therefore, there has been an urge to mitigate these drawbacks using more efficient mechanisms. Recently, data leakage prevention systems (DLPSs) have been introduced as dedicated mechanisms to detect and prevent the leakage of confidential data in use, in transit and at rest. DLPSs use different techniques to analyse the content and the context of confidential data to detect or prevent the leakage. Although DLPSs are increasingly being designed and developed as standalone products by IT security vendors and researchers, the term still ambiguous. In this study, we have carried out a comprehensive survey on the current DLPS mechanisms. We explicitly define DLPS and categorise active research directions in this field. In addition, we suggest future directions towards developing more consistent DLPSs that can overcome some of the weaknesses of the current ones. This survey is an updated reference on DLPSs, that can benefit both academics and professionals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For some years now, cloud computing has been in common use for such applications as Google apps (email, documents, etc), MSN Messenger (instant messaging), Skype (voice communications), and Flickr (image sharing). The idea of offering cloud computing facilities as a public utility began as early as the 1960s with John McCarthy.1-4Organisations and universities offered distributed computing starting in the late 1970s through dial-up access.5Grid computing was introduced in the early 1990s with the idea of providing access to shared computing power similar to the way electricity is shared through the electric power grid. In addition, open source platforms were first introduced by Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, and Nimbus for deploying private and hybrid clouds.6-8Although cloud computing has been available for some time, there is still some organisational resistance to its adoption, not least because of security concerns. Bilal Charif, of Luleå University of Technology, Sweden and Ali Ismail Awad of Luleå University and Al Azhar University, Egypt show that a number of organisations have no internal security responsibilities, nor do they have proper information security policies such as business and disaster recovery plans, all of which makes cloud adoption difficult.

Since people are generally susceptible to manipulation, humans often prove to be the weak link in the security chain. A social engineering attack targets this weakness by using various manipulation techniques to elicit individuals to perform sensitive requests. The field of social engineering is still in its infancy as far as formal definitions, attack frameworks, examples of attacks and detection models are concerned. This paper therefore proposes a revised version of the Social Engineering Attack Detection Model. The previous model was designed with a call centre environment in mind and is only able to cater for social engineering attacks that use bidirectional communication. Previous research discovered that social engineering attacks can be classified into three different categories, namely attacks that utilise bidirectional communication, unidirectional communication or indirect communication. The proposed (and revised) Social Engineering Attack Detection Model addresses this problem by extending the model to cater for social engineering attacks that use bidirectional communication, unidirectional communication or indirect communication. The revised Social Engineering Attack Detection Model is further verified using published generalised social engineering attack examples from each of the three categories mentioned. © 2015 IEEE.","Bidirectional Communication; Indirect Communication; Social Engineering; Social Engineering Attack Detection Model; Social Engineering Attack Examples; Unidirectional Communication","Attack detection; Bi-directional communication; Formal definition; Indirect communication; Manipulation techniques; Sensitive informations; Social engineering; Three categories; Security of data"

We proposed a method in which nouns are replaced with other nouns in consideration of semantic relations. For example, some nouns in the sentence «I go to Tokyo University of Technology with Alice» are replaced such as «I go to university with her». The method prevents the author from leaking privacy of his/her friends to the third party. Levels of obscurity are decided by the relationship between the author and readers. When the relationship is weaker than that in the example above, the message changes such as «I go to school with a friend». In the method, proper nouns and some specific nouns are automatically replaced with other appropriate nouns by hi-speed filtering with Bloom filter. We also proposed an additional method in which messages are authenticated. In the method messages are signed with sanitizable signature since some nouns have possibility to be replaced. The combination of the two proposals provides anonymity and integrity and authentication at the same time. However, I found the latter method has vulnerability. If attackers have knowledge of privacy of victims, original nouns can be specified with one hundred percent correctness. Therefore, in this paper, I propose an improve method for anonymity.

In this regard, information security is turning to be great challenge when sending information from one place to another with the aid of technology. Steganography is one of the techniques for the safe transmission which involves hiding information generally with other information that only the receiver will know. In this research, steganography technique using Daubechies Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is implemented. First the cover image is transformed using Daubechies DWT and secret information is embedded in coefficients of Daubechies DWT which gives stego image. Reverse process is applied to obtain secret information from stego image. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using PSNR and MSE. Also analysis is done to find the best sub-band to hide information among different sub-bands of Daubechies DWT. © 2015 IEEE.","Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Mean Square Error (MSE); Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR); Stego Image","Application programs; Information management; Mean square error; Security of data; Signal to noise ratio; Steganography; Wavelet transforms; Color images; Cover-image; Daubechies discrete wavelet transforms; Hiding informations; Peak signal to noise ratio; Reverse process; Secret information; Stego image; Discrete wavelet transforms"

In a virtual environment, the trainee can operate the really system. The answer of how to attack or defend is no more just one solution. You can use any method or trick to reach the goal. The outcome of training in a virtual environment can directly prove the trainee's capability. Although there is a lot of advantage to use virtual environment, it's a big problem to build it. The work of creating virtual environment includes allocation and maintenance. To allocation, because training in an environment providing daily service will decrease the performance of service. It's hard to allocate virtual environment in a real environment providing daily service. In order to simulate the real environment, it needs a lot of space and powerful computing. To maintenance, the built virtual environment needs expandable, flexibility and reusable. For example, it can change IP or count/password easily so the test would not always the same and virtual environments can be reusable. For now, it use cloud computing[8] to virtualize the virtual environment to solve the two problem. But there is still a problem of too heavy.

The findings indicate that current risk perception and preparedness are low, especially among small electricity distribution system operators. Further, small distribution system operators rely heavily on their suppliers should incidents occur. At the same time, small distribution system operators are confident that they can handle the worst-case scenarios. This paper documents current perceptions and discusses the extent to which they are likely to hold given the transition towards smart electric grids. Several recommendations are provided based on the findings and the accompanying discussion. In particular, small distribution system operators should strengthen the collaboration with their information technology (IT) suppliers and other small distribution system operators. Furthermore, distribution system operators in general should establish written documentation of procedures, perform preparedness exercises and improve detection capabilities in control systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Electric power distribution; Incident management; Incident response; Industrial control systems; Information security; Norway","Control systems; Electric industry; Electric power distribution; Electric power system security; Electric utilities; Information management; Risk perception; Security of data; Detection capability; Distribution systems; Electric power industries; Incident Management; Incident response; Industrial control systems; Information security incidents; Norway; Electric power system control"

Random source is considered to be a pillar of TRNG. There are many types of TRNG and oscillator-based random source is widely used on chip. The design of it exploits the random cycle-to-cycle time drift(jitter) in clock of low frequency to produce random bit sequence. Entropy is a basic metric of randomness. In order to increase the randomness of sequence we have to increase the jitter in clock. In this work we propose a method to find the relationship between jitter and the entropy of a bit sequence. First we calculate the possibility of a single bit under the assumption of the normal distribution. Then we give the algorithm of L-bit entropy in the worst case. Finally, we generate a series of bit sequence with different jitters and calculate the entropy with the test of AIS31. Moreover, the paper will also analyze the threshold of the ratio of jitter and period to get a bit sequence with high randomness. From our theory and experimental results, if the ratio is greater than 9.16, the raw sequence has adequate randomness. This threshold is useful to the designers of TRNG. © 2015 IEEE.","entropy; information security; jitter; oscillator-based; TRNG","Clocks; Computation theory; Entropy; Normal distribution; Number theory; Random number generation; Random processes; Security of data; Bit entropies; Bit sequences; Low-frequency; Random cycle; Random sources; Security chips; TRNG; True randoms; Jitter"

Today’s highly complex business and technological environments and the need to effectively communicate and justify IT security requirements and controls demand methodical support. The modeling method presented in this paper addresses this demand. The method is based on the assumption that enriched enterprise models integrating technological, business, organizational and strategic aspects provide an effective foundation for developing and managing IT security systems and facilitating communication and understanding between stakeholders. The proposed modeling method for designing and managing IT security in organizations accounts for different perspectives and is based on multi-perspective enterprise modeling. The core components of the method, based on analysis of requirements at different levels of abstraction, are: modeling language concepts specifically designed to address security issues, process models that guide the use of the resulting language, and a modeling environment. The method facilitates elaborate representations of the various aspects of IT security at different levels of abstraction and covers the entire lifecycle of IT security systems. It not only supports multi-perspective requirement analysis and design but also enables monitoring and analysis of IT security at runtime. The presented artifact is evaluated with recourse to a research method that enables the configuration of multi-criteria justification procedures. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Domain-specific modeling language; Enterprise modeling; Information security modeling; IT security; Multi-perspective security management",""

We review the literature on studies of parenting styles and Internet attitudes, and their relations between Internet behaviors. We employed Latent Class Analysis to cluster the child-reported parenting styles. In this regard, we found that there exist three types of parenting styles in Taiwan. We in turn implemented the 2nd-order confirmatory factor analysis to validate the 6-T internet attitude model. The so-called 6-T internet attitude model is to explain the Internet attitude by the multi-dimensions such as Tool, Telephone, Toy, Territory, Treasure and Trade. It provides the basis on which we conducted the structural regression modeling. Three kinds of Internet behavior ""online social compensation seeking"", ""online game addiction"" and ""information security behavior"" are analyzed in our research. We used the structural regression modeling to incorporate the 2nd-order confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis so that we can tell the moderating effects of parenting styles on the relation between Internet attitudes and Internet behavior by multi-group analysis.

It is possible that an adversary can damage a physical component with cyber-attacks (eg. The Stuxnet). Although many research has been done on risk assessment method, limited work has been published to quantify cybersecurity risk of CPS. This paper suggests a method to quantify the cybersecurity risk of CPS caused by cyber-attacks in terms of numeric value. To help quantitatively measure the risk, we present two indices, the successful-attack-probability index and the attack-impact index, based on vulnerability dependency graph. Furthermore, the successful-attack-probability index is calculated considering the interdependent relationship between vulnerabilities and the calculation of attack-impact index takes the impact on the physical domain resulting from cyber-attacks into account. Numerical example shows that the potential risk of system and the optimal attack target can be obtained. The proposed method can be extended to security investment analysis as well. © 2015 IEEE.","cyber-physical system; cybersecurity; risk assessment; vulnerability inter-dependency graph","Computer crime; Crime; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Engineering research; Investments; Network security; Cyber security; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Dependency graphs; Inter-dependencies; Physical components; Probability index; Risk assessment methods; Security investments; Risk assessment"

Widely available connectivity provided by modern communication technology not only resulted in an increasing threat for attacks on the infrastructure but also offered possibilities like teleworking leading to new challenges in respect to system security. A variety of space projects is being operated from our multi-mission control center (GSOC), each having its own requirements regarding information security. As cost-reduction is also a key factor for space operations these days, there is a need for being able to provide information security to all of these projects in an organized and standardized way so that synergies can be used wherever possible - both in the implementation and in the operational phases of the mission. Nevertheless both the methods and processes used as well as the implemented controls must not be too rigid in order to be able to respond to mission-specific requirements resulting e.g. from different classification levels or special needs of a customer. In order to realize the aspects mentioned above, we chose the ISO/IEC 27001 standard as the baseline, guaranteeing - in contrast to national standards - international publicity and acceptance. This standard allows management of information security on a risk oriented basis. Furthermore this approach offers the opportunity to obtain a certification. In this paper we will describe how the information security management system at GSOC (ISMS) was designed and how general information security guidelines covering important aspects like secure operations, user management, secure network and much more have been developed based on ISO 27001, taking into account important processes for space operations. Using the example of the EDRS mission, we show how these general guidelines can be used to set up security concepts for upcoming space missions while taking benefit from already implemented systems. In addition to that, we explain how project-specific processes collude with the general guidelines and how special requirements can be incorporated. We will show the procedures which were evolved for managing the complete ISMS and for identifying gaps quickly, giving the opportunity to space projects to take corrective measures in order to be compliant with the security policies. Due to its flexibility, the ISMS also showed to be able to bear with the changes caused by the update of the ISO 27001 in 2013. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Within a broader context, known as risk management, risk assessment is considered part of the due care an organization applies to the operation of a computerized information system. Using an organized and systematic approach to risk assessment is essential. There are many models proposed and in use to structure the risk assessment effort. This chapter identifies some of the more widely known models and explores a widely used approach. An approach that has been widely adopted in the information assurance industry is known as the Threat-Vulnerability-Asset (TVA) matrix. In the middle part of this chapter, this model is explored by explaining the processes used to enumerate and characterize assets, discern and evaluate threats against those assets, and identify the active and latent vulnerabilities that are present or likely. Once the three primary dimensions of the TVA model are explained, the chapter continues with an exploration of some of the more salient details regarding asset valuation and threat and vulnerability estimation. In order to extend the TVA model, the chapter adds the dimension of controls (or countermeasures) to the model; this includes the process of identifying and explaining existing controls, exploring the need for possible additional or enhanced controls, and planning for moving the information security program forward as these possible controls are deployed. A final section about documenting the results of the risk assessment processl concludes the coverage of the TVA model. The conclusion of the chapter is a review ofliterature on the topic of risk assessment and some observations on the directions future research may take. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

While our panel did not reach consensus on which scenarios may be most likely to interrupt security compliance, their experience and insight has reinforced the notion that behavioral intention is not an absolute predictor of actual behavior. As such IS security research should not culminate in evaluating impact to behavioral intention, but should instead attempt to understand a phenomena's correlation to actual behavior whenever possible. © 2016 Association for Information Systems.

Cyber-threats information sharing among different organizations has the potential to maximize vulnerabilities discovery at a minimum cost. Cyber-threats information sharing has several advantages. First, it diminishes the chance that an attacker exploits the same vulnerability to launch multiple attacks in different organizations. Second, it reduces the likelihood an attacker can compromise an organization and collect data that will help him launch an attack on other organizations. Cyberspace has numerous interconnections and critical infrastructure owners are dependent on each other's service. This well-known problem of cyber interdependency is aggravated in a public cloud computing platform. The collaborative effort of organizations in developing a countermeasure for a cyber-breach reduces each firm's cost of investment in cyber defense. Despite its multiple advantages, there are costs and risks associated with cyber-threats information sharing. When a firm shares its vulnerabilities with others there is a risk that these vulnerabilities are leaked to the public (or to attackers) resulting in loss of reputation, market share and revenue. Therefore, in this strategic environment the firms committed to share cyber-threats information might not truthfully share information due to their own self-interests. Moreover, some firms acting selfishly may rationally limit their cybersecurity investment and rely on information shared by others to protect themselves. This can result in under investment in cybersecurity if all participants adopt the same strategy. This paper will use game theory to investigate when multiple self-interested firms can invest in vulnerability discovery and share their cyber-threat information. We will apply our algorithm to a public cloud computing platform as one of the fastest growing segments of the cyberspace. © 2015 IEEE.","cloud computing; cybersecurity; game theory; information sharing","Cloud computing; Competition; Computation theory; Computer games; Computers; Costs; Distributed computer systems; Economics; Game theory; Information analysis; Investments; Network security; Societies and institutions; Cost of investment; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Game-theoretic; Information shared; Information sharing; Public clouds; Vulnerability discovery; Information dissemination"

Many applications (i.e., information security display and simultaneous dual-subtitle exhibition) have been developed based on SPVM. In the implementation of the SPVM systems, the original images are down-sampled line-by-line due to the property of polarization screens. The sampling process causes aliasing and influence negatively on the image quality. In this paper, we add a Lowpass Filter (LPF) into the original system before the sampling to eliminate the aliasing. We compare the improved algorithm and the direct method with objective image quality assessment (IQA). For both natural and computer generated images are used in SPVM, we tested our algorithm on many different databases. Considering the view distance of the SPVM system, we used the SAST model as the metrics of image quality. As a result, the proposed algorithm improves the IQA benchmark, which corresponds to our observation. The test also works as an application and test bed of the SAST IQA model. All the equipments of the multi-view exhibition system is off-the-shelf so it's cheaper to realize. And the enhancement in quality make the system capable for screens with lower PPI. © 2015 IEEE.","aliasing; image quality assessment; SPVM; TPVM","Exhibitions; Low pass filters; Security of data; Aliasing; Computer-generated images; Display technologies; Image quality assessment; Objective image quality assessment; Quality enhancement; SPVM; TPVM; Image quality"

This paper studies the cybersecurity risks of the traction power voltage control system that regulates the voltages of railway feeder substations. We derive the stability condition of the control system when it is under a signal delay attack, i.e., the timing information of voltage measurements is maliciously corrupted so that the system wrongly uses old measurements to make control decisions. Our analysis and simulations show a fundamental trade-off between the voltage convergence speed when trains' reactive power draw varies and the tolerable malicious time delay in terms of system stability. © 2015 IEEE.","","Control systems; Economic and social effects; Electric railroads; Railroads; System stability; Time delay; Traction control; Transportation; Voltage control; Voltage measurement; Analysis and simulation; Control decisions; Convergence speed; Electrified railways; Safety incidents; Stability condition; Timing information; Traction power system; Delay control systems"

XBRL provides a structure based on XML for extraction of this data, however, there are gaps in the XBRL nomenclature that necessitates the use of scripting for pulling the non-XBRL components. The extensive written portions of the annual disclosure statements where the security related information is present (based on SEC guidance) tends to be poorly described in terms of tag set deployment.

Tor is a valuable tool for hackers, drug and gun dealers. The present paper is focused on Tor users' deanonimization using out-of-the box technologies and a basic machine learning algorithm. The aim of the work is to show that it is possible to deanonimize a small fraction of users without having a lot of resources and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The first stage of the research was the investigation of contemporary anonymous networks. The second stage was the investigation of deanonimization techniques: Traffic analysis, timing attacks, attacks with autonomous systems. For our system, we used website fingerprinting attack, because it requires the smallest number of resources needed for successful implementation of the attack. Finally, there was an experiment held with 5 persons in one room with one corrupted entry Tor relay.

As awareness turns into concerns, users will realize that they will not be able to manage all their privacy handling themselves. The abundance and persistence of personal data and personal information have elevated the risks to individual’s privacy and personal information security breaches are common. Users of Cloud Computing show growing interest in protecting information stored in the cloud as a result of a greater concern for your privacy. In order to enforce privacy in an online world according to then different privacy policies and how we can fusion them, we propose a conceptual framework in Ambient Intelligent focused in the technology of Cloud Computing that includes the different privacy policies and privacy issues must be considered in the Design by Privacy in Cloud Computing taking care of interaction between technologies, devices, users and application’s domain. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Cloud Computing; Cloud Environment; Cloud Provider; Cloud Storage; Digital Right Management","Cloud security; Data privacy; Information management; Cloud environments; Cloud providers; Cloud storages; Cloud-computing; Digital Rights Management; Media usage; Privacy issue; Privacy policies; Privacy risks; Social media; Cloud storage"

The executive order from the U. S. federal government clearly encourages the firms to share their cybersecurity breach and patch related information among other federal and private firms for strengthening their as well as nation's security infrastructure. In this paper, we present a game theoretic framework to investigate the economic benefits of cyber-threat information sharing and analyze the impacts and consequences of not participating in the game of information exchange. We model the information exchange framework as distributed non-cooperative game among the firms and investigate the implications of information sharing and security investments. The proposed incentive model ensures and self-enforces the firms to share their breach information truthfully for maximization of its gross utility. Theoretical analysis of the incentive framework has been conducted to find the conditions under which firms' net benefit for sharing security information and investment can be maximized. Numerical results verify that the proposed model promotes such sharing, which helps to relieve their total security technology investment too. © 2015 IEEE.","Cyber-threat intelligence; CYBEX; Game theory; Information exchange","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Economics; Game theory; Information analysis; Investments; Cyber threats; CYBEX; Game-theoretic model; Information exchange framework; Information exchanges; Intelligence sharing; Security infrastructure; Security investments; Information dissemination"

We design several attacks including cyber-physical system attacks and advanced cyber attacks, and then evaluate their impact via practical evaluations. Our proposed offensive techniques are based on the following current smart home status: (1) almost every smart home appliance is directly or indirectly connected to the Internet for remote monitoring and/or control. (2) there are Internet services that integrate heterogeneous devices into one single smart home environment. These integration services make it easy and simple to build any form of customised smart home configurations. However, at the same time, such services also put the smart home at risk when they are compromised and abused by attackers, which means that the attackers can achieve their goals without needing to compromise individual smart home devices. Our evaluation results show that using traditional web attack techniques such as cookie stealing can be turned into sophisticated attacks that enable the attackers to perform various malicious activities such as unlocking the smart lock installed at the target premises and disarming security alarms. Considering existing research efforts on the smart home security are mainly about security analysis of individual devices and protocols, we believe this work will shed light on the practical implications of integrating the smart home with the Internet of things, therefore helping the development of more secure smart home environments in the future. © 2015 IEEE.","Cyber-Physical Systems; Internet of Things; Malware; Security; Smart Home","Automation; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Domestic appliances; Embedded systems; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Network security; 'current; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical systems; Design and evaluations; Home environment; Malware attacks; Malwares; Security; Smart homes; Malware"

This work proposes a method of parameterization of the IPsec protocol framework, aimed at security of data interoperability in Smart Grid, according to the requirement levels for the security services: Integrity, Confidentiality and Availability, recommended by the SGIRM (Smart Grid Interoperability Reference Model [1]). The methodology can be used for VPN IPsec Site-to-Site implementations between any pair of the seven domains of the SGIRM: Generation, Transmission, Distribution, Service Providers, Markets, Control / Operations and Customers. The methodology proposed for the VPN Ipsec implementation was applied as step-by-step tasks and implemented in a test bed network. Each test was repeated twenty times aimed at data analysis and statistical evaluation of the results. The field tests allowed us to measure jitter (latency variation) and data flow throughput resulting from the parameterization of IPsec to compare the results with the limits set out in SGIRM, aiming to validate the methodology. © 2015 IEEE.","Confidentiality; Cybersecurity; Integrity; IPsec protocol; Latency; Programming CLI (Command Line Interface); Security Services; SGIRM; Smart Grid; Throughput","Electric power transmission networks; Network security; Parameterization; Security of data; Smart power grids; Throughput; Command line interface; Confidentiality; Cyber security; Integrity; IPsec protocol; Latency; Security services; SGIRM; Smart grid; Interoperability"

The recent effort led by US National Electric Sector Cybersecurity Organization Resource (NESCOR) Technical Working Group 1 to compile failure scenarios is an important initiative to document typical cybersecurity threats to smart grids. While these scenarios are an invaluable thought-aid, companies still face challenges in systematically and efficiently applying the failure scenarios to assess security risks for their specific infrastructure. In this work, we develop a model-based process for assessing the security risks from NESCOR failure scenarios. We extend our cybersecurity assessment tool, Cyber-SAGE, to support this process, and use it to analyze 25 failure scenarios. Our results show that CyberSAGE can generate precise and structured security argument graphs to quantitatively reason about the risk of each failure scenario. Further, CyberSAGE can significantly reduce the assessment effort by allowing the reuse of models across different failure scenarios, systems, and attacker profiles to perform what if? analysis. © 2015 IEEE.","cybersecurity; NESCOR; Smart grid","Electric power transmission networks; Outages; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Assessment tool; Cyber security; Failure scenarios; Model-based OPC; NESCOR; Smart grid; Technical working groups; Traditional power system; Smart power grids"

That is, it is centrally concerned with how to “make” strategy; this extends the concern about what strategy “is.” From a process viewpoint, information security strategy involves one or more strategy-setting processes. Such processes require an assessment of the goals for organizational information security. Examples include compliance with regulatory requirements, national and international standards, and professional practices. The strategy-setting process may be organized using a product criterion or a process criterion. A product criterion would organize the strategy-setting process by grouping activities according to the end products of the process. The products of strategy setting include statements of vision, core values, rationale, and strategic plans such as the security organization structure, security operations, and security budgeting strategy. A process criterion would organize the strategy-setting process by grouping activities according to major components, such as the alignment of security with organizational strategy, the planning of operational strategies, and the planning of security organizations. This chapter elaborates not just security goals, but the goalassessment process; not just the security criteria, but the criterion organizing processes; and not just the products of the strategic processes, but the strategy-setting processes themselves. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

This paper presents a data retrieval system by using public key encryption system with keyword search, in which the client could test whether or not the file stored in cloud server contains the keyword without leaking the information about the encrypted file. We apply asymmetric pairings to achieve shorter key size scheme in the standard model, and adopt the dual system encryption technique to reduce the scheme's secure problem to the hard Symmetric External Diffie-Hellman assumption.

It has been demonstrated that common hackers can use tools and techniques downloaded from the Internet to attack government and commercial information systems. Although threats may come from mischief makers and pranksters, they are more likely to result from hackers working in concert for profit, hackers working under the protection of nation states, or malicious insiders. Securing an IT Organization through Governance, Risk Management, and Audit introduces two internationally recognized bodies of knowledge: Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT 5) from a cybersecurity perspective and the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (CSF). Emphasizing the processes directly related to governance, risk management, and audit, the book provides details of a cybersecurity framework (CSF), mapping each of the CSF steps and activities to the methods defined in COBIT 5. This method leverages operational risk understanding in a business context, allowing the information and communications technology (ICT) organization to convert high-level enterprise goals into manageable, specific goals rather than unintegrated checklist models. The real value of this methodology is to reduce the knowledge fog that frequently engulfs senior business management, and results in the false conclusion that overseeing security controls for information systems is not a leadership role or responsibility but a technical management task. By carefully reading, implementing, and practicing the techniques and methodologies outlined in this book, you can successfully implement a plan that increases security and lowers risk for you and your organization. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Moreover, they are at different stages of development, with the issue of NIS part of the EU agenda for over ten years, and cyber defence only appearing more explicitly as a specific cybersecurity priority in the EUCSS. There will, thus, be a certain asymmetry in the balance of the analysis that follows, but it will nevertheless focus on the evolution of the two strands in the context of building resilience and indeed defence prior to the publication of the EUCSS and offer an early assessment of how measures outlined in the strategy might move the EU towards effective security as resilience in the near future.

Security within national boundaries doesn’t make sense. Everything is globally connected. A European approach doesn’t make sense unless aligned to the approach of international partners’ (SDA Report 2012). Thus the EU’s construction of its cybersecurity ecosystem is embedded within, bounded by, and inexorably connected to the evolving global ecosystem of cybersecurity governance, and more broadly, Internet governance. The EU has emphasised in its Internal Security Strategy (November 2010) and the European Guidelines and Principles for Internet Resilience document (March 2011) the importance of working in partnership with global partners to address the civilian and military aspects of cybersecurity challenges. The global interconnectedness of the Internet ecosystem means that threats can emanate from any source around the world, which in turn requires solutions and policies that are borderless. The vulnerability of the Internet, and the interdependence between networks, information systems and individuals, makes it impossible for any single actor to assess and respond to cyber threats and risks. Moreover, national responses alone cannot be effective given the integration between electronic, economic and political networks across the globe, and in order to achieve this there must be a step-change in the coordination of approaches not only downwards, but also upward and outward to institutions, networks and actors, technical and political, that have a role to play in constructing security resilience within the many different aspects of cybersecurity. © 2016, George Christou.","",""

In this paper, we show that the Acoustic Transfer Function (ATF) of the device carries information that discloses the pressed key. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we glued two microphones in empty spaces of two different PIN-pads, collected the acoustic emission generated by the keystrokes and estimated the transfer functions of the system through the two acquired audio signals. A simple classification scheme using the ATFs yielded 99.6% of recognition accuracy in one device and 46% in the other. The results show that there are devices that can be easily attacked using ATF and those that are more difficult to attack using this technique. We analyzed again the data where we obtained 99.6% of accuracy, this time using the traditional frequency spectrum based technique, obtaining only 52% of recognition rate.

The book is presented in chapters that follow a consistent methodology – Assess, Plan, Design, Execute, and Report. The first chapter, Assess, identifies the elements that drive the need for infosec programs, enabling you to conduct an analysis of your business and regulatory requirements. Plan discusses how to build the foundation of your program, allowing you to develop an executive mandate, reporting metrics, and an organizational matrix with defined roles and responsibilities. Design demonstrates how to construct the policies and procedures to meet your identified business objectives, explaining how to perform a gap analysis between the existing environment and the desired end-state, define project requirements, and assemble a rough budget. Execute emphasizes the creation of a successful execution model for the implementation of security projects against the backdrop of common business constraints. Report focuses on communicating back to the external and internal stakeholders with information that fits the various audiences.

These are the increasing acceptance and practice of (some form of) reflexivity in social science research, on the one hand, and, on the other, the changing context of research itself. On the latter point, we note that criminologists working across different jurisdictions are experiencing heightened pressures to render their research relevant and appealing to external audiences. These pressures are linked in part with the fact that governments in Australia, the UK and the USA (along with other countries) are increasingly keen to ensure that their investment in the higher education sector is delivering ‘value for money’. This implies that research and teaching activities that are government-funded must increasingly align with, or at least demonstrate alignment with, what these governments define as the public interest. In Australia, for example, the Australian Research Council, which is responsible for administering public research funding, has identified a list of nine strategic ‘Science and Research Priorities’ to organise funding of ‘support for science and research on the most important challenges facing Australia’ (developed partly from a 2014 white paper ‘Boosting the commercial returns of research’; see ARC 2016). With the possible exception of ‘cybersecurity’, none of these strategic priorities appear to be directly relevant to criminology or indeed, the social sciences. The specified research priorities relate primarily to what are known as ‘STEM’ subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine), thereby prioritising an increasingly narrow set of subjects and research methodologies that reflect a pragmatic and in our view myopic governmental understanding of what constitutes societal value. © The Author(s) 2017.","Crime control; Criminal Justice; Critical Criminology; High education sector; Knowledge exchange",""

It is therefore important that all relevant departments of the European institutions and agencies coordinate their efforts and bring in the perspective of Member States so that the full range of cybersecurity issues are considered from the public side, enabling the private sector to focus its efforts on developing a European cybersecurity industry through the adoption of an approach linked to the high and fast growth of technological competence and competitiveness. Only with strong governance and a dynamic approach can a PPP on cybersecurity develop a sustainable Digital Single Market ecosystem in Europe, making it a real and global cybersecurity leader. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Critical industrial systems; Cybercrime; Cybersecurity; Cyberterrorism; Digital Single Market; Industry; Public-Private Partnership; R&D; R&I; Security market",""

The present research aims to address these questions through surveying a sample of ex-cybersecurity competition participants from New York University’s Cyber-Security Awareness Week (CSAW). 195 survey respondents reported on their self-esteem, general self-efficacy, and perceived efficacy in cybersecurity-related tasks, along with important competition- and career-related variables such as reasons for participating, competition performance, appeal and effectiveness of competitions, job satisfaction, and perceived organizational fit. Correlational analyses showed that confidence in cybersecurity-related tasks was positively related to interest in cybersecurity, performance within the competition, job satisfaction within a cybersecurity job, and perceived organizational fit within cybersecurity organizations. Specific self-efficacy was better at predicting competition performance than general self-efficacy or self-esteem, but was unrelated to participants’ positive image of competitions and whether or not the cybersecurity competitions influenced their career decisions. Instead, general self-efficacy was a better predictor of positive competition experience even more-so than performance within the competition. Overall, the results show that participants with self-confidence in their cybersecurity-relevant skills are more likely to do well in the competition and be satisfied when entering a cybersecurity career, but any participant with high general self-efficacy will likely still have a positive experience when participating in competitions. © 2016 USENIX Workshop on Advances in Security Education, ASE 2016, co-located with the 25th USENIX Security Symposium.

However, in practice quite often security aspects are considered either at the later stages of development cycles (increments in agile projects) or addressed only when problems arise. One of the reasons for difficulties of early detection of security requirements is the complexity of security requirements identification. In this paper we discuss an extension of the method for security requirements elicitation from business processes (SREBP). The extension includes the application of the enterprise model frame to provide an enterprise architecture context for analyzed business process models. The enterprise model frame covers practically all concepts of the information security related definitions; the use of the frame with the SREBP method complies with the common enterprise modeling and enterprise architecture approaches; and it use helps to consider security requirements and control at the business, application, and technology levels simultaneously. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.","Business process models; Enterprise modeling; Security requirements elicitation","Cryptography; Requirements engineering; Business Process; Business process modeling; Enterprise Architecture; Enterprise models; Requirements elicitation; Security aspects; Security controls; Security requirement elicitation; Security requirements; System development process; Security of data"

Many hands-on exercises for cybersecurity courses have been developed to teach these skills. There is a spectrum of ways that these exercises can be taught. On one end of the spectrum are prescriptive exercises, in which students follow step-by- step instructions to run scripted exploits, perform penetration testing, do security audits, etc. On the other end of the spectrum are open-ended exercises and capture-the- flag activities, where little guidance is given on how to proceed. This paper reports on our experience with trying to find a balance between these extremes in the context of one of the suite of cybersecurity exercises that we have developed in the EDURange framework1. The particular exercise that we present teaches students about dynamic analysis of binaries using strace. We have found that students are most successful in these exercises when they are given the right amount of prerequisite knowledge and guidance as well as some opportunity to find creative solutions. Our scenarios are specifically designed to develop analysis skills and the security mindset in students and to complement the theoretical aspects of the discipline and develop practical skills. © 2016 USENIX Workshop on Advances in Security Education, ASE 2016, co-located with the 25th USENIX Security Symposium.

The main challenge for faculty in adopting peer instruction is the development of conceptual questions. This paper presents a methodology for developing peer instruction questions systematically for cybersecurity courses. The method consists of four stages: concept identification, concept trigger, question presentation, and question development.

Simulation is an emerging field in testing and assessing cybersecurity risk as it allows modeling cyber systems, their interdependencies, and interactions between cyber systems and people who are using, policing, and even attacking these systems. With cybersecurity scenarios, we help describe and formulate these complex interdependencies and relationships. In this paper, we first characterize cybersecurity scenarios along (1) the nature of cyber systems with considerations for design and (2) the type of actor with considerations of abilities. This characterization provides a more clear distinction compared to military oriented LVC (Live-Virtual-Constructive) simulation characterization. We then review examples from the literature based on our characterization. According to our review, we note that cyber system representation has been widely explored while actor representation is often realized at the technical-level dismissing social and cognitive aspects. Thus, we believe that paying more attention to social and cognitive aspects of actor representation, especially as developing general-purpose tools, will benefit the modeling and simulation community. © 2016 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS)","actor representation; cyber system representation; Cybersecurity; simulation for cybersecurity","Network security; Risk assessment; Actor representation; Cognitive aspects; Cybe system representation; Cyber security; Cyber systems; Cyber-attacks; Forcings; Simulation for cybersecurity; System representation; Cybersecurity"

In recent years, NASA sent a probe to Mars to study the Red Planet’s upper atmosphere, obtained high resolution images of Pluto, and it is currently preparing to find new exoplanets, rendezvous with an asteroid, and bring a sample of the asteroid back to Earth for analysis. The success of these missions is enabled by mission assurance. In turn, mission assurance is backed by information assurance. The information systems supporting NASA missions must be reliable as well as secure. NASA-like every other U.S. Federal Government agency-is required to manage the security of its information systems according to federal mandates, the most prominent being the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the legislative updates that followed it. Like the management of enterprise information technology (IT), federal information security management takes a “one-size fits all” approach for protecting IT systems. While this approach works for most organizations, it does not effectively translate into security of highly specialized systems such as those supporting NASA missions. These systems include command and control (C&C) systems, spacecraft and instrument simulators, and other elements comprising the ground segment. They must be carefully configured, monitored and maintained, sometimes for several years past the missions’ initially planned life expectancy, to ensure the ground system is protected and remains operational without any compromise of its confidentiality, integrity and availability. Enterprise policies, processes, procedures and products, if not effectively tailored to meet mission requirements, may not offer the needed security for protecting the information system, and they may even become disruptive to mission operations. Certain protective measures for the general enterprise may not be as efficient within the ground segment. This is what the authors have concluded through observations and analysis of patterns identified from the various security assessments performed on NASA missions such as MAVEN, OSIRIS-REx, New Horizons and TESS, to name a few. The security audits confirmed that the framework for managing information system security developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the federal government, and adopted by NASA, is indeed effective. However, the selection of the technical, operational and management security controls offered by the NIST model-and how they are implemented-does not always fit the nature and the environment where the ground system operates in even though there is no apparent impact on mission success. The authors observed that unfit controls, that is, controls that are not necessarily applicable or sufficiently effective in protecting the mission systems, are often selected to facilitate compliance with security requirements and organizational expectations even if the selected controls offer minimum or non-existent protection. This paper identifies some of the standard security controls that can in fact protect the ground system, and which of them offer little or no benefit at all. It offers multiple scenarios from real security audits in which the controls are not effective without, of course, disclosing any sensitive information about the missions assessed. In addition to selection and implementation of controls, the paper also discusses potential impact of recent legislation such as the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014-aimed at the enterprise-on the ground system, and offers other recommendations to Information System Owners (ISOs). © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Our model of the adversary abstractly captures typical malicious attacks envisioned on cyber-physical systems such as sensor spoofing, controller corruption, and actuator intrusion. After formulating the problem in a general setting, we present a sound and complete algorithm for the case with linear dynamics and an adversary with a budget on the total L2-norm of its actions. The algorithm relies on a result from linear control theory that enables us to decompose and compute the reachable states of the system in terms of a symbolic simulation of the adversary-free dynamics and the total uncertainty induced by the adversary. With this decomposition, the synthesis problem eliminates the universal quantifier on the adversary's choices and the symbolic controller actions can be effectively solved using an SMT solver. The constraints induced by the adversary are computed by solving second-order cone programmings. The algorithm is later extended to synthesize state-dependent controller and to generate attacks for the adversary. We present preliminary experimental results that show the effectiveness of this approach on several example problems.  © 2016 ACM.","constraint-based synthesis; controller synthesis; cyber-physical security","Budget control; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Dynamical systems; Embedded systems; Linear control systems; Network security; Second-order cone programming; Constraint-based; Constraint-based synthesis; Controller synthesis; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-Physical securities; Cyber-physical systems; Linear dynamical systems; Malicious attack; Sound and complete; Synthesis algorithms; Controllers"

Nevertheless, logs provide tremendous support during digital forensics investigations as they consist of vast amounts of information, e.g. step-by-step events that occurred in a system in question, including time stamping [AIJ12].

Less attention is given to how ISRM can be enhanced using security analytics to contribute to a competitive advantage. This paper proposes a model showing that security analytics capabilities (the ability to effectively use security data for informed security related decision making) and ISRM capabilities (the ability to effectively identify and protect organizational information assets) indirectly influence competitive advantage in ISRM through two key mediating links: analytics-enabled ISRM capabilities (the ability to effectively leverage insights gleaned from security data to make informed ISRM decisions) and ISRM dynamic capabilities (the ability to reconfigure analytics-enabled ISRM capabilities to address turbulent environments). Environmental turbulence moderates the process by which security analytics and ISRM capabilities influence competitive advantage.

As a result, in order to get rid of this problem, several types of intrusion detection methods with different levels of accuracy have been proposed which leads the choice of an effective and robust method for IDS as a very important topic in information security. In this regard, the support vector machine (SVM) has been playing an important role to provide potential solutions for the IDS problem. However, the practicability of introducing SVM is affected by the difficulties in selecting appropriate kernel and its parameters. From this viewpoint, this paper presents the work to apply different kernels for SVM in ID Son the KDD'99 Dataset and NSL-KDD dataset as well as to find out which kernel is the best for SVM. The important deficiency in the KDD'99 data set is the huge number of redundant records as observed earlier. Therefore, we have derived a data set RRE-KDD by eliminating redundant record from KDD'99train and test dataset prior to apply different kernel for SVM. This RRE-KDD consists of both KDD99Train+ and KDD99 Test+ dataset for training and testing purposes, respectively. The way to derive RRE-KDD data set is different from that of NSL-KDD data set. The experimental results indicate that Laplace kernel can achieve higher detection rate and lower false positive rate with higher precision than other kernel son both RRE-KDD and NSL-KDD datasets. It is also found that the performances of other kernels are dependent on datasets. © 2016, Academy and Industry Research Collaboration Center (AIRCC).","Intrusion detection; KDD'99; Kernel; Kernel selection; NSL-KDD; Support vector machine",""

The challenge of protecting the confidentiality and privacy of data lies in developing effective and transparent security policies and protocols that govern access to and integrity of both proprietary and public information. Our findings highlight that these challenges stem from the complexity of the information chain and the heterogeneity of stakeholders and data sources in the sustainable coffee supply chain.

The methodology provides a systematic approach for independently evaluating /physical and cyber security risks across a portfolio of dams, and informing decisions on how to mitigate those risks. The CRM-D can effectively quantify the benefits of implementing a particular risk mitigation strategy and, consequently, enable return-on-investment analyses for multiple physical and cyber security risk mitigation alternatives and facilitate their implementation across a portfolio of dams. The security posture of critical assets within each facility is characterized using generic security configurations associated with the target. Vulnerability estimates, defined as probabilities of successful attack, are elicited from subject-matter experts for a set of attack vectors against generic security configurations at a dam project. Elicitation is conducted separately for different types of adversary. Vulnerability can be estimated for an attack on a target protected by any combination of generic security configurations. Vulnerability estimates are combined with consequence estimates to calculate a risk value for each attack, conditional on it being selected by adversaries. A decision metric, referred to as exposure, is used to aggregate conditional risk estimates across scenarios. This facilitates the comparison of risks by attack type, by target component, or by any set of scenario conditions. The CRM-D methodology also incorporates an adversary decision model that allows estimating threat, expressed as the probabilities of attack scenarios given one of the scenarios in the set is chosen. The adversary decision model, which is based on analysis techniques commonly applied in market research, constitutes a unique contribution to the methods of eliciting expert opinions and uncertainty about intent and capabilities of adversaries. Threat estimates can be combined with consequence and vulnerability estimates to produce estimates of risk for individual attack scenarios, as well as the portfolio as a whole. A cybersecurity risk model to facilitate high-level risk assessments of industrial control systems used to control dam critical functions is also being implemented. The cyber security system architecture and existing defenses at the dam are characterized and used to establish a qualitative cyber vulnerability rating. Vulnerability and consequence estimates are combined to produce conditional risks and facilitate the identification of those projects where stronger cyber-security measures should be implemented to reduce cyber risks to acceptable levels.","","Dams; Investments; Risk perception; Risks; Safety engineering; Security systems; Uncertainty analysis; Department of Homeland Security; Industrial control systems; Physical and cyber security; Return-on-investment analysis; Risk mitigation strategy; Security configurations; Security risk assessments; Subject matter experts; Risk assessment"

It introduces, among others, the concept of security zones and security conduits [IE09]. The security zones can be defined in a physical sense and for logical grouping. By applying the defense-in-depth concept, both definitions are relevant. The development of a realistic three-dimensional (3D) model of CII can support the subdivision for the zoning and further security analyses. The model includes the locations of security relevant physical assets, which can be grouped into security zones and linked with related security artefacts.

The data management pillars identified include preserving historical information, new information, data integrity, and basic metadata for key variables and attributes. Several data management challenges existed that were addressed by the strategy developed. These challenges include preserving information over time, reducing data duplication, achieving consistency across areas and platforms, and ensuring that the data are available. In addition, the strategy must provide information security and improve business decision making capabilities. The primary benefits of the strategy used to address the challenges include reduced costs, improved time, and increased availability of data. An integrated solution was implemented in a recent successful case for a major oil company in which key data management pillars were identified, and a new approach was established to improve the data quality of the oil and gas upstream lifecycle information. After implementing the solution, improvements were made for new information quality control and in the availability time for the interpreters. The final users and managers were able to know the status and the key performance indicators (KPIs) of their data projects before beginning work and during the entire interpretation process. In addition, the teams were able to generate synergies to make the necessary validations to preserve geological knowledge. Finally, the technical users could quickly identify the information to be used in the different leases and areas of interest.

Often they use algorithms and key sizes which are not considered cryptographically secure in order to maintain a smooth user experience. Emerging approaches have begun using a devices Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to offload some of the computational burden from the Central Processing Unit (CPU) in an effort to parallelize and accelerate the encryption algorithms. Programming for a GPU often involves the use of CUDA or OpenCL programming, however these approaches are platform dependant. This research focuses on utilizing a GPU to perform in-browser cryptography using WebGL and JavaScript. This allows any GPU-enabled device capable of launching an OpenGL compatible browser to perform GPU accelerated cryptography.

This attack spurred governments and private industry owners of Critical Infrastructure to inspect their cybersecurity practices with the hopes of improving their protection methodologies. While this introspective approach has helped owners and operators of critical infrastructure realize the startling deficiency of security in this area, it has also spawned many attempts to remediate these problems that do not solve the underlying causes of the existing gaps in protection. In this chapter, three “post-Stuxnet” cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure sectors in three different countries are investigated-the USA, Germany, and Turkey. This analysis details the vectors of attack in each incident, the resulting impact, and measures that have been taken by both the public and private sectors in each country to bolster the security posture of their infrastructure after the incident. The result indicates common issues among all three incidents, namely faults in the design of the underlying control systems used and a dichotomy between the actions taken by corresponding governments and private industry. In order to address these faults, there needs to be scalable and risk-based processes to improve supporting processes of cybersecurity in critical infrastructure-namely information sharing, accountability, and risk assessment. This research provides insights into the effects of recent destructive cyber-attacks and the divide between governments and private industry, as well as lapses in security programs that prevents the effective defense of critical infrastructure. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.","Critical infrastructure; Cybersecurity; Information sharing; Risk assessment; Security policy",""

We contribute to this approach by concretely exploring a viable implementation solution and evaluating its effectiveness. Specifically, we explore to discuss relevant cybersecurity topics in upper and graduate level non-security courses to engage students in learning cybersecurity knowledge and skills from the perspectives of different computer science sub-areas, and help them understand the correlation and interplay between cybersecurity and other sub-areas of computer science. Our experience in six class sessions of five non-security courses is very encouraging: the majority of students found the discussed cybersecurity topics interesting, useful, and relevant; they would like to have cybersecurity topics discussed in other non-cybersecurity courses in the future; they improved their understanding of the discussed content.

First, it correlates historical alerts to identify the most typical strategies attackers have used. Then, it associates upcoming alerts in real time according to the strategies discovered in the first step. The experiments were performed using a real data set from the University of Maryland.

To manage this, SmartCities are deploying truly distributed and highly scalable information and communication (ICT) infrastructure, connecting a conglomerate of smart devices and ‘smart things’. In recent years, the term Internet-of-Things (IoT) was coined to describe constrained systems that react via sensors to physical changes in its environment and may be able to influence that environment via actuators. While ICT generally helps to ‘mine’ collected information, the IoT complements this with direct access to a sensor’s data or even taking immediate corrective action. Using the capabilities of the IoT to monitor and control the SmartCity implies numerous devices communicate data about the city its citizens. The communicated data is used to make decisions that will affect many citizens, and if not secured correctly, attackers (or other ‘errors’) could disrupt operation of the SmartCity. Moreover, collected data possibly impinges on basic privacy rights if not gathered, communicated and processed correctly. This chapter provides a primer on general information security, its main goals, and the basic IoT security challenges in the SmartCity. Built upon the basic IT security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, this chapter addresses security and privacy problems faced in the communication aspects of the SmartCity. We highlight that security is a crucial enabler for the ICT-dependent SmartCity to base the decisions on reliable data and to execute commands securely. We specifically point out that security starts at the very beginning of the data collection and communication process. On top of this, we focus on major issues related to private communication, as privacy is a key acceptance factor for an ICT-enabled SmartCity by its citizens. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Anonymous communication; Confidentiality; Digital signatures; Encryption; End-to-end security; Integrity; Internet of Things (IoT); Mix networks; Privacy; Unobservable communication",""

This article explains why that approach is as outmoded for cybersecurity today as it became for physical security centuries ago. Three forces are undermining the castle model as a practical security solution. First, organizations themselves tear down their walls and make their gateways more porous because it pays off in terms of better agility and responsiveness—they can do more, faster and better. Second, technological developments increasingly destroy walls from the outside as computation becomes cheaper for attackers, and the implementation of virtual walls and gateways becomes more complex, and so contains more vulnerabilities to be exploited by the clever and unscrupulous. Third, changes in the way humans and technology interact, exemplified (but not limited to) the Millennial generation, blur and dissolve the concepts of inside and outside, so that distinctions become invisible, or even unwanted, and boundaries become annoyances to be circumvented. A new approach to cybersecurity is needed: Organizations and individuals need to get used to operating in compromised environments. The article’s conclusion operationalize this strategy in terms of a paradigm shift away from a Castle Model and towards a more nuanced form of computation and data assurance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Compromised environments; Cyberdefense; Generational differences; Millennials; Organizational boundaries; Security",""

This usually necessitates powering down the device and taking an image of the hard drive or semi-permanent storage in the case of solid state technology. Guidelines for forensic investigations of computers advise that the computer should be shut down by removing the power supply and thereby maintaining the hard disk in the state it was in whilst running. However, valuable forensic evidence often exists in the volatile memory which is lost when this process is followed. The issues of locked accounts on running computers and encrypted files present particular difficulties for forensic investigators who wish to capture a forensic image of the RAM. This research involves freezing RAM removed from a running computer so that it can later be reinserted into an unlocked computer allowing for a forensic image of the RAM to be captured. Three different methods of cooling the RAM are compared, along with varying delays in RAM reinsertion. The results provide a guideline for forensic investigators on how the issues with locked accounts and encryption may be overcome to record this valuable evidence that is otherwise lost. © 2016 All Rights Reserved, Edith Cowan University.","Forensics; Information security; RAM","Computer crime; Cryptography; Digital devices; Electronic crime countermeasures; Locks (fasteners); Random access storage; Security of data; Solid state device structures; Cooling methods; Forensic evidence; Forensic investigation; Forensics; Memory forensics; Semi permanents; Solid state technology; Volatile memory; Computer forensics"

Classical methods of encryption inherently rely on the difficulty of solving a problem such as finding prime factors of large numbers and can, in principle, be cracked by a fast enough machine. The burgeoning field of quantum communication relies on the fundamental laws of physics to offer unconditional information security. Here we introduce the key concepts of quantum superposition and entanglement as well as the no-cloning theorem that form the basis of this field. Then, we review basic quantum communication schemes with single and entangled photons and discuss recent experimental progress in ground and space-based quantum communication. Finally, we discuss the emerging field of high-dimensional quantum communication, which promises increased data rates and higher levels of security than ever before. We discuss recent experiments that use the orbital angular momentum of photons for sharing large amounts of information in a secure fashion. © The Author(s) 2016.","","Cryptography; Photons; Quantum entanglement; Security of data; Classical methods; Entangled photons; Fundamental laws; High-dimensional; No-cloning theorem; Orbital angular momentum; Prime factors; Quantum superpositions; Quantum communication"

In some cases, missions not previously thought possible are being enabled by great capabilities in very small packages-witness the revolution in nanosatellites and microsatellites, and the business instantiation of large LEO constellations for communication and imaging built around them. New approaches to systems will be required for the currently envisioned large constellations, and new thinking about spacecraft, what they are, and what they can be will be required. Building these spacecraft for these large constellations will require efficient production and automation methods that deliver reliable spacecraft. Supplier bases will need to be expanded, or existing suppliers in industry will need to significantly expand production capability. In turn, consideration of operations, constellation management, spacecraft performance in the constellation and impacts to constellations from spacecraft failures are all items requiring exploration of new ways of “doing business” in order to meet cost targets and business needs. Questions of operating with less than the full constellation, how the constellation incorporates new members as launches occur, and exploration of autonomy in constellation performance and management will need to be addressed. Given the above, this paper explores hardware and software architecture and technology considerations both internally for the spacecraft and externally for constellations, and examines changes in thinking, approaches to operations and suppliers that may be required to have a successful small satellite ecosystem. Hardware architectures for modern spacecraft need to be similarly reflective of the pace of technology development. Architectures that capitalize on modularity to allow rapid, frequent technology refresh while allowing cross compatibility with older hardware are needed to enable some of the large scale low earth orbit constellation construction and maintenance. How we architect spacecraft systems in support of these larger constellation goals will be a consideration that is new to many of the legacy spacecraft development companies. Software architecture development and associated technology will be reviewed, along with potential problems that will require addressing, such as information assurance and cyber integrity. Architectures within which the spacecraft operates must address potential robustness and stability issues associated with spacecraft to spacecraft, spacecraft to ground communication, and spacecraft entering/departing multi-spacecraft networks. These issues could manifest in inter-spacecraft and space to ground link security, as well as “trusted membership” for spacecraft joining constellations after launch. The discussion of internal spacecraft software architectures will revolve around key design features to allow low cost maintenance across the life of a program or spacecraft product line, as well as be flexible enough to address evolving software and cyber threats and incorporation of new computing technology as hardware evolves. Architectures that are modular and reflective of software development used in the smart-phone industry will allow rapid update or enhancement of the spacecraft software and spacecraft capabilities. Backwards compatibility between generations of software in large constellations will be another item that the software architecture must address, either through true back-compatibility, or by allowing on-orbit software refresh. Working with suppliers in this new environment is then addressed. Heritage methods of supplier management, which have been focused on limited production of complex items, needs to evolve to a model that handles components in a manner similar to other large scale production of complex items, like the smart phone, tablet, or PC. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.","","Complex networks; Costs; Legacy systems; Nanosatellites; Network architecture; Product design; Smartphones; Software architecture; Software design; Space flight; Hardware and software architectures; Information assurance; Large scale productions; Low earth orbit constellations; Processing technologies; Production capabilities; Spacecraft development; Technology development; Orbits"

Many more are facing threats of stolen data and cyber-attacks. In its realization of the threats and risks that cyberattacks portend to national security and business infrastructures, government continue to expand its efforts and encourage education of the citizenry. Many firms feel that their staff are moderately or significantly deficient in data management and analysis skills. Some of the most prominent recent breaches were through staff omission or commission. Firms and government see real costs associated with a failure to come to grips with data, security priorities, lost profits and general socio-economic impacts. As firms begin to turn to buying insurance policies to mitigate data breach liabilities, lower premium will increasingly be tied to employee associated risk factors.

Similar to the process of radicalization intoextremism and terrorism, such risky insiders in IT-who are mostly lone actors (although many belong to extremist hacktivist groups)—are also radicalized-and selfradicalized-by their own version of extremist ideologies. In fact, just as jihadism became the new ideological fad of the 1980s, replacing, in its mass popularity, the previous far left radicalism ofthe 1960s and 1970s, this new IT-based extremist ideology that promotes the notion that all information (including fee-based subscriptions to information ‘carriers’ such as newspapers and music companies) should be free and accessible to everyone (including an organization’s most secret and proprietary information), has become the latest ideology to gain widespread adherents. Julian Assange, the most prominent exponent of this ideological mantra, is considered a genius software programmer and cryptographer.1 For him, even during periods of national emergency when states are threatened by terrorist groups intent on launching catastrophic attacks against infrastructure and populations, not only should countermeasures by governmental authorities be questioned and complete civil liberties and transparency be maintained at all levelsof society, including by military and intelligence organizations, but he also believes that perpetuating these organizations’ “secrets sustain[s] corruption.”2 This was his motivation for creating WikiLeaks in 2006-to be the recipient of governments’ and corporations’ secret and proprietary information, with the senders’ identities encrypted to protect them from potential disclosure and prosecution. It should be pointed out that while some of the secret and proprietary documents posted on sites such as WikiLeaks may be generated by insiders, much of the material is generated by hacktivists belonging to groups such as LulzSec and Anonymous, who surreptitiously penetrate their targeted organizations to obtain such sensitive documents in order to advance their own political agendas. Certain government programs-notably China’s offensive cyber-espionage program-have long engaged in Internet espionage against their Western adversaries in order to exploit their IT systems for secret and proprietary information.3. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Michael Fredholm; individual chapters, the contributors.

In each case, supply chain actors are working together to capture information about how and where their products are produced, aiming to provide this information to consumers. The ultimate goal in each system is the same: to demonstrate the quality of their product and earn a price premium. We find that institutional, calculative, and relational trust are used in different ways in each of the three systems, with distinct variations over time. Extrapolating from these cases, we find that providing consumers with sustainable supply chain information evolves dynamically over time with calculative trust less permanent and relational trust more permanent. Institutional trust appears to be the best way to communicate with consumers in international marketplaces. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Customer-oriented systems; Information assurance; Provenance; Social computing; Trust; User confidence",""

However, the trustworthiness of the operating system and apps is controversial. They can constitute a threat to corporate networks and infrastructures, if they are not audited or monitored. The concept of port-based authentication using IEEE 802.1X restricts access and may provide statistical data about users entering or leaving a network, but it does not consider the threat devices can pose if they have already been authenticated and used. Security information and event management (SIEM) software has to incorporate information about mobile devices during their usage. Those devices have to gather and publish information to make this possible. This can be achieved by using a client on the mobile device, which is proposed here. It collects metadata including information about device specific data, platform or system state, which is sent via multiple supported protocols to a central SIEM component, where the data is analyzed in assessment procedures for threat analysis by using artificial intelligence and rule-sets. © Research Institute for Intelligent Computer Systems, 2016.","Event detection; IEEE 802.1X; IF-MAP; Information security; Network monitoring; SIEM; TNC; Trusted network connect",""

This research work mainly focused on the desktop search. Desktop search is the specified variant of enterprise search, where the information foundations are the files stored on a personal computer, together with email and websites established on content analysis. Content Analysis is a group of manual or computer based approaches for contextualized explanations of documents. To analyze the content the different text pattern matching algorithms are used and it is used to discover all the existences of a limited set of patterns inside an input document. Commonly these algorithms are used in several applications that include information security bio-informatics, plagiarism detection, text mining and document matching. String matching is essential for finding text patterns that are in online and offline. String matching algorithm is used to matches the pattern precisely or about in the input document. The main objective of this research work is to analyze the performance of existing string matching algorithms. For this comparison there are four algorithms are used namely, Two way algorithm, Colussi algorithm, Optimal mismatch algorithm and Maximal shift algorithm. From this analysis it is observed that the Colussi string matching algorithm gives the better result.","Colussi algorithm; Desktop Search; Maximal shift algorithm; Optimal mismatch algorithm; String matching; Two way algorithm","Computer aided analysis; Data mining; Information retrieval; Pattern matching; Personal computers; Security of data; String searching algorithms; Websites; Comparative analysis; Computer-based approach; Desktop search; Enterprise searches; Pattern matching algorithms; Plagiarism detection; String matching; Two ways; Search engines"

To identify high quality services, researchers face two major challenges - the cybercriminal-specific language and the scale of the underground economy. This study presents a text-mining-based system for identifying high quality services by analyzing customer reviews. A novel supervised topic model is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous and uncertain nature of customer reviews. We further designed a variational algorithm for model inference.

Widely available connectivity provided by modern communication technology not only resulted in an increasing threat for attacks on the infrastructure but also offered possibilities like teleworking leading to new challenges in respect to system security. A variety of space projects is being operated from our multi-mission control center (GSOC), each having its own requirements regarding information security. As cost-reduction is also a key factor for space operations these days, there is a need for being able to provide information security to all of these projects in an organized and standardized way so that synergies can be used wherever possible - both in the implementation and in the operational phases of the mission. Nevertheless both the methods and processes used as well as the implemented controls must not be too rigid in order to be able to respond to mission-specific requirements resulting e.g. from different classification levels or special needs of a customer. In order to realize the aspects mentioned above, we chose the ISO/IEC 27001 standard as the baseline, guaranteeing - in contrast to national standards - international publicity and acceptance. This standard allows management of information security on a risk oriented basis. Furthermore this approach offers the opportunity to obtain a certification. In this paper we will describe how the information security management system at GSOC (ISMS) was designed and how general information security guidelines covering important aspects like secure operations, user management, secure network and much more have been developed based on ISO 27001, taking into account important processes for space operations. Using the example of the EDRS mission, we show how these general guidelines can be used to set up security concepts for upcoming space missions while taking benefit from already implemented systems. In addition to that, we explain how project-specific processes collude with the general guidelines and how special requirements can be incorporated. We will show the procedures which were evolved for managing the complete ISMS and for identifying gaps quickly, giving the opportunity to space projects to take corrective measures in order to be compliant with the security policies. Due to its flexibility, the ISMS also showed to be able to bear with the changes caused by the update of the ISO 27001 in 2013. © 2016 by the authors.

The array of physical assets, functions, and systems across which these goods and services move are called critical infrastructures.

Following the destruction and disruptions caused by the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the nation directed increased attention toward physical protection of critical infrastructures. Over the intervening years, policy, programs, and legislation related to physical security of critical infrastructure have stabilized to a large extent. However, current legislative activity has refocused on cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.

This makes a new claim to the design of encryption algorithms. Lightweight encryption algorithms are designed with the features of relatively short key length and simple algorithm structure, providing security for resource constrained devices. Lightweight encryption algorithms are seeking for the best balance between efficiency and security in the design phase. Thus, it is particularly important to analyse the optimisation of the algorithm implementation, performance evaluation and security analysis. The performance evaluation and analysis are conducted in this paper on some representative lightweight encryption algorithms in terms of computational efficiency and memory usage.

In the early days, the program was focused mainly on energy storage-especially to even out the variable power production from wind and solar technologies-but also to support large coal and nuclear power plants. The development of computer capacity and miniaturization has expanded the ability of grid operators to monitor and control electric power flows. The subsequent increase in networking of computerized devices for grid data collection and control advanced the ability of operators to anticipate, avoid, and otherwise mitigate potential power crises, such as blackouts. However, in more recent years, the computerization and networking have become vulnerable to unwanted computer-driven intrusions and disruptions, revealing a new cybersecurity challenge for electric power system technology. The nation’s energy infrastructure is diverse and complex. It includes distributed networks, varied system structures (electricity, oil, and natural gas), an array of operating models (public and private), and different systems in both the physical space and cyberspace. The energy sector consists of thousands of electricity, oil, and natural gas assets1 that are geographically dispersed and provide for all nationally important systems and networks. Thus, interdependency within the sector and across the nation’s critical infrastructure sectors is significant. Coordinating the security and resilience of energy assets is complicated by the borderless nature of energy and reliance on predominantly privately owned infrastructure. This book examines the federal oversight of electricity delivery and security. It also discusses activities and funding of electricity delivery and security.

Real-world observations from streaming data sources such as sensors, click streams, and social media are becoming increasingly common in many domains, including cybersecurity, infectious disease surveillance, social community networks, and web-based recommendation systems. An emerging approach is to leverage graph-based modeling of these events, to understand ongoing trends and predict future ones.

Hence, it is important to understand how individuals feel about the problem of cyberstalking so it can be managed in the context of cybersecurity. To do this the problem question is twofold: First, what objectives are important based on the values of the general public with regard to the prevention of cyberstalking. Second, what are the possible scenarios for the implementation of these objectives that organizations, governments and society at large can look to that will guide their decision making process. In this paper we utilize Keeney's (1990) public value forum to elicit public values which can form the basis for the decision making process in preventing cyberstalking so institutions and governments can allocate resources prudently.","Cyber security planning; Cyberstalking; Qualitative research; Strategic objectives; Values","Information systems; Societies and institutions; Cyber security; Cyberstalking; Qualitative research; Strategic objectives; Values; Decision making"

This chapter presents an asymmetric streaming cipher to encrypt real-time data units produced by an analogue-to-digital device. The robustness of the introduced one-way trapdoor function is grounded on the complexity of inverting highly non-linear Boolean permutations designed over non-commutative and non-associative algebraic structures.

The benefits of implementing the ISO 27001 are to provide market assurance and IT governance, based on customer demands and legal requirements. Although the ISO 27001 is a generic standard for all types of organisations and countries, there are still some countries that do not adopt the ISO 27001 largely. The main reason for this low adoption rate is the cultural barriers of implementing ISO 27001. The considerable influences of culture on the InfoSec have long been a topic of public and scientific interests. However, the relationship between InfoSec cultural behaviour and the ISO 27001 efficiency was unfounded. Understanding influential national cultural characteristics is considerably important for establishing a strong InfoSec culture, which is compatible with the ISO 27001 requirements. Based on the literature review, personal interviews and limited results of the preliminary survey, this study found three distinguished cultural behaviours the most applicable cultural characteristics to the ISO 27001 efficiency. This study reduces the cultural barriers of implementing ISO 27001 by enhancing required resources and insiders' cooperation in overarching employees' bypassing of defined rules and regulations.","Hofstede; InfoSec Cultural Behaviour; ISO 27001 Adoption; Withdrawn Certificate","Efficiency; Laws and legislation; Social sciences; Hofstede; Information security managements; InfoSec Cultural Behaviour; ISO 27001 Adoption; Legal requirements; Literature reviews; Rules and regulations; Withdrawn Certificate; Security of data"

The size of 3x3 non overlapping blocks have been used to determine neighborhood degree. Data hiding process is implemented by modifying the obtained neighborhood degree. Hamming distance is calculated to keep distortion in minimum level. In the selection of similar blocks with different neighborhood degrees, privacy of the algorithm is provided by using random number generators. The experimental results showed that the proposed data hiding algorithm resulted successfully.","Binary image; Data hiding; Digital watermarking; Information security; Minesweeper game; Steganography","Bins; Digital watermarking; Hamming distance; Number theory; Random number generation; Security of data; Steganography; Data hiding; Data hiding process; High capacity; Minesweeper game; Random number generators; Visual qualities; Binary images"

This book offers an interdisciplinary approach to research on cybercrime and lays out frameworks for collaboration between the fields. Bringing together international experts, this book explores a range of issues from malicious software and hacking to victimization and fraud. This work also provides direction for policy changes to both cybersecurity and criminal justice practice based on the enhanced understanding of cybercrime that can be derived from integrated research from both the technical and social sciences. The authors demonstrate the breadth of contemporary scholarship as well as identifying key questions that could be addressed in the future or unique methods that could benefit the wider research community.

The distributed networks are difficult to physically secure, legacy equipment can make cryptography and regular patches virtually impossible, and compromises can result in catastrophic physical damage. To address these concerns, this research proposes two device type fingerprinting methods designed to augment existing intrusion detection methods in the ICS environment. The first method measures data response processing times and takes advantage of the static and lowlatency nature of dedicated ICS networks to develop accurate fingerprints, while the second method uses the physical operation times to develop a unique signature for each device type. Additionally, the physical fingerprinting method is extended to develop a completely new class of fingerprint generation that requires neither prior access to the network nor an example target device. Fingerprint classification accuracy is evaluated using a combination of a real world five month dataset from a live power substation and controlled lab experiments. Finally, simple forgery attempts are launched against the methods to investigate their strength under attack. © 2016 Internet Society.","","Classification (of information); Control systems; Cybersecurity; Electric power system control; Electric substations; Embedded systems; Intrusion detection; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Device fingerprinting; Distributed networks; Fingerprinting methods; In-control; Industrial control systems; Power grids; Security challenges; Systems networks; Cyber Physical System"

Similar to DBpedia (Auer et al. 2007) which serves as the core for general knowledge in Linked Open Data cloud, we envision UCO to serve as the core for cybersecurity domain, which would evolve and grow with the passage of time with additional cybersecurity data sets as they become available.

New technologies and changes in electricity flows place increasing demands on the electric power grid. These changes include increased use of distributed (mostly renewable energy) resources, Internet-enabled demand response technologies, growing loads from electric vehicle use, continued expansion of natural gas use, and integration of energy storage devices. The Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is tasked with the lead role to address those infrastructure issues. OE is also responsible for the physical security and cybersecurity of energy infrastructure. As an illustration, OE reports that, during FY2014, its programs responded to 24 energy-related emergency events, including physical security events, wildfires, severe storms, fuel shortages, and national security events. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Despite significant legislative efforts in the 112th Congress on bills designed to improve the cybersecurity of U.S. critical infrastructure (CI), no legislation on that issue was enacted in that Congress. In an effort to address the issue in the absence of enacted legislation, the White House issued an executive order in February 2013. Citing repeated cyber-intrusions into critical infrastructure and growing cyberthreats, Executive Order 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, was an attempt to enhance security and resiliency of CI through voluntary, collaborative efforts involving federal agencies and owners and operators of privately owned CI, as well as use of existing federal regulatory authorities. Entities posing a significant threat to the cybersecurity of CI assets include cyberterrorists, cyberspies, cyberthieves, cyberwarriors, and cyberhacktivists. E.O. 13636 has attempted to address such threats by, among other things • expanding to other CI sectors an existing Department of Homeland Security (DHS) program for information sharing and collaboration between the government and the private sector, • establishing a broadly consultative process for identifying CI with especially high priority for protection; • requiring the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to lead in developing a cybersecurity framework of standards and best practices for protecting CI; and • directing regulatory agencies to determine the adequacy of existing requirements and their authority to establish additional ones to address the risks. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The order machine connects with other machines through interrupting mechanisms. This way of portraying InfoSec focuses on the correct placement of machine entities to protect information assets. However, what is missing in this view is that for the InfoSec we experience in everyday practice, we are not just observers of the InfoSec phenomena but also active agents of it. To contribute to the quest, we draw on Heidegger's (1962) notion of equipment and propose the concept of equipment-as-experience to understand the ontological position of InfoSec in everyday practice. In this paper we show how equipment-as-experience provides a richer picture of InfoSec as being a fundamental sociotechnical phenomena. We further contend using an example case to illustrate that InfoSec equipment should not be understood merely by its properties (present-at-hand mode), but rather in ready-to-hand mode when put into practice.","Equipment-as-experience; Heidegger; Information security; Ontology","Information systems; Ontology; Security of data; Active agents; Heidegger; Protect information; Sociotechnical; Equipment"

The array of physical assets, functions, and systems across which these goods and services move are called critical infrastructures (e.g., electricity the power plants that generate it, and the electric grid upon which it is distributed). The national security community has been concerned for some time about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to both physical and cyberattack. In May 1998 President Clinton released Presidential Decision Directive No. 63. The Directive set up groups within the federal government to develop and implement plans that would protect government-operated infrastructures and called for a dialogue between government and the private sector to develop a National Infrastructure Assurance Plan that would protect all of the nation’s critical infrastructures by the year 2003. While the Directive called for both physical and cyber protection from both man-made and natural events implementation focused on cyber protection against man-made cyber events (i.e. computer hackers). Following the destruction and disruptions caused by the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the nation directed increased attention toward physical protection of critical infrastructures. Over the intervening years, policy, programs, and legislation related to physical security of critical infrastructure have stabilized to a large extent. However, current legislative activity has refocused on cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. This report discusses in more detail the evolution of a national critical infrastructure policy and the institutional structures established to implement it.

However, in recent years, new threats have materialized as new vulnerabilities have come to light, and a number of major concerns have emerged about the resilience and security of the nation’s electric power system. In particular, the cybersecurity of the electricity grid has been a focus of recent efforts to protect the integrity of the electric power system. The increasing frequency of cyber intrusions on industrial control (IC) systems of critical infrastructure continues to be a concern to the electric power sector. Power production and flows on the nation’s electricity grid are controlled remotely by a number of IC technologies. The National Security Agency (NSA) reported that it has seen intrusions into IC systems by entities with the apparent technical capability “to take down control systems that operate U.S. power grids, water systems and other critical infrastructure."" As the grid is modernized and the Smart Grid is deployed, new intelligent technologies utilizing two-way communications and other digital advantages are being optimized by Internet connectivity. Modernization of many IC systems (in particular, the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition [SCADA] system) also has resulted in connections to the Internet. While these advances will improve the efficiency and performance of the grid, they also will increase its vulnerability to potential cyberattacks. Black Energy, Havex, and Sandworm are all recent examples of malware targeting SCADA systems. New devices (like smart meters) and increasing points of access (such as renewable electricity facilities) introduce new additional areas through which a potential cyberattack may be launched at the grid. Many cybersecurity actions are reactive to the last threat discovered. While intrusion detection is a priority, some experts say that mitigation of cyber threats requires a focus on attackers, not the attacks. Cybersecurity strategies may shift from figuring out whether a system has been compromised to an understanding of who authored the malicious software and why. Although malware intrusions may not have resulted in a significant disruption of grid operations so far, they still have been possible even with mandatory standards in place. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC’s) current set of standards, Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Version 5, is moving toward active consideration of bulk electric system security needs rather than just compliance with minimum standards. Electric utilities emphasize the need for timely information sharing and advocate for liability protection from potential damages resulting from a major cyber event. Some observers argue that it is the responsibility of electric utilities to embrace security as part of their strategic business planning and operations. The National Electric Sector Cybersecurity Organization has identified six failure scenario domains intended to assist utility cybersecurity efforts. These scenarios also illustrate the continuing vulnerability of the grid to potential cyber and physical attacks, or a combination of both. This report highlights several areas for congressional consideration to improve grid cybersecurity. One issue is whether electric utilities have the resources to make the financial investment and recruit staff to reduce vulnerabilities.

It encompasses the various interoperability approaches and mechanisms of health services, products and processes, combined with organizational changes in healthcare systems, with regard to interactions between patients and health-service providers, institution-to-institution data-transmission, or peer-to-peer communication between patients and/or health professionals. Since the inappropriate use or misuse of medical information can lead to undesirable outcomes, medicine and health are considered to be very sensitive areas of human life and work. It is therefore important to implement security policies, practices and procedures, as well as cyber security and defense technologies, which help to protect e-health systems against attacks, to detect abnormal activities, and to establish proven contingency plans. This work presents a framework for the security assessment of national e-health systems, which considers country-level practices and perspectives on cyber defense, information security and data protection in e-health in a holistic manner. The framework covers assessment criteria: from national security and critical infrastructures to personal data protection and user and information privacy, and various cyber security aspects in government-to-government, government-to-citizen and government-to-business categories of the e-government ecosystem. Security assessment criteria are grouped and analyzed through four interoperability aspects: legal, technical, semantic and organizational. The security assessment framework was validated and established on the Croatian e-health system, and its advantages and limitations are identified. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.

However, in recent years, new threats have materialized as new vulnerabilities have come to light, and a number of major concerns have emerged about the resilience and security of the nation’s electric power system. In particular, the cybersecurity of the electricity grid has been a focus of recent efforts to protect the integrity of the electric power system. The increasing frequency of cyber intrusions on industrial control (IC) systems of critical infrastructure continues to be a concern to the electric power sector. Power production and flows on the nation’s electricity grid are controlled remotely by a number of IC technologies. The National Security Agency (NSA) reported that it has seen intrusions into IC systems by entities with the apparent technical capability “to take down control systems that operate U.S. power grids, water systems and other critical infrastructure."" As the grid is modernized and the Smart Grid is deployed, new intelligent technologies utilizing two-way communications and other digital advantages are being optimized by Internet connectivity. Modernization of many IC systems (in particular, the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition [SCADA] system) also has resulted in connections to the Internet. While these advances will improve the efficiency and performance of the grid, they also will increase its vulnerability to potential cyberattacks. Black Energy, Havex, and Sandworm are all recent examples of malware targeting SCADA systems. New devices (like smart meters) and increasing points of access (such as renewable electricity facilities) introduce new additional areas through which a potential cyberattack may be launched at the grid. Many cybersecurity actions are reactive to the last threat discovered. While intrusion detection is a priority, some experts say that mitigation of cyber threats requires a focus on attackers, not the attacks. Cybersecurity strategies may shift from figuring out whether a system has been compromised to an understanding of who authored the malicious software and why.

A key focus is on specific countries' engagement in cyberattacks and the development of cyber-warfare capabilities. Further, the book demonstrates how a nation's technological advancement may not necessarily lead to cyber-superiority. It covers cybersecurity issues with regard to conflicts that shape relationships between major economies, and explains how attempts to secure the cyber domain have been hampered by the lack of an international consensus on key issues and concepts. The book also reveals how some economies are now facing a tricky trade-off between economically productive uses of emerging technologies and an enhanced cybersecurity profile. In the context of current paradigms related to the linkages between security and trade/investment, it also delves into new perspectives that are being brought to light by emerging cybersecurity issues. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

While information security policy is central for organizational information security, research and practitioner-oriented guidelines provide little advice on crafting such a policy. Therefore, this ethnographic study seeks to understand the crafting of an organization-wide policy in practice and the practices that lead to successful policy crafting. Drawing on ethnographic evidence from 15-month participant observation at a global corporation, the study provides insight into and suggests five implications for successful policy crafting. The implications advice managers in (1) building the foundation of their information security policy; (2) contextualizing policy's practices; (3) inviting participation of organizational members; (4) legitimizing the policy; and (5) estimating the ramifications of the policy implementation. Contributions are discussed and conclusion drawn.","Ethnography; Information security; Information security policy; Information systems security","Information systems; Managers; Security systems; Ethnographic study; Ethnography; Information security managements; Information security policies; Information systems security; Organizational information; Participant observations; Policy implementations; Security of data"

Recently, researchers have begun using malware code as data to infer directed acyclic graphs (DAG) that model the evolutionary relationships among samples of malware. A DAG is the ideal model for a phylogenetic graph because it includes the merges and branches that are often present in malware evolution. We present a novel Bayesian network discovery algorithm for learning a DAG via statistical inference of conditional dependencies from observed data with an informative prior on the partial ordering of variables. Our approach leverages the information on edge direction that a human can provide and the edge presence inference which data can provide. We give an efficient implementation of the partial-order prior in a Bayesian structure discovery learning algorithm, as well as a related structure prior, showing that both priors meet the local modularity requirement necessary for the efficient Bayesian discovery algorithm. We apply our algorithm to learn phylogenetic graphs on three malicious families and two benign families where the ground truth is known; and show that compared to competing algorithms, our algorithm more accurately identifies directed edges.

In New Zealand the percentage of the population using the internet is now 93.8% and this increase in internet usage has increased the risk of cybersecurity attacks. This makes it necessary to provide awareness and education on cybersecurity to students who are potential targets for exploitation. However, to provide this awareness it is necessary to understand what their current knowledge on cybersecurity is which forms the basis of this paper. This paper presents the results of a survey conducted on internet usage and cybersecurity awareness among three age groups between 8 years and 21 years. A questionnaire consisting of various questions on internet usage and cybersecurity concepts was prepared. For this survey, we considered both computers (desktops & laptops) and mobile devices (tablets & smartphones). The results of the survey showed that cybersecurity awareness among the surveyed students was generally low with the lowest level in the 8-12-year age group. The students of 8-12 age group were able to answer only 19% of survey questions. Furthermore, most of the students were not familiar with common cybersecurity terms and did not demonstrate enough awareness of common threats such as phishing. The results further show that the majority of the students were not aware of cybersecurity tools for tablets and smartphones which are frequently used devices for BYOD. The key contribution of this paper is to emphasise the necessity to create cybersecurity awareness among students. © 2016 IEEE.","BYOD; cybersecurity awareness; cybersecurity in education; student internet usage","Education; Internet; Smartphones; Surveys; Bring your own devices; BYOD; Cyber security; Education systems; Exponential increase; Internet usage; New zealand; Potential targets; Students"

In order to cope with these problems, this paper proposes a novel secret information hiding algorithm based on the integration of the hash function and the invisible ASCII character replacement technology. Firstly, the binary secret information is encoded with even number of '1' in each group. Secondly, the space characters in each carrier segment are replaced with 'SOH' by the replacement algorithm. Thirdly, the replaced segment is processed by the hash function. Finally, the algorithm is completed by comparing the generated hash values with the encoded secret information. Furthermore, by utilizing the hash collisions of the previous segment, the algorithm is improved to enhance the security and the embedding rate. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is feasible, effective and reliable. © 2016 IEEE.","Hash function; Information security; Invisible character replacement; Text-based information hiding","Character sets; Data privacy; Hash functions; Security of data; Semantics; Embedding rates; Hash collisions; Invisible character replacement; Replacement algorithm; Secret information; Secret information hiding; Text document; Text-based information; Big data"

Firstly, we analyze the ITSMM problem theoretically and prove that it can be transformed to a constrained maximum network flow problem. Then, based on the theoretical analysis, we model the ITSMM problem as two linear programming (LP) formulations, which can firstly obtain the maximum STR, and then find the optimal flow allocation to minimize total BC under the maximum STR guarantee.

Non-technical losses are type of commercial losses which occurs mainly on facts of electricity thefts and unmetered electricity consumption. In many countries, theft of electricity annually is estimated at billions of dollars. Despite the fact that today's electricity metering devices contain a more advanced protection against opening and mechanical action on the implementation experience of the US and European Union countries, these devices do not solve the problem of power theft. So far there is no developed a common standard security transfer and exchange data through communication channels within the network. The aim of this study is to describe vulnerabilities and possible scenarios of unauthorized disclosure and modification of information on the use of electricity in smart networks, taking into account their use in the most advanced security systems. The considered vulnerabilities are actively used by hackers. Currently, to combat the loss of revenue almost all large companies are using traditional methods: inventory, control measurements, inspections, verifications of reporting, sampling and analysis of the transactions and other. But it is impossible to use only such methods because they do not allow eliminating all causes of loss of revenue and also they are having a number of limitations. First of all, with their help, the found fact of losses is already occurred. Moreover, the time of detection of losses is far behind in time than they are actually occurred. Secondly, the application of these methods requires significant expenditure of company resources. And finally, the most significant limitations are selectivity and periodicity. © 2016 Chuhrov A.

The solving of this complex task requires to harmonize the semantics of the terminology basis of standards by modern means of representation and processing of knowledge. Analysis of publications indicates a large number of national standards directly related to information security that were developed or are processed now. There is a complex system of hierarchical relations, correlations, links and correspondences of these standards and their elements. Deep enough standardized and consolidated Ukrainian-language terminology causes different versions of the translation of the basic concepts and names deal with information security. Therefore we need to harmonize terminology base of standards on the semantic level by use of modern means of knowledge representation and processing that makes possible automated acquisition of contradictions and differences of different standards. The paper analyzes the requirements that apply to terminology and definitions of terms used in the industry terminological systems and suggests ways to meet these requirements. We propose to use the ontological analysis for formalization of the terminological system of standards deal with information security because ontologies allow interoperable and explicit integration of existing knowledge from this subject domain (from the Web open resources) with the experience of experts from standardization sphere. The availability of ontological descriptions of the standards provides quick and efficient access to relevant information and correct unambiguous interpretation of the standards' content. For this purpose the basic principles of the ontological description of standards are developed. An approach proposed in this paper is described in details on example of the standard ""Information technology - Security techniques - Security assessment of operational systems"", an ontology that defines the terms of this standard, their properties and relations is built. We consider the prospects and feasibility of establishing a global semantic web of standards which connects the individual national and international standards and their scope for knowledge-based information processing. Such network can become the basis for the reference semantic markup of various heterogeneous information resources (as natural language and multimedia), allows improving and integrating the ontologies of subject domains and provides more efficient access to information. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

The Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) encompasses the new embedded sensing capabilities of devices together with the availability of always being connected, to improve patient care whilst reducing costs. This development highlights existing security threats as well as creating new vulnerabilities, making the once comprehensive endpoint data transfer frameworks less identifiable and challenging current techniques for information security. This paper reviews the new environment using HIoT, to identify the challenges for security and the impact of this on interoperability in the healthcare setting. Each device and sensor is a potential point of vulnerability for entire networks. The low power design, limited processing and storage capabilities, together with a lack of standard interfaces will also add to the complexity of effective security solutions. Understanding these challenges is vital for anyone engaged in healthcare, as the impact of HIoT will be far-reaching for patients, clinicians, healthcare providers, and healthcare delivery.

By virtue of the IANA functions contract, the NTIA exerts a legacy authority and stewardship over ICANN, and arguably has more influence over ICANN and the domain name system (DNS) than other national governments. On March 14, 2014, NTIA announced the intention to transition its stewardship role and procedural authority over key Internet domain name functions to the global Internet multistakeholder community. To accomplish this transition, NTIA has asked ICANN to convene interested global Internet stakeholders to develop a transition proposal. NTIA has stated that it will not accept any transition proposal that would replace the NTIA role with a government-led or an intergovernmental organization solution. Internet stakeholders are engaged in a process to develop a transition proposal. While the IANA functions contract was due to expire on September 30, 2015, NTIA has the flexibility to extend the contract for any period through September 2019. NTIA expects that it will receive a final transition proposal in January 2016 with additional time necessary for review, testing, and implementation. On August 17, 2015, NTIA announced that the IANA contract will be extended for one year until September 30, 2016. Concerns have risen in Congress over the proposed transition. Critics worry that relinquishing U.S. authority over Internet domain names may offer opportunities for either hostile foreign governments or intergovernmental organizations, such as the United Nations, to gain undue influence over the Internet. On the other hand, supporters argue that this transition completes the necessary evolution of Internet domain name governance towards the private sector, and will ultimately support and strengthen the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. Legislation has been introduced in the 113th and 114th Congresses which would prevent, delay, or impose conditions or additional scrutiny on the transition. In the 114th Congress, H.R. 805/S. 1551 (the DOTCOM Act of 2015) would prohibit NTIA from relinquishing its authority until 30 legislative days after NTIA submits a report to Congress in which it certifies that the transition proposal meets certain criteria. On June 23, 2015, H.R. 805 was passed by the House. H.R. 2578 (FY2016 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act), as passed by the House, directs that NTIA may not use any FY2016 appropriated funds to relinquish its responsibility with respect to Internet domain name system functions. The proposed transition could have a significant impact on the future of Internet governance. National governments are recognizing an increasing stake in ICANN and DNS policy decisions, especially in cases where Internet DNS policy intersects with national laws and interests related to issues such as intellectual property, cybersecurity, privacy, and Internet freedom. How ICANN and the Internet domain name system are ultimately governed may set an important precedent in future policy debates-both domestically and internationally-over how the Internet should be governed, and what role governments and intergovernmental organizations should play. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

By moving data to locationtransparent centralized facilities or providers, cloud storage services offer significant economic advantages to consumers and enterprises. However, concerns have been raised regarding the duplication, dissemination, and deletion of data stored on the cloud. In addition, data leakage would be another major concern whether accidental or due to a malicious hacker attack. Thus, the formation of trust in technology is particularly essential for users to cope with the uncertainty of information privacy because users relinquish their ultimate control over the fate of their data. Trust in technology involves two major trusting mechanisms, namely cognitive trust and emotional trust. Cognitive trust, which is also known as trusting belief, refers to the users' rational expectations that the technology under scrutiny will have the necessary attributes to rely on. Three features of cognitive trust have been considered as essential elements for cloud storage applications namely, openness, consent, and access. Meanwhile, emotional trust refers to users' feeling of security and comfort to rely on the technology in use. It contains three different components, namely competence, relatedness, and autonomy. A model is proposed to depict the relationship between technology trust, perceived information privacy and security concerns. This research extends trust research on information privacy and information security concerns and enrich existing literature on the formation of trust. The results of this research could provide specific technology traits that vendors can adopt in to build up users' trust in the technology.","Cloud storage services; Cognitive trust; Emotional trust; Information privacy concerns; Information security concerns; Technology trust","Digital storage; Information systems; Personal computing; Security of data; Cloud storage services; Cognitive trust; Emotional trusts; Information privacy concerns; Technology trusts; Trusted computing"

It averaged over 100 students recruited from across the country to participate in team-based technology projects. Notable project areas include but were not limited to virtual reality, autonomy, mobile apps, cybersecurity, additive manufacturing, small unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAV) engineering, data analytics, and computing electronics to name a few.

Like other states and regions, the Oregon Department of Transportation (DOT) could benefit from the preliminary scoping, evaluation, and assessment of the impact of CVs and infrastructure and a wide range of potential cooperative system applications. With this in mind, the Oregon DOT is determining whether to pursue the next phases of federal funding for CV applications. The Oregon DOT also wants to make an informed choice about taking a national leadership role in the CV arena and to assess opportunities to join projects with other partners. This paper describes the empirical results of a survey that, to assist the Oregon DOT in its assessment, was distributed to agency staff to gauge the perception of CV and automated vehicle (AV) technology. Most respondents had heard of this technology and were in favor of its application. However, many respondents had concerns about cyber security and the catastrophic consequences of system failure, and many respondents voiced concerns about the Oregon DOT's preparedness for CVs or AVs. The Oregon DOT and other agencies can use these findings to help prepare for a better future with CVs and AVs. © 2016, National Research Council.

As such, the Internet is international, decentralized, and comprised of networks and infrastructure largely owned and operated by private sector entities. As the Internet grows and becomes more pervasive in all aspects of modern society, the question of how it should be governed becomes more pressing. Currently, an important aspect of the Internet is governed by a private sector, international organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which manages and oversees some of the critical technical underpinnings of the Internet such as the domain name system and Internet Protocol (IP) addressing. ICANN makes its policy decisions using a multistakeholder model of governance, in which a “bottom-up” collaborative process is open to all constituencies of Internet stakeholders. National governments have recognized an increasing stake in ICANN policy decisions, especially in cases where Internet policy intersects with national laws addressing such issues as intellectual property, privacy, law enforcement, and cybersecurity. Some governments around the world are advocating increased intergovernmental influence over the way the Internet is governed. For example, specific proposals have been advanced that would create an Internet governance entity within the United Nations (U.N.). Other governments (including the United States), as well as many other Internet stakeholders, oppose these proposals and argue that ICANN's multistakeholder model is the most appropriate way to govern the Internet. Currently, the U.S. government, through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) at the Department of Commerce, holds a “stewardship” role over the domain name system by virtue of a contractual relationship with ICANN. On March 14, 2014, NTIA announced its intention to transition its stewardship role and procedural authority over key domain name functions to the global Internet multistakeholder community. If a satisfactory transition can be achieved, NTIA stated that it would let its contract with ICANN expire as early as September 30, 2015. On August 17, 2015, NTIA announced that the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) contract will be extended for one year until September 30, 2016. NTIA has also stated that it will not accept any transition proposal that would replace the NTIA role with a government-led or an intergovernmental organization solution. In the 114th Congress, H.R. 805/S. 1551 (the DOTCOM Act of 2015) would prohibit NTIA from relinquishing its authority until 30 legislative days after NTIA submits a report to Congress in which it certifies that the transition proposal meets certain criteria. On June 23, 2015, H.R. 805 was passed by the House. H.R. 2578 (FY2016 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act), as passed by the House, directs that NTIA may not use any FY2016 appropriated funds to relinquish its responsibility with respect to Internet domain name system functions. The 114th Congress is likely to closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of its authority. As a transition plan is developed by the Internet community, Congress will likely monitor and evaluate that plan, and seek assurances that an Internet and domain name system free of U.S. government stewardship will remain stable, secure, resilient, and open. Congress will likely continue assessing to what extent ongoing and future intergovernmental telecommunications conferences constitute an opportunity for some nations to increase intergovernmental control over the Internet, and how effectively the Administration is working to counteract that threat. Meanwhile, in the wake of the November 13, 2015, terrorist attack in Paris, and with ongoing concern over the use of the Internet by terrorist organizations, the question has arisen whether Internet governance mechanisms could be used to combat the use of the Internet by terrorist entities. While nation-states can govern the use and content of the Internet within their own borders, there is no international governance entity that currently has authority to remove global Internet content used to promote terrorism. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Currently, the popularly used text-based information techniques are facing many problems, such as poor robustness, low embedding rate, semantic clutter and can be easily distinguished by unaided eyes. In order to solve these problems, this paper puts forward a secret information transmission scheme for English texts by using the characteristics of some invisible ASCII codes. The scheme incorporates two stages, the information hiding stage and the information extracting stage. The first stage takes the prepared carrier documents and the secret information need to be embedded as the input. Then, the information hiding procedure of the scheme will synthesize the carrier document and the secret information into a steno (shorthand) document. In the second stage, an extracting procedure will pick up the secret information when it receives the steno document that generated by the first stage. The scheme achieves hiding effects by processing the bland spaces in the English texts. The experimental results have shown that our information hiding scheme is feasible, reliable, safe and efficient. © 2016, UK Simulation Society.

Therefore, addressing the issue of information security is of great importance. This study raised questions such as what threats to and solutions for the security of EPR are proposed and prioritized by the health care staffs. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 employees of hospitals affiliated to Semnan University of Medical Sciences of Iran. A valid, reliable and anonymous self-administered questionnaire was used in this study. Results: Mean score of human factors was 2.63 and of system defects was 1.96 as EPR threats. 86(36.6%) of the participants selected codified programs, 72(30%) of them chose managerial supports, 51(21.4%) of the study subjects selected continuous monitoring and 41(17.3%) chose the development of standards as the first priorities of the EPR security solutions. Resistance in new technology acceptance and inadequate education had significant and direct relationships with the threat of human factors (B=0.359, P<0.001) (B=0.521, P<0.001). Technical factors had significant and direct relationship with the threat of systemic defects (B=0.464, P<0.001).Conclusion: Administrators, developers, and analysts of information systems in health care organizations can use these results not only to establish information systems, but also to pay more attention to the different dimensions of EPR security. In addition, they can train the staffs, to promote the organizational culture. © 2016, Institute of Integrative Omics and Applied Biotechnology.

To protect IS and information assets from insider threats, information security awareness (ISA) has been established as a crucial factor in influencing employees' behaviour that is supportive or disruptive of IS security. But yet to date, there is still a lack of in-depth and structured understanding of the factors influencing ISA. In this research-in-progress paper, we conduct a literature review to categorize determinants of ISA into four levels of origin (individual, organizational, social-environmental, and application-specific) and identify topics that are promising for future research. We then present our planned study as an example to pursue our recommendations. In the IS security context of phishing, we aim to uncover the extent to which non-IS professionals are able to develop an eye for technical aspects of IS security and pay higher visual attention to security and fraud indicators of web browsers and emails after being subject to different organizational awareness-raising activities. Among a survey and literature analysis, the multi-method approach uses the objective data collection instrument of eye tracking. We expect to contribute into the nascent area of neurosecurity research by offering new insights on the effectiveness of organizational means to increase employees' ISA.","Eye tracking; Information security; Information security awareness; Neurosecurity","Behavioral research; Information systems; Web browsers; Application specific; Eye-tracking; Information assets; Information security awareness; Literature analysis; Multi-method approach; Neurosecurity; Organizational awareness; Security of data"

The analytical and entity methodological approaches to the solution of this problem are substantiated. The scientific papers devoted to the problem of criminal and legal protection of the information and protection of the information security are studied. The legal regulation of the information protection in the international instruments and foreign legislation is examined. The availability in many foreign countries of the legislation, able to effectively counter the threat to the information security, is established. According to the author, in the Republic of Kazakhstan, operating in the field of protection of the information security is not that effective, due to the relatively small historical basis of development of the information technologies and the legal regulation of them. This causes the appeal to the advanced experience of the foreign countries. Special attention is paid by them to the protection of children from harmful information. The analysis of the legal regulation of the protection of the information security in the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan is carried out. The conclusion is made about the absence in it of the concept of the information security as a generic object of crimes, which is regarded negatively by the author. The problem of the necessity to strengthen the legal support of the information security is raised in the article. For this purpose, it is proposed to allocate it as an independent object of criminal and legal protection.

Moreover, it was verified that photon counting technique can enhance the security of DRPE algorithm. Therefore, DRPE in the Fresnel domain combining with photon counting scheme is much safer for image authentication. In this study, an image is first encrypted by DRPE in the Fresnel domain. Then, a photon-limited encrypted image is produced by using photon counting method. Finally, the decrypted image which can not be easily visualized and recognized under a limited number of photon is authenticated with a statistical nonlinear correlation algorithm.

This criterion is determined by the probability and its value, as defined in the project requirements in the design of a ""risk map"" for information security management systems. It allows you to ""risk owners"" to set acceptable risk levels and share them on acceptable and unacceptable. However, ""risk map"" operates on single events manifestations and do not consider their possible reuse (reusable) display. It concludes unconstructive design requirements for information security management system based on the concept ""to provide the level of risk that is not higher than"" Therefore, the correct design requirements formulated in the context of information security management system stream processing of risk events with a given level of risk and probability of occurrence of such events. That is shown the possibility of estimating the probability of event occurrence with the risk for a given level of acceptable risk. In other words, for a given level of acceptable risk is estimated the probability of event risks. The solution to this problem is solved by the use of concepts and methods of geometric probability. The use of the geometric approach to the estimation of the probability that the arbitrary values normalized risk acceptable risk zone, has made it possible to obtain accurate quantification of this probability. Through this approach, the subjective measure of ""risk owner"" risk appetite that is displayed in the form of an acceptable level of risk is transformed into a formal probabilistic criterion, based on which we can formulate verifiable design requirements for the establishment of information security management systems. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

It was only in 2013 that the EU and China formally expressed a common general interest in cyberspace (EEAS 2013). At the same time, both actors, with differences in content, scope and timing, have developed their own approaches to cybersecurity and the respective threats they perceive in global cyberspace. Cybersecurity policy has been on the radar of the EU for many years. It established the European Network and Information Security Agency in 2004 in order to facilitate a movement toward shared knowledge and improved “best” practice among EU member states. There was also a clear security (sub)dimension connected to the evolution of the EU’s “information society” agenda. The issue was moved up the EU’s political agenda in 2007, with NATO, the EU and other actors forced to radically rethink their approach following distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia’s public and private infrastructure. Thus the EU’s threat perception and vulnerability in relation to cybersecurity is connected to Europe’s economic transformation, as well as the social and political consequences of cybercrime, attacks on information systems and protecting cyberspace in order to ensure its effective operation in military and civilian dimensions. Cyberspace, if not secured, from an EU perspective, threatens the very existence and evolution of all Europeans across social, economic and political realms. The EU’s policy has since developed and been underpinned by the need to achieve the objectives it has set for itself in its document on the digital agenda for Europe (European Commission 2010), and equally as significant, the driving force of such an agenda, the Europe 2020 strategy (EEAS 2013). In addition, it has recognized that, as a security issue, the protection of cyberspace is borderless, and it has highlighted these issues in its policy documents and internal security strategies, including a set of principles and guidelines for internet resilience and stability (European Commission 2011) and a cybersecurity strategy (European Commission 2013). Furthermore, it has recognized the importance of working in partnership with global partners to address the civilian and military aspects of cybersecurity challenges. © Cambridge University Press 2016.","",""

The size of 3x3 non overlapping blocks have been used to determine neighborhood degree. Data hiding process is implemented by modifying the obtained neighborhood degree. Hamming distance is calculated to keep distortion in minimum level. In the selection of similar blocks with different neighborhood degrees, privacy of the algorithm is provided by using random number generators. The experimental results showed that the proposed data hiding algorithm resulted successfully.","Binary image; Data hiding; Digital watermarking; Information security; Minesweeper game; Steganography","Bins; Digital watermarking; Hamming distance; Number theory; Random number generation; Security of data; Steganography; Data hiding; Data hiding process; High capacity; Minesweeper game; Random number generators; Visual qualities; Binary images"

Thereinto, the technique of ultra-dense networks (UDNs) serves as a key enabler in meeting the roaring mobile traffic demands. With the prevalence of mobile Internet services especially those involve the mobile payment, security has gained an unprecedented amount of attention and become a highlighted feature for the fifth generation. Resource allocation, one of the most significant tools on getting over the obstacle of ubiquitous interference as well as elevating the spectrum/energy efficiency, has attracted substantial efforts, whereas not much of them consider the information security. In a word, security-oriented resource allocation is a non-ignorable field in UDNs resource management, which still needs further study. This paper takes the safety performance as the pivotal issue and refers to the core idea of physical layer security, trying to pave a way for the security design under the framework of the densified networks. In particular, a review of the classical techniques in physical layer security is given from the perspective of resource allocation, which may enlighten the security-based resource management in UDNs. Besides, the challenges as well as potential problems are identified on the basis of the characteristics of UDNs, which can be favorable for targeting the future efforts. In a case study, it is shown that effective blockage of the eavesdropper in UDNs is achievable with the aid of physical layer security, and that the spectrum efficiency is also improved through the careful resource allocation. © 2017 IEEE.","5G; information security; Resource allocation; ultra-dense networks","Efficiency; Natural resources management; Network layers; Resource allocation; Security of data; Classical techniques; Dense network; Mobile Internet services; Physical layer security; Potential problems; Resource management; Safety performance; Spectrum efficiency; Network security"

Several cybersecurity solutions have failed to protect distributed systems primarily due to asymmetric warfare with cyber adversaries. Most cybersecurity solutions have to grapple with the tradeoff between detecting one breach vs blocking all possible breaches. Current cyber threats are sophisticated and comprise of multiple attack vectors caused by organized attackers. Most of the current cyber defenses are blackbox or set-and-forget approaches which can protect against zero-day attacks and are ineffective against dynamic threats. The asymmetric conundrum is to determine which assets (software, embedded devices, routers, back end infrastructure, and dependencies between software components) need to be protected. Recently, Moving Target Defense (MTD) has been proposed as a strategy to protect distributed systems. MTD based approaches take a leaf out of the adversaries book by not focusing on fortifying every asset and make the systems move to the defender’s advantage. MTD is a game changing capability to protect distributed systems by enabling defenders to change system/network behaviors, policies, or configurations automatically such that potential attack surfaces are moved in an unpredictable manner. MTD is also a cost-effective approach for intrusion detection, active response, and recovery in distributed systems. To realize an effective MTD based defense, several challenges have to be addressed. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the challenges and proposed approaches to mitigate them. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Cost effectiveness; Intrusion detection; Military applications; Asymmetric warfares; Cost-effective approach; Distributed systems; Embedded device; Moving target defense; Potential attack; Software component; Zero day attack; Network security"

However, there are some critical security and privacy issues in database-driven CRNs, which have been rarely discussed before. First of all, in order to retrieve the spectrum available information (SAI) of one's vicinity, an SU's query will inevitably disclose its location information. Second, malicious SUs may query SAI for other locations so as to infer operational patterns of PUs and other SUs. In addition, they can reconstruct the entire SAI of the database and sell it for profit. Therefore, in this paper we aim to guarantee both location privacy of SUs and information security of the database during spectrum query in database-driven CRNs. We first leverage private information retrieval (PIR) techniques to allow the database to find out the SAI regarding a querying SU's location, without learning the query information, i.e., this SU's location. To prevent malicious SUs inferring SAI of other locations, SUs are required to provide location proofs indicating that they are at the places where they claim to be. Theoretical analysis is provided showing that our scheme is privacy-preserving and secure. Experiments are also conducted to evaluate the its efficiency. © 2016 IEEE.","","Cognitive radio; Database systems; Location; Query processing; Secure communication; Security of data; Cognitive radio network (CRN); Its efficiencies; Location information; Operational patterns; Privacy preserving; Private information retrieval; Query information; Security and privacy issues; Data privacy"

A new alternative is the graphic-based password and there has been a growing trend in the use of such a password. The human psychology study reveals that humans find it easier to remember pictures as opposed to words. There are two main aspects to the graphical password scheme, namely security and usability. This study comprises of a comprehensive research in the current Recognition-Based graphical password schemes. The common usability attributes and possible attacks on the Recognition-Based graphical password are reviewed, identified and examined in detail. There are several previous surveys on the graphical passwords. The latest research review and summarize graphical password systems concisely and at the same time, analyze usability features for every design. However it was found that there is not a single method that has the most resounding usability attributes. Therefore, this research suggests a set of usability attributes that can be applied into a single Recognition-Based graphical password system. In addition, this study examines and compares success rates on login, login time and memorability of existing systems which are the usability measures most often reported in user studies of graphical passwords. Lastly, a comparison table is revealed to put forth the limitations and strengths of each approach in terms of security and usability. Copyright © 2016 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Informational operations have been an effective instrument of impact and propaganda throughout the whole history of humanity, but nowadays they represent a crucial domain for nations and societies. Informational operations are often intended to mislead, disorient, intimidate, or force some desired opinion upon both large communities and particular individuals. In order to effectively prevent alien informational operations, forecast their effects, and plan adequate response, one needs to have clear analytical description of these operations. The problem is that informational operations represent one of the so-called weakly-structured subject domains. They are difficult to formalize, there are no benchmarks for comparison, no measurements units, no analytical value, profitability, or efficiency function, and, finally, every single information impact is, in a way, unique. Nevertheless, some formal description and forecasts are still necessary. Dissemination of informational impact can be described and analyzed by multi-agent modeling tools. However, when it comes to description and analysis of different inter-disciplinary factors and activities, related to informational operations, expert data-based multi-criteria decision support technologies seem to be the most effective means. In the process of dialogues with experts (information security specialists) informational operations can be hierarchically decomposed down to the level of elementary, manageable factors, criteria, and actions. Relative importance of these criteria and actions can be assessed based on expert or deterministic objective data. Expert estimation proves to be particularly effective for analysis of intangible, subjective, qualitative-type criteria. Expert data are collected by knowledge engineers, input into the special decision support software, called automated decision support systems, and processed using respective mathematical procedures. The final result of expert examination may vary, depending on the examination purpose. Examples include: informational operation planning or prevention, setting informational security priorities, building an informational security strategy, allocation of limited resources among information operation prevention projects, etc. The paper describes all the basic phases of decision support technology implementation in information security domain. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

Multiple technologies converged due to improvements in micro systems, wirelesse communications, sensoring and breakthroughs in software development, and all of them are enabling the Internet of Things. Networks of smart devices are implemented into people's houses and at work. The results of permanent environmental and social monitoring are already taking influences into the daily lifes. The experiences of using smart networks can also be applied on space operations. This paper describes the adaptions on basis of a flexible and agile space segment like small satellites with respect to the ground segment. It is shown in particular with a focus of the Distributed Ground Station Network (DGSN) for tracking of and communication with small satellites and cubesats. The DGSN uses a grid of ground stations with a multitude of internet connected nodes. It is based on software defined radio (SDR) to provide not only flexibility in servicing several satellites in several fequency bands, but also to be able to be used in sensoring the environmental natural and artifical electro-magnetic transmissions in the spectrum. For achieving this, the approach of combining a well known space operation ground system together with a global deployment of small and cheap ground station design uncovers the need of adopting new strategies and techniques. The paper shows aspects such as the reliability of such a network, what the level of trust amoung all peers can be, the current regulations of the International Telecommunications Union and possible cybersecurity challenges of a wide and open grid. The DGSN was started as part of the Small Satellite Design studies at the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) at the University of Stuttgart in 2012. It took part in the Google and ESA Summer of Code campaigns in 2013-2015 as well as the NASA Space Applications Challenge, where the open-source nature of the network was developed to include and foster the community in being involved right from the start. The DGSN is now a doctoral dissertation research at the Institute for Photogrammetry (IFP) at the University of Stuttgart. DGSN is currently in field testing of the prototype ground stations during which the challenges and opportunities of the IoT behaviour are studied. The results and further derivates will be presented in this paper.

The business of being a re-seller may not initially strike the reader as being relevant to cybersecurity in general, and socio-technical matters at all, but we discovered the rather vital role that such an intermediary performs through their added value and corporate ethics.Specifically, this reseller’s team of customer service agents provide advice and referral to colleagues and end customers for subject-matter expertise as well, naturally, for opportunities to up-sell - specifically with that important core of any economy: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (hereafter SMEs) - usually defined as companies with up to 250 employees. In other words, the business both responds to requests for solutions from existing customers (pull) and actively engages with customers to grow awareness about, for example, security risks in order to sell products and services (push). The authors - drawing on a background of research in corporate resilience and SMEs (with a commercial background in the IT sector) were interested to learn from an individual with his finger very firmly on the pulse of SME cyber-security awareness, just what his view was on the general level of cyber-security awareness amongst SMEs and what his company offered in the way of assistance. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, there still exist some hints to find and locate zombies even though their stealthiness and variability. To this end, one of the main concerns in designing a botnet detection system is how and which discriminating features to get. Hence, the feature extration becomes a key issue for the purpose of developing a powerful botnet detection system. In this work, we utilize three machine learning algorithms to explore which feature extration method is better between Netmate and Tranalyzer only using packet header information in case of privacy problems.

Its practical use in secure system design requires specialized knowledge about cryptography while information security is of a common concern in our society as illustrated by privacy issues caused by services using IoT devices. We propose a new concept called ""Structure-Preserving Cryptography"" in designing cryptographic applications and present concrete instantiations of structure-preserving cryptographic building blocks such as digital signatures, commitments, and so on. Structure-preserving building blocks have regulated data structure for their input and output so that they can be easily connected each other. Such high interoperability makes the task of developing secure systems easier. Besides, it reduces the cost of development and risk of having flaws due to the use of delicate cryptographic building blocks. Having a regulated data structure prohibits the use of classical mathematical properties. We overcome the difficulty by developing a novel use of mathematical properties over bilinear groups. Since the first publication of our result in CRYPTO 2010, structure-preserving cryptography has been an active research area. Several structure-preserving schemes have been studied as an interesting target of research, and they are used in number of constructions of cryptographic applications in the literature presented in top-notch international conferences.","","Cryptography; Data structures; Interoperability; Network security; Security of data; Bilinear groups; Building blockes; Cryptographic applications; Input and outputs; Mathematical properties; Secure information systems; Specialized knowledge; Structure-preserving; Historic preservation"

Increased reliance on space systems and competition over scarce space resources will only tend to worsen the cyber risks for both satellites and the data they transmit. In addition to the importance of guaranteeing that all stakeholders involved in the chain of satellite products and services adopt the technical, procedural and governance mechanisms required to address security concerns, a more structured approach from a legal point of view may also be required - otherwise, the efforts adopted in other areas may fall short of their goals due to the gaps or barriers created by the lack of a proper legal or regulatory framework. Indeed, a legal approach may contribute to set the minimum requirements for security and to clarify the legal tools that could help avoiding and or reacting to security breaches, thus contributing to creating a more trustworthy environment to the benefit of all, including States, operators, providers and end users. Currently, however, there seems that the cybersecurity threat has not been addressed in a systematic manner by regulators. On one hand, most cybersecurity strategies do not usually address satellite networks in an autonomous manner and satellite providers are not always identified as critical infrastructure suppliers in cybersecurity laws. On the other hand, the approach to attacks to data and other unincorporated elements (such as the frequencies) is still contested. This paper addresses the above issues, including the following questions: how attacks to non-physical elements of satellite systems should be dealt with and how the Tallinn Manual could contribute to defining a proper international legal regime; how can the protection of space systems be improved through legal and policy provisions, especially if cybersecurity strategies with a focus on space should be implemented; and how can regulators and authorities cooperate at the international level, including by analysing examples of international harmonisation of laws and cross-border cooperation for investigation and enforcement purposes. Lessons from the legal and policy approaches taken in cyberspace shall be learned but a specific approach shall nevertheless be considered due to the specificities of the space environment and the space law regime. A clearer approach on cybersecurity in space from a legal perspective may contribute to achieving the overall goals of security in outer space, including the promotion of its peaceful uses.

As one example, E-Health CIs are patient-centric community-serving systems that have particular regulations for information security, governance, resource management, scalability, and maintainability. We have built multiple successful E-Health interdisciplinary projects at the University of California, San Diego, including CYberinfrastructure for COmparative effectiveness REsearch (CYCORE) for cancer clinical trials, Personal Activity Location Measurement System (PALMS) for studying human activity patterns, CitiSense for sensing city pollution, and Integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and SHaring (iDASH), which is a National Center for Biomedical Computing. These CIs have served their user communities well with respect to their projects' goals and durations. Due to their shared requirements, these systems were all designed around the service bus-based Rich Services software architecture. However, there are also significant differences in how these CIs were designed and implemented, which might be informative to the community of CI developers.In this chapter, we detail our experience with developing E-Health CIs from the software quality perspective. We start from generic CI requirements along with domain and application-specific requirements, and we analyze the tradeoffs of development and deployment choices and propose a blueprint for next generation CIs. The main question that we answer is: How can we improve the quality of the next CIs by capitalizing on lessons learned, the best architectural and implementation choices, and reusing elements from previously existing systemsWe present three contributions. First, we identify a set of activities and attributes that enable us to assess the quality of a CI with regard to important maintenance activities that are common to all CIs. These activities and attributes and the way we perform the evaluation are generic and can be applied to other projects and domains. Second, we analyze multiple projects and identify a set of common requirements for CIs and applications in the E-Health domain. We separate these requirements into common requirements that apply to all CIs, E-Health specific requirements that apply to CIs and most applications in the Health domain, and application-specific requirements. This separation makes many requirements reusable, and we expect that they will inform the development of future E-Health CIs and applications. Finally, we identify a set of architectural and implementation recommendations that will help developers create higher quality CIs for the E-Health domain. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Proper identification of threats and appropriate selection of countermeasures reduces the ability of attackers to misuse the system. This paper presents a quantitative, integrated threat modeling approach that merges software and attack centric threat modeling techniques. The threat model is composed of a system model representing the physical and network infrastructure layout, as well as a component model illustrating component specific threats. Component attack trees allow for modeling specific component contained attack vectors, while system attack graphs illustrate multi-component, multi-step attack vectors across the system. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is leveraged to provide a standardized method of quantifying the low level vulnerabilities in the attack trees.

Our research indicates that both state and federal regulations helps to reduce breaches but their combined effect is more significant on reducing them. The effect of increased set of regulations in finance and healthcare industries like PCI and HITECH Act have been studied in this research.

Telemedicine also referred as eHelath stresses on the critical factor of 'distance'; grapples with existing technology and seeks advancement, application of technology. Though 'guidelines' for tele-consultation in government sponsored TM programs are in place in India, neither the Central government nor any state in India has yet developed any act, law or regulations for TM. Though there has been no legal case so far arising out of TM practice, the lack of such laws seem to hinder the growth of practitioners, occasionally. Notable legal challenges include Liability for Patient Damages and Security of Patient Health Information. As the laws around the subject are not specific to the concept, but relate to the practitioners and the users, the need for a comprehensively binding structure can be felt in the present times. India has laws governing different aspects of medical practice and information security and the existing provisions of law seem adequate to confront any potential legal issues arising in this context. With growing involvement of diverse stakeholders including private and commercial ones, the need for change/redefinition of the laws exclusively for the purpose of Telemedicine practice seem imminent. While the developed countries like the United States are shifting their focus towards the protection of privacy and security issues in handling and management of patient data, the developing countries are still looking for technical solutions. Though there have been some attempts and suggestions for a Telemedicine Act in India, none exists today. Critically probing the need and required focus areas along with the developments so far, an analysis of the Laws elsewhere will be carried out for drawing-up suitable and comprehensive legal framework for India. The framework encompasses not only an act but the law, guidelines and any other advisories and even the need for potentially leading to the establishment of a Competent Authority. This paper will also examine how close cooperation between the nations could help achieve general norms and guidelines which could stand open to adoption into sui generis models. The work may be useful as a reference for other developing countries adopting the TM practice for universal healthcare.","","Developing countries; Health care; Hospital data processing; Patient monitoring; Satellite communication systems; Security of data; Space research; Telemedicine; Central government; Communication technologies; Competent authorities; Developed countries; Protection of privacy; Satellite communications; Technical solutions; Telemedicine networks; Laws and legislation"

Regardless of the efforts, security threats, incidents, vulnerabilities, and risks are still plaguing many organisations. Lack of awareness of ISM effectiveness due to low understanding of the success factors is one of the major factors that cause this phenomenon. This study aimed to address this subject by firstly identifying the ISM key factors from existing literature and then by confirming the factors and discovering other related factors from practitioners' perspective. This study used a qualitative method where it adopted semi-structured interviews involving nine practitioners. The data were analysed using content analysis technique. Through the analysis, the study validated several ISM factors and their elements that contribute to the success of ISM.

Here we model the security controls selection problem as a two-stage decision making: First, managers and information security officers define the size of security budget. Second, the budget is distributed between various types of security controls. By viewing loss prevention with security controls measured as gains relative to a baseline (losses without applying security controls), we formulate the decision making process as a classical portfolio selection problem. The model assumes security budget allocation as a two objective problem, balancing risk and return, given a budget constraint. The Sharpe ratio is used to identify an optimal point on the Pareto front to spend the budget. At the management level the budget size is chosen by computing the trade-offs between Sharpe ratios and budget sizes. It is shown that the proposed two-stage decision making model can be solved by quadratic programming techniques, which is shown for a test case scenario with realistic data. © 2016 The Authors.","multicriteria optimisation; portfolio optimization; security; security budget; Sharpe ratio; subset selection","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Financial data processing; Information management; Information systems; Loss prevention; Multiobjective optimization; Project management; Quadratic programming; Security of data; Multi-criteria optimisation; Portfolio optimization; security; Security budget; Sharpe ratios; Subset selection; Budget control"

From database schemas, it is not only possible to infer the information being collected but also the way organizations manage their businesses and/or activities. One of the ways to disclose database schemas is through the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) expressions. In fact, their use can follow strict security rules or be unregulated by malicious users. In the first case, users are required to master database schemas. This can be critical when applications that access the database directly, which we call database interface applications (DIA), are developed by third party organizations via outsourcing. In the second case, users can disclose partially or totally database schemas following malicious algorithms based on CRUD expressions. To overcome this vulnerability, we propose a new technique where CRUD expressions cannot be directly manipulated by DIAs any more.

The statistical analysis allows creating a set of objects for the deterministic (logical) analysis. As deterministic methods demand large volumes of calculations, preliminary statistical processing allows to reduce volumes of data for the deterministic (logical) analysis. In the paper, deterministic methods are presented by analogs of search of causal relationships. Application of heuristic and plausible reasonings can generate doubtful conclusions which are connected with random character of source data. Therefore, the analysis of random generation of deterministic conclusions is considered. The suggested methods of the analysis are focused on two-level architecture of information security system in cloudy computing environments. In this architecture, a slow automatic data mining generates at the top level fast reaction for resolution of conflicts in computing processes or identification of malicious code functioning.","Cloudy computing environments; Heuristic algorithms; Information security; Mutual influence of data; Probabilistic and statistical and deterministic (logical) methods of the analysis",""

In MSS, enterprises contract a security firm such as Symantec or IBM to manage security of their enterprise network. MSS vendors thus have a small pool of cybersecurity analysts who must monitor many different alerts. In this paper, we study the problem of allocating cybersecurity analysts to alerts generated by intrusion detection systems and other security software. In particular, given an enterprise network (or set of enterprise networks) and information about the value of assets stored at a node (e.g. computer, router) in the network, together with probabilities of compromising a neighbor of a compromised vertex, we show that annotated probabilistic temporal (APT) logic programs allow a defender to express knowledge about the network that captures the probabilities that different nodes will be attacked. In addition, certain APT logic computations, in conjunction with a Stackelberg game theoretic formalization, enable us to capture the attacker's maximal probability of success as well as his ability to maximize damage. We show how the defender can come up with optimal allocations of tasks to cybersecurity analysts, taking both network information into account as well as a behavioral model of the attacker into account. We show correctness and complexity theorems for both the attacker and the defender. We develop a prototype implementation of three algorithms for the defender that optimize the defender's objectives and show that these algorithms work well on realistic network sizes. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

In Prevention phase, care is taken so that attack should not occur. But most of the times it is not possible to prevent attacks, so it is very important to detect them as early as possible so that these will not harm a lot to wireless sensor network and that phase is called as intrusion detection. Once Intrusion has been detected we have to take actions to cure from it and it is called as mitigation. So, Intrusion detection is most important phase as far as security of wireless sensor network is concerned.

While these interruptions provide timely information, research shows they come at a high cost in terms of increased stress and decreased productivity. This is due to dual-task interference (DTI), a cognitive limitation in which even simple tasks cannot be simultaneously performed without significant performance loss. Although previous research has examined how DTI impacts the performance of a primary task (the task that was interrupted), no research has examined the effect of DTI on the interrupting task. This is an important gap because in many contexts, failing to heed an alert-the interruption itself-can introduce critical vulnerabilities. Using security messages as our context, we address this gap by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how (1) DTI occurs in the brain in response to interruptive alerts, (2) DTI influences message security disregard, and (3) the effects of DTI can be mitigated by finessing the timing of the interruption. We show that neural activation is substantially reduced under a condition of high DTI, and the degree of reduction in turn significantly predicts security message disregard. Interestingly, we show that when a message immediately follows a primary task, neural activity in the medial temporal lobe is comparable to when attending to the message is the only task. Further, we apply these findings in an online behavioral experiment in the context of a web-browser warning. We demonstrate a practical way to mitigate the DTI effect by presenting the warning at low-DTI times, and show how mouse cursor tracking and psychometric measures can be used to validate low-DTI times in other contexts. Our findings suggest that although alerts are pervasive in personal computing, they should be bounded in their presentation. The timing of interruptions strongly influences the occurrence of DTI in the brain, which in turn substantially impacts alert disregard. This paper provides a theoretically grounded, cost-effective approach to reduce the effects of DTI for a wide variety of interruptive messages that are important but do not require immediate attention. © 2016 INFORMS.","Amazon Mechanical Turk; Dual-task interference; FMRI; Information security; Laboratory experimentation; Multitasking; NeuroIS; Security message","Cost effectiveness; Magnetic resonance imaging; Multitasking; Neurons; Personal computing; Security of data; Tensors; Ubiquitous computing; Amazon mechanical turks; Dual-task interference; FMRI; NeuroIS; Security messages; Functional neuroimaging"

To ensure the completeness of checks to detect vulnerabilities in the source code, the use of heuristic (signature) method for analysis of software security, which takes into account a full range of classes of software security weaknesses, is justified. A semantic metamodel for the description of heuristic algorithms for detecting software security vulnerabilities and weaknesses at different levels of the source code presentation has been developed. It is noted that the most prospective models for software presentation from the point of view of security are an abstract syntax tree and an abstract semantic graph. It is shown that the necessary level of a response rate, formal simplicity and visualization of the heuristic analysis can be achieved by the use of a production system. Examples of particular semantic models of heuristics for identifying actual classes of software security weaknesses are presented. Advantages and limitations of the solutions offered are noted. Data on implementation and approval of proposed solutions in practice are provided. It is pointed out that, in certification testing of information protection systems, 88% of critical vulnerabilities were identified by the heuristic analysis. It was concluded that the heuristic analysis may form a basis for different methods of the source code security audit.","Defects; Heuristic analysis; Information security; Production models; Software security; Static analysis; Testing; Undocumented features; Vulnerabilities; Weaknesses",""

While there exist many approaches towards securing data for the purpose of dissemination, the vast majority follows the traditional thought of security engineering that occurs as the last step of the overall software engineering process. In this paper we extend the Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard to: (1) modeling tree-structured data and associated schemas and (2) information security via role-based, lattice-based, and discretionary access control; both push it towards the forefront of the software development life-cycle. Tree structured data and associated schemas are dominant in information modeling and exchange formats including: the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), etc. New UML artifacts for tree-structured data and schemas would allow the modeling of generalized information solutions from which XML, JSON, RDF, etc., could be generated; this is akin to generating different object-oriented programming language code from UML class diagrams. This UML extension also allows security experts to model and define information security requirements at the schema level as well, before code is written. The end-result is the assurance of information security for the purpose of sharing across computational systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Access control; Computer software; Forestry; Hypertext systems; Information science; Life cycle; Modeling languages; National security; Object oriented programming; Security of data; Software design; Software engineering; Standardization; XML; Discretionary access control; Extensible Mark-Up language (XML); Health care informatics; Information security requirements; JavaScript object notations (JSON); Software development life cycle; Software engineering process; Tree-structured data; Unified Modeling Language"

Using a proprietary protocol or encoding format is a way to improve information security. However, the flow, which carried by proprietary protocol or code, cannot go through the traditional IP network. In addition, ultra-high-definition video transmission service once again become a hot spot. Traditionally, in the IP network, the Serial Digital Interface (SDI) signal must be compressed. This approach offers additional advantages but also bring some disadvantages such as signal degradation and high latency. To some extent, HD-SDI can also be regard as a proprietary protocol, which need transparent transmission such as optical channel. However, traditional optical networks cannot support flexible traffics. In response to aforementioned challenges for future network, one immediate solution would be to use NFV technology to abstract the network infrastructure and provide an all-optical switching topology graph for the SDN control plane. This paper proposes a new service-based software defined optical network architecture, including an infrastructure layer, a virtualization layer, a service abstract layer and an application layer. We then dwell on the corresponding service providing method in order to implement the protocol-independent transport. Finally, we experimentally evaluate that proposed service providing method can be applied to transmit the HD-SDI signal in the software-defined optical network. © 2016 SPIE.","NFV forwarding graph; protocol independent; SDON","Application programs; Big data; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Digital television; Distributed computer systems; Fiber optic networks; Fiber optic sensors; Image communication systems; Information management; Internet service providers; Light transmission; Network architecture; Optical communication; Optical data storage; Optical fiber communication; Optical fibers; Optical switches; Security of data; Topology; Ubiquitous computing; Cloud computing technologies; Network infrastructure; NFV forwarding graph; Proprietary protocols; SDON; Transparent transmission; Ultra high definitions; Virtualization layers; Internet protocols"

The objective of the monitoring problem is to maximize the benefit of monitoring minus the monitoring cost. The key trade-off in our model is that as more sessions are monitored, the attack costs should decrease. However, the monitoring cost would likely increase with the number of sessions being monitored. A key step in solving the problem is to derive the probability density of a system with n sessions being monitored with a session's age measured as the time elapsed since it last generated a suspicious event. We next optimize the number of sessions monitored by trading off the attack cost saved with the cost of monitoring. A profiling step is added prior to monitoring and a resulting two-dimensional optimization problem is studied. Through numerical simulation, we find that a simple size-based policy is quite robust for a very reasonable range of values and, under typical situations, performs almost as well as the two more sophisticated policies do. Also, we find that adopting a simplified policy without using the option of managing sessions using age threshold can greatly increase the ease of finding an optimal solution, and reduce operational overhead with little performance loss compared with a policy using such an option. The insights gained from the mechanics of profiling and monitoring are leveraged to suggest a socially optimal contract for outsourcing these activities in a reward-based contract. We also study penalty-based contracts. Such contracts (specifically, when the penalty is levied as a percentage of the monthly service fee) do not achieve the social optimum. We show how an appropriate penalty coefficient can be chosen to implement a socially optimal penalty-based contract. In addition, we provide a high-level comparison between rewardand penalty-based contracts. In a penalty-based contract, the setting of the fixed payment can be challenging because it requires additional knowledge of the total expected malicious event rate, which needs to be observed through a period of no monitoring. © 2016 INFORMS.","IT security; Monitoring and profiling; Optimization; Outsourcing","Costs; Economic and social effects; Optimization; Outsourcing; Probability density function; Problem solving; Security of data; Additional knowledge; IT security; Operational Overheads; Optimal solutions; Penalty coefficient; Probability densities; Security monitoring; Two dimensional optimizations; Monitoring"

The information security and safety equipment of different users is an important issue that we have to consider. Role-based access control introduces the roles concept into user and access rights, and its basic feature are that divide roles depending on the security policy, assign operating license for each role, and assign roles to each user. The user can access the specified object based on their respective roles. In order to achieve different user needs for security, aquaculture access control model based on group/role is developed which is based on analysis of the role-based access control model. Aquaculture intelligent monitoring and management system consists of system administrators, business users, family farming users and technicians, each category contains a number of other users who have different permissions. For such a complex distribution of competences, the user groups are introduced here on the basis of idea of role-based access control model. Users are divided into four groups which correspond to four categories of users, each group is given the largest collection of operational authority, and the users of each group are assigned different roles, which have all or part of privileges of the current group. Technicians can access business and family farming user’s information, but cannot view some sensitive data, such as price, therefore, technicians group is controlled by field-level permissions of data tables, the sensitive fields of business and family farming user data tables is shielded. This model can effectively reduce the overhead of rights management, and can improve system’s scalability. Along with the needs of business development, the system can easily add new user groups and assign permissions and roles for them. This aquaculture access model is universal, it is not only suitable for aquaculture intelligent monitoring and management system but also has reference value for other systems. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.","Access control; Aquaculture; Group; Permission; Role","Agriculture; Aquaculture; Information management; Monitoring; Security of data; Access control models; Group; Intelligent monitoring; Permission; Role; Role-based Access Control; Role-based access control model; Web information systems; Access control"

We must address several privacy and security challenges to realize true potential of Big Data for information security. The paper analyzes Big Data applications for information security problems, and defines research directions on Big Data analytics for security intelligence. Traditional encryption solutions can protect the data but they can't be used to compute on encrypt data, however a novel encryption scheme, called fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), could compute over encrypted data without decrypting it. Extracting valuable information from attributes by evaluating them is the main goal of analyzing big data which need to be protected. Since, it is impossible to protect all big data, we consider big data as a single object which has its own attributes, and the set of attribute which have a higher relevance is more important than other attributes.

In this study, a new and secure method for image encryption is proposed. This method is implemented firstly by doing a circular rotation (right and left) operation on all pixels of the image; each row in the image is rotated number of times depending on number of row. Secondly, making a sequential XOR operation between the pixels in the image and secret key. During the encryption phase, the two operations are repeated several times. On the other hand, the proposed system uses hybrid generator to generate initial secret key. The hybrid generator is based on the combination of Pless and Groth generators algorithms to increase the complexity on attackers which improves the security In order to evaluate the security and performance of the proposed system, the recorded results from applying it on images are analyzed using statistical analysis, key space analysis and key sensitivity analysis. According to experimental results, the proposed method has the best performance with lower MSE, higher PSNR, higher entropy and the correlation was significantly decreased. Also the results showed that the method is sensitive to any changes in the secret key.

We collect and analyze IP packets from adversary, and derive network topology map of adversary. The characteristics of topology map can be analyzed by the eigenvalue of topology matrix.

One way to ensure the security is by de- ploying an intrusion detection system (IDS), which some of them employs machine learning methods, such as k-nearest neighbor. Despite its strength for detecting intrusion, there are some factors, which should be improved. In IDS, some re- search has been done in terms of feature generation or feature selection. However, its performance may not be good enough. In this paper, a method to increase the quality of the generated features while maintaining its high accuracy and low compu-Tational time is proposed. This is done by reducing the search space in training data. In this case, the authors use distance between the evaluated point and the centroid of the other clus-Ters, as well as the logarithmic distance between the evaluated point and the subcentroid of the respective cluster. Besides the performance, the effect of homogeneity in extracting cen-Troid and subcentroid on the accuracy of the detection model is also evaluated. Based on conducted experiment, authors find that the proposed method is able to decrease processing time and increase the performance. In more details, by us- ing NSL-KDD 20% dataset, there is an increase of 4%, 2%, and 6% from those of TANN in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Similarly, by using Kyoto 2006 dataset, proposed method rises 1%, 3%, and 2% than those of TANN.","Clustering; Feature transformation; Information security; Network security",""

Often these classes can be linked to a mutually shared vulnerability. Shared vulnerabilities may be due to a shared eavesdropper or correlated failures. In this paper, we show the impact of shared vulnerabilities on robust connectivity and how the heterogeneity of node classes can be exploited to maintain functionality by utilizing multiple paths. Percolation is the field of statistical physics that is generally used to analyze connectivity in complex networks, but in its existing forms, it cannot treat the heterogeneity of multiple vulnerable classes. To analyze the connectivity under these constraints, we describe each class as a color and develop a ""color-avoiding"" percolation. We present an analytic theory for random networks and a numerical algorithm for all networks, with which we can determine which nodes are color-avoiding connected and whether the maximal set percolates in the system. We find that the interaction of topology and color distribution implies a rich critical behavior, with critical values and critical exponents depending both on the topology and on the color distribution. Applying our physics-based theory to the Internet, we show how color-avoiding percolation can be used as the basis for new topologically aware secure communication protocols. Beyond applications to cybersecurity, our framework reveals a new layer of hidden structure in a wide range of natural and technological systems.","","Color; Solvents; Topology; Color distribution; Correlated failures; Critical behavior; Critical exponent; Numerical algorithms; Robust connectivities; Statistical physics; Technological system; Complex networks"

For example, it is necessary to intersect elements of a large set of Boolean vectors of large length to find fixed points of so-called Galois closure. An advanced algorithm of Galois closure formation is introduced. The algorithm is used to optimize the process of set closeness checking.

Among mobile applications, those that interact with social network profiles, have a great potential for development, as they intercept another powerful asset of the today cyberspace. However, one of the problems that can limit the diffusion of social network applications is the lack of fine-grained control when an application use the APIs of a social network to access a profile. For instance, in Twitter, the supported access control policy is basically on/off, so that if a (third party) application needs the right to write in a user profile, the user is enforced to grant this right with no restriction in the entire profile. This enables a large set of security threats and can make (even inexpert) users reluctant to run these applications. To overcome this problem, we propose an effective solution working for Android Twitter applications based on a middleware approach. The proposed solution enables other possible benefits, as anomaly-based malware detection leveraging API-call patterns, and it can be extended to a multiple social network scenario. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Android; Application security; Fine-grained access control; OAuth; Twitter","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Malware; Middleware; Mobile computing; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Security of data; Social networking (online); Android; Application security; Fine grained; OAuth; Twitter; Access control"

An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a systematic approach for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving an organization's information security. Key elements of the operation of an ISMS are ISMS processes. However, and in spite of its importance, an ISMS process framework with a description of ISMS processes and their interaction as well as the interaction with other management processes is not available in the literature. Cost benefit analysis of information security investments regarding single measures protecting information and ISMS processes are not in the focus of current research, mostly focused on economics. This article aims to fill this research gap by proposing such an ISMS process framework as the main contribution. It is based on a set of agreed upon ISMS processes in existing standards like ISO 27000 series, COBIT and ITIL. Within the framework, identified processes are described and their interaction and interfaces are specified. This framework helps to focus on the operation of the ISMS, instead of focusing on measures and controls. By this, as a main finding, the systemic character of the ISMS consisting of processes and the perception of relevant roles of the ISMS is strengthened. © 2016, SciKA.","Information security; ISMS; IT security management; Process framework",""

For embedding watermark, the generation principle and distribution features of direct current (DC) coefficient are utilized to directly modify the pixel values in the spatial domain, then 4 different sub-watermarks are embedded into different areas of the host image for four times, respectively. When extracting watermark, the sub-watermark is extracted with blind manner according to DC coefficients of watermarked image and the key-based quantization step, and then the statistical rule and “first to select, second to combine” are proposed to form the final watermark. Hence, the proposed algorithm not only has the simple and quick performance of the spatial domain but also has the high robustness feature of DCT domain. Many experiments have proved the proposed watermarking algorithm has good invisibility of watermark and strong robustness for many added attacks, e.g., JPEG compression, cropping, adding noise, etc. Comparison results also have shown the preponderances of the proposed algorithm. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Combine domain; DC; Digital watermarking; Information security","Cloud computing; Digital watermarking; Image compression; Security of data; Blind digital image watermarking; Distribution features; Embedding watermarks; Extracting watermarks; Generation principles; Image watermarking algorithm; Watermarked images; Watermarking algorithms; Image watermarking"

We employed a qualitative, focus group data collection approach, which enabled rich discussion with InfoSec experts. Fifteen InfoSec experts were asked: ""What naïve and accidental behaviours could compromise the information security of an organisation?"" They brainstormed, discussed and rated the most important behaviours. According to these experts, the three most important behaviours were sharing passwords, not considering the consequences of Social Media (SM), and oversharing information on SM. It was also found that, of the eleven most important behaviours, rated by the InfoSec experts, eight were part of the HAIS-Q. Furthermore, discussions emphasised the notion of human naivety, lending support to the focus on naïve and accidental behaviours.

For the correlation between adjacent pixels of an image is highly close, the shadow images will reveal the shapes of the original secret image after performing sharing process directly. Currently, the common method is using a permutation function, which is based on a cryptographic key, to permute the pixels of the secret image before sharing process. Then to safeguard the key brings a new problem. It is attractive to find a way to disrupt the correlation between neighboring pixels of an image. In this paper, pixel field is established to break up the correlation between adjacent pixels and it can reconstruct the secret image precisely based on pixel field in this paper.

For the purposes of this study, ISA is a measure of an employee's knowledge of, and attitude towards, their organisation's Information Security (InfoSec) policies and procedures. This study used a web-based survey research method by utilising modules of the HAIS-Q. Individual knowledge and attitude were assessed for 198 bank employees and 500 general workforce participants. Seven InfoSec focus areas were evaluated: Password management, email management, internet use, social media use, mobile computing, information handling and incident reporting. It was found that the levels of ISA for bank employees were approximately 20% better than those for the general workforce, in all InfoSec focus areas.

The rapid evolution of usage of resources based on the need of the users paved the way for seeking this new technology. Since all the users rush up in accessing the resources provided by the cloud, more complexity lies on storing the users' data in a secured way in clouds. Cloud Security issues force the users as well as providers to propose more security related solutions. Data Security is the most vital among all security issues in the cloud. This data security can be ensured by Confidentiality. To achieve this confidentiality, the data has to be encrypted before it is sent to the cloud environment. Cryptography is the methodology introduced in the last decades for attaining Information Security. To avoid the attacker or intruder to predicate the pattern used to secure the data, the speed of the encryption and decryption processes have to be increased, and the key used for the processes has to be strengthened. Two cryptographic mechanisms, namely, Symmetric Key and Asymmetric Key algorithms are used for encryption and decryption processes. Among these two, Asymmetric key cryptography also termed as Public key cryptography is widely used now-a-days because it is not necessary to prevent the key from the public whose performance and speed is more or less equal to that of symmetric key algorithms. RSA is one of the widely used asymmetric key encryption algorithm. The proposed work brings the data security in cloud by enhancing the RSA algorithm. It uses prime numbers for encryption and decryption processes. The proposed algorithm outperforms the standard RSA. © International Science Press.","Cloud computing; Confidentiality; Data security; Public key cryptography; RSA",""

In a kinetic military context, collateral damage occurs when a hostile action causes physical or property damage to a civilian target. However, collateral effects caused by cyber operations lack formal recognition when they are limited to electronic data, information technology and computing systems, whether caused by conventional military operations, or the result of law enforcement, or private sector operations. Even though there may be tangible consequences stemming from the loss or destruction of data, conventional norms are ill equipped to formally recognize them. Uniquely in the cybersecurity context, tactical operations may have broad systemic ""collateral"" effects on other important policy priorities that must be accounted for. In short, we lack a clear conceptual vocabulary for cyber operations for both the military operations, as well as for non-military operations, where many cyber activities occur. This research examines this discontinuity by first examining conventional military definitions of ""cyber operations,"" ""collateral damage"" and international norms governing operations conducted by lawful participants against military targets. It then examines a number of important similarities and differences between conventional and cyber operations as they relate to damage and injury. Finally, it introduces other contexts for considering collateral damage in the cyber realm, and the way in which other legal and strategic regimes have handled the concept, providing specific examples of these outcomes and guidance for how to think about collateral damage in a range of contexts. © 2016 Author.","Collateral damage; Cyber; Cyber-physical; Laws of armed conflict","Adaptive systems; Military operations; Armed conflict; Collateral damage; Collateral effects; Cyber; Cyber operations; Cyber physicals; Military targets; Technical assessment; Damage detection"

The purpose of this paper is to present a cryptographic algorithm based approach to integrate the security aspect in business rules modeling. We propose integrating an agent-based approach in the framework. This solution utilizes a security agent with domain ontology. This agent applies an encryption/decryption algorithm to allow for the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the most important rules.

A particular aspect to be considered is the Risk Analysis and, specifically, the analysis of the Systemic Risk. This risk derives from the interdependence of the system under consideration, from services provided by other systems and, in general, from the interactions among them. In fact, it may happen that an adverse event, which occurs at a certain system that is not properly controlled, can cause dangerous effects that, through its propagation to other interconnected systems, would/could compromise their operation. Thus, suitable engineering approaches need to be exploited to prevent and manage the risks arising from the integration of system components so as to increase the security of systems, data and even human life. In this context, the paper proposes specific extensions of a Goal Oriented methodology for Requirement Modeling, called GOReM, through the RAMSoS method, natively conceived for supporting dependability analysis. Such combination enables the modeling and the evaluation of the Systemic Risk centered on agent-based simulation techniques. The combination of RAMSoS and GOReM is experimented on a case study concerning an online payment service, by evaluating the impact of the failure of a single component on the overall system. © held by the authors.","Cybersecurity; Modeling and Simulation; Requirement engineering; Systemic risk analysis","Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Systems engineering; Agent based simulation; Cyber security; Dependability analysis; Goal oriented methodologies; Heterogeneous systems; Model and simulation; Requirement engineering; Systemic risks; Information management"

Then the client PC replaces the original privacy file with a Virtual Synchronized File termed VSF. From the users' perspective, the VSF alleviates the inconveniences and maximizes efficiency of personal information management as it (1) allows the users to access to the privacy files in a transparent manner in comparison to an access scheme for a normal document file; (2) internally performs encryption/decryption for the file; and (3) separately stores the files with minimized users' interventions.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors perform a formal information security field study using a representative sample. Using the Control Objectives for IT (COBIT) framework, the authors evaluate 67 information security controls and perform 206 related tests. The authors state six hypotheses about the findings and accept or reject those using inferential statistics. The authors explain findings using the social comparison theory and the rare events bias theory. Findings - Only one-third of all the controls examined were designed properly and operated as expected. About half of the controls were either ill-designed or did not operate as intended. The social comparison theory and the rare events bias theory explain managers's reliance on small experience samples which in turn leads to erroneous comprehension of their business environment, which relates to information security. Practical implications - This information is valuable to executive branch policy makers striving to reduce information security vulnerability on local and national levels and small business organizations providing information and advice to their members. Originality/value - Information security surveys are usually over-optimistic and avoid self-incrimination, yielding results that are less accurate than field work.

A primary finding from previous research indicates more robust and reliable autonomy of the RPA is the backbone of these machines realizing their full potential. Major roadblocks to obtaining the necessary level of autonomy to include reliable and integrated communications, cybersecurity and fail-safe ""sense and avoid"" methodology. Our research has further developed the technical, safety and operational goals that must be met for RPAs of the future to become economically feasible and take their place in everyday society. First we developed a more robust and up-to-date basis of technology for each of these areas of interest. Comparing these updated data to our earlier findings related to multi-sensor ""sense and avoid (S&A)"" capability as well as projected operational scenarios we developed an algorithm for a generic RPA to utilize integrated sensors to detect, localize and make response decisions to ensure necessary machine maneuvers are performed in time to avoid the detected object. Simultaneous notification of control authorities are a function triggered as a part of the decision/response logic. Using a well defined decision/ response algorithm we next looked for specific system functions and hardware interfaces to off-board sensors to identify possible cybersecurity attack vulnerabilities. Both NextGen and SESAR plan to implement new operational concepts and make use of surveillance sources such the Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) and the new systems such Automatic Collision Avoidance System (ACAS -X). The results will be a multiplicity of useful information that could be fed into the airspace. Final conclusions of this research are presented to show concentrated areas of concern that must be considered by RPA system designers as well as control system developers and remote air traffic controllers.","","Air traffic control; Aircraft accidents; Control theory; Flight control systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Air traffic controller; Automatic dependent surveillance - broadcasts; Collision avoidance systems; Control authorities; Economic feasibilities; Operational concepts; Operational scenario; Remotely piloted aircraft; Fighter aircraft"

Optimality is measured with respect to the overall (1) monetary cost of implementation, (2) negative side-effects of cyber-security controls (indirect costs), and (3) mitigation of the cyber-security risk. We consider ""passive"" and ""reactive"" threats, the former representing the case where attack attempts are independent of the defender’s plan, the latter, where attackers can adapt and react to an implemented cyber-security defense. Moreover, we model in three different ways the combined effect of multiple cyber-security controls, depending on their degree of complementarity and correlation. We also consider multi-stage attacks and the potential correlations in the success of different stages. First, we formalize the problem as a non-linear multiobjective integer programming.We then convert them into Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP) that very efficiently solve for the exact Paretooptimal solutions even when the number of available controls is large. In our case study, we consider 27 of the most typical security controls, each with multiple intensity levels of implementation, and 37 common vulnerabilities facing a typical SME. We compare our findings against expert-recommended critical controls. We then investigate the effect of the security models on the resulting optimal plan and contrast the merits of different security metrics. In particular, we show the superior robustness of the security measures based on the ""reactive"" threat model, and the significance of the hitherto overlooked role of correlations. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Economics; Risk assessment; Security of data; Security systems; Different stages; Mixed integer linear program; Multi-stage attack; Multiple intensities; Negative side effects; Optimal investments; Pareto optimal solutions; Security controls; Integer programming"

The topic of delegation did not exist in classical computing security, but - as IT systems got more distributed and complex - provision for delegation became a necessary access-control feature, and consequently much effort has been dedicated to extend conventional access control models with delegation capability. Many such efforts have pivoted around the well-known Role-based Access Control (RBAC) model, mainly for compatibility reasons, as RBAC had already been considered the de facto industry standard - even before the need for delegation arose in enterprise information systems. However, delegation is arguably more discretionary in nature rather than role-based; especially for healthcare informatics which is the application domain for our proposed delegation framework. In this paper, we present a discretionary framework for delegation of access rights from a delegator to a delegatee by implementing a delegation-token and various stages of its life cycle in tamper-resistant devices including smartcards. The proposed framework is designed and implemented using our eTRON cybersecurity architecture which advocates use of public key cryptographic protocols for secure entity authentication, data integrity and data confidentiality. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Access control; Authentication; Cryptography; Delegation; Tamper-resistance","Authentication; Control systems; Cryptography; Distributed computer systems; Information science; Information systems; Life cycle; Network architecture; Smart cards; Cryptographic protocols; Delegation; Enterprise information system; Entity authentications; Health care informatics; Role-based access control model; Tamper resistance; Tamper-resistant devices; Access control"

In this research-in-progress, we propose a model for genomic cloud services that dynamically adapt to the diverse information security and information privacy requirements in genomic research.

Findings - The authors conclude that existing research has focused on a limited set of research topics. A majority of the research has focused management issues, while employees'/non-staffs' actual information security work in inter-organisational settings is an understudied area. In addition, the majority of the studies have used a subjective/argumentative method, and few studies combine theoretical work and empirical data.

Most conventional data encryption schemes are relatively complicated and complexity in encrypted keys is insufficient, resulting in long computational time and low degree of security against all types of attacks. Consequently, a highlysecured and robust data encryption scheme is necessary. This paper therefore presents the data encryption scheme based on a combination of Cellular Automata (CA) and a robust chaotic system that employs absolutevalue piecewise-linear nonlinearity. The proposed encryption scheme is not only applicable to image encryption but also extendable to text and Excel files. Simulation results reveal that the entropy of the encrypted image is nearly 8 corresponding to the image entropy theory, and the correlation coefficients of before-and-after encrypted images are close to zero. Besides, the histogram of the encrypted image of pixel values in the range (0-255) is apparently at, indicating that the color in image is fully distributed. Such results indicate that the proposed data encryption scheme offers a high level of security with fast processing time duration. The implementation of image encryption Android application is demonstrated.

Protection by purely technical means is hampered by this vulnerability window. During this window, users need to act to protect themselves. To support users in doing so, the paper aims to propose to first make users aware of the need to consult the address bar. Moreover, the authors propose to prune URL displayed in the address bar. The authors report on an evaluation of this proposal. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an online study with 411 participants, judging 16 websites - all with authentic design: half with legitimate and half with phish URLs. The authors applied four popular widely used types of URL manipulation techniques. The authors conducted a within-subject and between-subject study with participants randomly assigned to one of two groups (domain highlighting or pruning). The authors then tested both proposals using a repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance. Findings - The analysis shows a significant improvement in terms of phish detection after providing the hint to check the address bar. Furthermore, the analysis shows a significant improvement in terms of phish detection after the hint to check the address bar for uninitiated participants in the pruning group, as compared to those in the highlighting group. Research limitations/implications - Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications - Thispaperconfirms the efficacy of URL pruning and of prompting users to consult the address bar for phish detection. Originality/value - This paper introduces a classification for URL manipulation techniques used by phishers. We also provide evidence that drawing people's attention to the address bar makes them more likely to spot phish websites, but does not impair their ability to identify authentic websites. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Individual behaviour; Information security","Computer crime; Security of data; Websites; Design/methodology/approach; Individual behaviour; Manipulation techniques; Multivariate analysis of variances; Repeated measures; Research approach; Research results; Security threats; Multivariant analysis"

Such failures to comply may simply be innocent mistakes. However, there is evidence that, in some circumstances, users choose not to comply because they perceive that the security benefit of compliance is outweighed by the cost that is the impact of compliance on their abilities to complete their operational tasks. That is, they perceive security compliance as hindering their work. The ‘compliance budget’ is a concept in information security that describes how the users of an organization’s systems determine the extent to which they comply with the specified security policy. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a qualitative logical analysis of, and so provide reasoning tools for, this important concept in security economics for which quantitative analysis is difficult to establish.

Logs are usually intended for diagnostic and debugging purposes, but their data can be extremely useful in system audits and forensic investigations. Logs created by intrusion detection systems, web servers, anti-virus and anti-malware systems, firewalls and network devices have information that can reconstruct the activities of malware or a malicious agent, help plan for remediation and prevent attacks by revealing probes or intrusions before damage has been done. While existing tools like Splunk can help analyze logs with known schemas, understanding log whose format is unfamiliar or associated with new device or custom application can be challenging. We describe a framework for analyzing logs and automatically generating a semantic description of their schema and content in RDF. The framework begins by normalizing the log into columns and rows using regular expression-based and dictionary-based classifiers. Leveraging our existing work on inferring the semantics of tables, we associate semantic types with columns and, when possible, map them to concepts in general knowledge-bases (e.g. DBpedia) and domain specific ones (e.g., Unified Cybersecurity Ontology). We link cell values to known type instances (e.g., an IP address) and suggest relationships between columns. Converting large and verbose log files into such semantic representations reveals their meaning and supports search, integration and reasoning over the data. © 2016 IEEE.","Cybersecurity; Knowledge Graph; Linkeddata; Log Files","Application programs; Computer crime; Computer networks; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Damage detection; Integration; Intrusion detection; Knowledge management; Malware; Natural language processing systems; Program debugging; Program diagnostics; Semantic Web; Semantics; Cyber security; Forensic investigation; Intrusion Detection Systems; Knowledge graphs; Linkeddata; Log file; Semantic interpretation; Semantic representation; Information use"

The objectives of this study are to explore the shortfalls of information security on a South African financial institution and further investigate whether business processes are responsive to organization's needs. This study employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Questionnaires were sent to staff level employees, and semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with senior management at the organization. The study revealed that employees require training on information management and that there are major training deficiencies for training officers to conduct beneficial information management training at the organization. Information security program that include business risk analysis were not implemented, which results in inadequate information management planning and decisions. A standardized or uniform house rule policy was not consistently implemented across the organization, which resulted in certain areas not protecting information. The qualitative findings revealed that the external cleaning company could obtain access to customer information, if customer data are left lying around. Furthermore, there is major misalignment between policy setters and employees in this organization. The findings allow senior managers to construct projects and program with their teams to improve the state of information management in the organization which spans across the people aspect, technology systems and general information management processes. Furthermore, external companies should start signing Non-Disclosure Agreements - which is not being done currently as this opens the door for data fraud. The organization has information management and security policies in place, but the study concluded that employees do not understand these policies and should receive specialized training to ensure understanding and, ultimately, have employees following these information security policies. © Ridoh Adonis, Bethuel Sibongiseni Ngcamu, 2016.","Business processes; Data breach; Information legislation; Information management",""

The questionnaire items on the students’ perception were about the social networking sites (SNSs) usage and its positive and negative impacts. Among 432 medical students 312 (72.2%) students showed that social networking sites are the necessity of the everyday life [p=001]; helps in sharing the healthcare information 321 (74.3%) [p=0.001]; provide enough opportunities to promote academic medical activities 392 (90.7%) [p=0.02]; improve the quality of health care and communication 360 (83.3%) [p=0.01]; and SNSs is the fastest and easiest access for sharing and understanding the medical subject contents to promote activities among the fellow students 302 (69.9%) [p=0.001]. Medical students have a positive perception about the social networking websites and its role in medical professionalism. SNSs are being used extensively by the medical students to promote and enhance the knowledge. The most positive impact of SNSs was to facilitate the medical students to learn and understand the medical information; however, the study provides students’ concerns related to the shared information security. © 2016, Scientific Publishers of India.

While the technical community is working on improved system designs to prevent and mitigate such attacks, a significant residual risk remains that attacks succeed and may not even be detected, i.e., they are stealthy. Our objective is to inform security policy design for the mitigation of stealthy information leakage attacks. Such a policy mechanism advises system owners on the optimal timing to reset defense mechanisms, e.g., changing cryptographic keys or passwords, reinstalling systems, installing new patches, or reassigning security staff. We follow a game-theoretic approach and propose a model titled FlipLeakage. In our proposed model, an attacker will incrementally and stealthily take ownership of a resource (e.g., similar to advanced persistent threats). While her final objective is a complete compromise of the system, she may derive some utility during the preliminary phases of the attack. The defender can take a costly recovery move and has to decide on its optimal timing. Our focus is on the scenario when the defender can only partially eliminate the foothold of the attacker in the system. Further, the defender cannot undo any information leakage that has already taken place during an attack. We derive optimal strategies for the agents in FlipLeakage and present numerical analyses and graphical visualizations. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Access control; Decision theory; Cryptographic key; Defense mechanism; Graphical visualization; Information leakage; Multi-stage attack; Optimal strategies; Policy mechanisms; Technical community; Game theory"

Many state-of-the-art libraries (e.g., LIO, HLIO, and MAC) allow computations to manipulate data with different security labels by introducing the notion of labeled values, which protect values with explicit labels by means of an abstract data type. While computations have an underlying algebraic structure in such libraries (i.e. monads), there is no research on structures for labeled values and their impact on the programming model. In this paper, we add the functor structure to labeled values, which allows programmers to conveniently and securely perform computations without side-effects on such values, and an applicative operator, which extends this feature to work on multiple labeled values combined by a multi-parameter function. This functionality simplifies code, as it does not force programmers to spawn threads to manipulate sensitive data with side-effect free operations. Additionally, we present a relabel primitive which securely modifies the label of labeled values. This operation also helps to simplify code when aggregating data with heterogeneous labels, as it does not require spawning threads to do so. We provide mechanized proofs of the soundness our contributions for the security library MAC, although we remark that our ideas apply to LIO and HLIO as well. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Algebra; Flow control; Libraries; Security of data; Security systems; Algebraic structures; Flexible manipulations; Information flow control; Mechanized proofs; Multiparameters; Programming models; Security library; State of the art; Abstract data types"

The most prominent examples are Restricted Identification and Pseudonymous Signature schemes designed by the German Federal Office for Information Security for German personal identity cards. The main properties are that a user can authenticate himself with a single private key (stored on a smartcard), but nevertheless the user’s IDs in different systems are unlinkable. We develop a solution which enables a user to achieve the above mentioned goals while using more than one personal device, each holding a single secret key, but different for each device – as for security reasons no secret key is allowed to leave a secure device. Our solution is privacy preserving: it will remain hidden for the service system which device is used. Nevertheless, if a device gets stolen, lost or compromised, the user can revoke it (leaving his other devices intact). In particular, in this way we create a strong authentication framework for cloud users, where the cloud does not learn indirectly personal data. In the standard solutions there is no way to avoid leaking information that, for instance, the user is in his office and authenticates via his desktop computer. Our solution is based on a novel cryptographic primitive, called Pseudonymous Public Key Group Signature. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Group signature; Privacy; Pseudonyms; Signature schemes","Access control; Data privacy; Network security; Security of data; Smart cards; Anonymous authentication; Cryptographic primitives; Group signatures; Personal identity cards; Pseudonyms; Restricted identifications; Signature Scheme; Strong authentication; Authentication"

For example, according to Accenture surveys, the number of managers who consider sustainability to be critical to the future success of their organizations jumped from fifty to more than eighty percent from 2007 to 2010, fueling interest in a range of new sustainability initiatives.2 Similar trends may be seen with regard to cybersecurity,3 which is already prompting consideration of novel cybersecurity strategies aimed at translating this increased interest into action. One such avenue is corporate social responsibility (""CSR""). This Article argues that organizations should treat cybersecurity as a matter of CSR to safeguard their customers and the public, such as by securing critical infrastructure. It is in corporations' own long-Term self-interest (as well as that of national security) to take such a wider view of private-sector risk management practices so as to encompass less traditional factors akin to what companies have done with respect to sustainability. To that end, the analogy of sustainable development will be developed, focusing on the applicability of certain aspects of the green movement, such as integrated reporting and the common heritage of mankind concept, to help foster cyber peace.","",""

After formalized evaluation about entity achieved, certain algorithm would be used to get the trust and trust value of an entity to another one, and the research about the above trust value could be used to solve the issue of trust between cloud service user and cloud service supplier. Secondary, in order to settle the problem, e.g. the unreal and vicious entity which is trusted in the trust model, a trust management measure is formed based on curve fitting. The measure could help determine truth degree and accuracy degree of trust value after dynamic analysis and judgment and analyze the behavior intent of entity for the purpose to assure accuracy and stability of trust model. The simulation result shows that the evaluation result of the model is more close to real credibility and cloud service supplier, at the same time, could effective resist the attack from the vicious cloud service user, assure safety of cloud service environment and help improve cloud service quality. © 2016, UK Simulation Society.

It is common that many data hiding researchers consider improving and increasing many aspects such as capacity, stego file quality, or robustness. In this paper, we use an audio file as a cover and propose a reversible steganographic method that is modifying the sample values using modulus function in order to make the reminder of that particular value to be same as the secret bit that is needed to be embedded. In addition, we use a location map that locates these modified sample values. This is because in reversible data hiding it needs to exactly recover both the secret message and the original audio file from that stego file. The experimental results show that, this method (measured by correlation algorithm) is able to retrieve exactly the same secret message and audio file. Moreover, it has made a significant improvement in terms of the following: the capacity since each sample value is carrying a secret bit. The quality measured by peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), and Similarity Index Modulation (SIM). All of them have proven that the quality of the stego audio is relatively high.

Cybersecurity incidents are a subject to grow into more complex attacks with worse consequences than before. The use of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) in such critical systems causes specific risks for ensuring of safety, as the master-property of such kind of systems, and security as a subordinate property primarily to the NPP reactor trip systems (RTS). Cybersecurity assessment results of industrial I&Cs are mainly based on subjective assessment of the expert judgment and they do not take into account all features of propagating FPGA technology. Nowadays there is a big gap in understanding how to assess and assure the security of FPGA-based NPP I&Cs (FNI&Cs). Conformance of FNI&Cs to security requirements, their verification to high-level standards often is subjective and depends on particular expert. Regulatory and certification bodies, developers and end-users of FNI&Cs are missing the understandable methodology for security assurance of such kind of systems taking into account specific context of the operating environment which allows decreasing time-to-market and thus providing benefits for all interested parties. The paper describes cybersecurity assurance technique of multi-version FNI&Cs. Requirements profile is formulated using the best practices from the following international regulations. The goal of the paper is presentation of the case-based methodology and tool of FNI&Cs cybersecurity assurance based on international regulations.

Despite significant interest and investment in ISRM, its organizational practice still has deficiencies since it is not considered a standard management process of an organization and lacks evidence based decision making. Business analytics (BA) presents organizations with a unique opportunity to base their ISRM upon continuous monitoring and data analysis, thereby helping executives make timely, data driven security decisions in a proactive manner. In this research in progress paper, we utilize Resource-based Theory (RBT) to develop a research model that explains how interaction between the capabilities of security analytics and ISRM results in the development of an enhanced, high level analytics enabled ISRM. This in turn impacts overall security performance. We define the model based on an extensive analysis of the BA and ISRM literature.

The paper proposes that security compliance burnout and security engagement as the mediating factors between security compliance demands, organizational and personal resources and individual security compliance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a multi-case in-depth interview method to explore the relevance and significance of security demands, organizational resources and personal resources on security compliance at work. Seventeen participants in three organizations including a bank, a university and an oil distribution company in Vietnam were interviewed during a four-month period. Findings - The study identified three security demands, three security resources and two aspects of personal resources that influence security compliance. The study demonstrates that the security environment factors such as security demands and resources affected compliance burden and security engagement. Personal resources could play an integral role in moderating the impact of security environment on security compliance. Research limitations/implications - The findings presented are not generalizable to the wider population of end-users in Vietnam due to the small sample size used in the interviews. Further quantitative studies need to measure the extent of each predictor on security compliance.

The analysis of tendencies of information technologies development in the transport network was conducted. It was determined that the most effective approach is to create an information transport architecture, together with the quality management system of transport services. Automated workplace for specialists of rail transport with this approach is synergistically formed as a local information space and process automation as part of a single intelligent information transport space in accordance with the strategy of transport development, management and information technologies. This approach allows standardizing technological processes of traffic, identifying points of risk of occurrence of security threats and information loss, forming a dynamic information environment decision support. The main problems of the effective operation of intelligent transport systems in general and each automated sites are information security, reliability of information, the stability of data transmission systems, and qualification of the personnel. The basis for the formation of local computer workstations are optional models of technological processes, taking into account the large number of situations on the railway transport options. The paper presents an example of modeling operations and assessment of the costs of the working time of commodity cashier. An analysis found fotochronometry the most appropriate for the study, which serves as the basis for action photography worker per shift with simultaneous maintenance of chronometry observations lasting one or another of his actions. The mathematical apparatus of research, calculation and optimization of logical systems is a simulation pertaining to the theory of probability, mathematical statistics and represented in terms of queuing theory. The proposed changes to modernize the automated place for commercial cashier can be embedded in the enterprises of the railway of Kazakhstan. © 2016 Malybaev et al.","Automated workstation; Information security; Intelligent transport systems; Rail transport; Republic of Kazakhstan",""

We posit that at the same time, exactly those security measures may have a negative effect, if employees perceive them, for instance, as difficult to understand, time-consuming, or an invasion of their privacy. However, focusing on pure technostress, information systems (IS) research so far has neglected stress induced by means of information security, although, there is first insight on the relevance of security-related stress for IS management. Therefore, in this research-in-progress, we employ the person-environment (PE) fit model to build on as well as expand the existing IS stress literature. We thereby develop a first comprehensive framework of security-related stress, which considers non-technological aspects of security-related stress of employees' work, personal, and social environment. In doing so, we propose a multidimensional second-order construct and conceptualize how security-related stress affects employees' productivity directly and indirectly by promoting their perceived level of technostress. The results of our study should help IS management to anticipate and consider the downfalls of information security requirements when formulating companies' information security measurements, and thus limit the ""dark side"" of information security.","Behavioral information security; Productivity; Security-related stress; Technostress","Information systems; Personnel training; Productivity; Security of data; Behavioral information security; Information security requirements; Information-security measurement; Second-order constructs; Security education; Social environment; Technological aspects; Technostress; Information management"

These changes, called concept drifts, cause the performance of the learned model to degrade over time. As such it is essential to detect and adapt to changes in the data, for the model to be of any real use. While, model adaptation requires labeled data (for retraining), the detection process does not have to. Labeling data is time consuming and expensive; and if data changes are infrequent, most of the labeling effort, spent on verification, is wasted. In this paper, an ensemble based detection method is proposed, which tracks the number of samples in the critical disagreement regions of the ensemble, to detect concept drift from unlabeled data. The proposed algorithm, is-distribution and model independent, unsupervised and can be used in an online incremental fashion. Experimental analysis on 4 real world concept drift datasets shows that the proposed methodology gives high prediction performance, low false alarm rate and uses only 11.3% overall labeling, on average. © 2016 IEEE.","Change detection; Concept drift; Cybersecurity; Ensemble classification; Streaming data; Unlabeled","Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Change detection; Concept drifts; Cyber security; Ensemble classification; Streaming data; Unlabeled; Information use"

This paper presents a way to work with uncertain information processing project risk analysis with regard to its sustainability. Risk management is an important part of various disciplines, e.g. Project management, Crisis management, Change management, Information Security Management System, etc. Risk analysis is mostly based on expert estimates. However, this may be a problem with brand new tasks as identification of different threats and their numerical evaluations can be interpreted as a decision-making task which can be formalised as a decision tree. A decision-making task solution requires knowledge of all relevant input information items (III), such as probabilities, penalties and profits. If all those numerical values are known then the well-known methods of decision trees evaluations can be used. However, if complex project management problems are solved then a substantial set of relevant data items is missing or its accuracies are prohibitively low. The aim of this paper is to present easy approach how missing elements of the III set can be obtained and integrated into incomplete data sets. The paper contributes a common sense heuristics to obtain missing elements of the III set which can generate all numerical values, i.e. a problem under complete ignorance is solve, and a reconciliation mechanism based on linear programming which allows results of common sense heuristics simply integrate into incomplete data set, i.e. a problem under partial ignorance is solved. The results are therefore divided into two parts. In the first part solves a problem under total ignorance. The second part of the case study evaluates some unknown probabilities, therefore solves a problem under partial ignorance. Both tasks, i.e. partial and total ignorance are demonstrated using a quasi-realistic decision tree. The decision tree has one root node, 6 lotteries and 15 terminals; the total number of unknown probabilities is 21 under total ignorance and 18 probabilities are evaluated under partial ignorance.","Decision tree; Partial ignorance; Project risks; Reconciliation; Sustainability projects; Total ignorance",""

CyGraph adopts a unified graph-based cybersecurity model relevant to potential and actual cyberattacks, defenses, and mission impacts. It captures incremental attack vulnerability, security events, and mission dependencies within a network environment, builds a predictive model of possible attack paths and critical vulnerabilities, and correlates events to known vulnerability paths. It also includes dependencies among mission requirements and network assets, for analysis in the context of mission assurance. The resulting knowledge graph captures the complex relationships among entities in the cybersecurity domain. CyGraph brings together isolated data and events into an overall picture for decision support and situational awareness. It prioritizes exposed vulnerabilities, mapped to potential threats, in the context of mission-critical assets. In the face of actual attacks, it correlates intrusion alerts to known vulnerability paths and suggests best courses of action for responding to attacks. For postattack forensics, it shows vulnerable paths that may warrant deeper inspection. CyGraph also supports CyQL (CyGraph Query Language), a domain-specific query language for expressing graph patterns of interest, with interactive visualization of query results. To help manage visual complexity, CyGraph supports the separation of graph models into interdependent layers. For time-dependent graph models, it provides dynamic visualization of evolving graph state. CyGraph also integrates with third-party tools for visualizing graph state changes (e.g., driven by simulations). Furthermore, it has capabilities for synthesizing graph models with particular statistical properties. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cybersecurity modeling; Graph visualization; Mission assurance attack graphs; NoSQL graph databases; Situational awareness",""

This study attempts to elucidate the interrelationships among transformational leadership, IS effectiveness, and organizational strategies. The paper not only provides quantitative evidence to describe IS effectiveness but also offers theoretical insights to explain how an IS manager’s organizational strategies can improve the effectiveness of IS. We collected data from IS managers at many Korean organizations. Due to the modest sample size, the study does not aim to present a representative frame of organizational information security measures but rather to explore the relationships between the implementation and effectiveness of the measures, which should be independent of sample size. This study showed that the transformational leadership of IS managers can improve the IS effectiveness of an organizational strategy. The transformational leadership of IS managers thus plays an important role in maintaining organizational security. © Research India Publications.","Information security Effectiveness; IS manager; Organizational strategy; Strategic stance; The transformational leadership",""

In contrast to established approaches, hazards are treated as a control problem rather than a reliability problem. STPA-Sec extends this approach to also include security analysis. However, when we applied STPA-Sec to real world use cases for joint safety and security analysis, a Battery Management System for a hybrid vehicle, we observed several limitations of the security extension.

Through controlled experiments we propose to test the effects of these mechanisms on how individuals respond to an intellectual property infringement scenario and whether or not they commit a security policy violation. The studies employ conscious and subconscious primes and are tested under distinct conditions, namely when participants are being monitored and when having different sets of performance goals.

With the move into greater water depths, industry is drilling deeper wells, where operations can experience higher pressures, higher temperatures, and greater uncertainty. Remote monitoring of drilling operations could help operators and regulators enhance the safety of these operations. This study advises the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) on the application and use of remote real-time monitoring (RRTM) to improve management of the safety and environmental risks of offshore oil and gas operations. As a central part of the charge (see Box 1 -1 in Chapter 1), BSEE asked the committee to conduct a workshop that addressed the critical operations and parameters to be monitored in real time, the role RRTM could play in automation and predictive software and condition-based maintenance (CBM), and how RRTM could be leveraged by BSEE and incorporated into its regulatory framework. Drillers have monitored drilling operations offshore in real time for decades; more recently, a few operators have also transmitted some of these data onshore to improve efficiency and risk management. During its information gathering, the committee was told that RRTM's benefits include increased efficiency, decreased downtime and operational disruptions, reduced equipment damage, improved safety, and overall reduction in risk. Whereas RRTM can provide the rig with technical support and access to onshore expertise, during the committee's workshop the U.S. industry expressed a belief that responsibility and authority for operational decision making should remain offshore. Situational awareness on the offshore facility is important, and RRTM data do not always provide the necessary context. The use of RRTM is variable across the offshore oil and gas industry, and diverse RRTM technologies are available. No RRTM industry standard or standard practice exists, and the industry exhibits varying levels of maturity in its use of RRTM. Thus, a standard approach is not likely to work or to be needed for every company or every well. The committee views RRTM as a best available and safest technology (BAST), when such technologies are consistent with the principles of ALARP (as low as reasonably practicable). The director of BSEE estab-lishes BAST through a documented process, but determining RRTM as BAST in some contexts would not mandate its use across the board. The decision to use RRTM occurs when such technologies are available and economically feasible. BSEE could use existing regulatory requirements, such as the Application for Permit to Drill (APD) and the Safety and Environmental Management System (SEMS) plan, to advance appropriate use of RRTM. By encouraging offshore operators to address RRTM in their APD or SEMS plans, BSEE could allow operators to determine the circumstances under which RRTM should be used and challenge them to do so when BSEE believes that RRTM is necessary for managing risk. RRTM information-whether in real time or archived-could also benefit BSEE in its inspection activities and support inspectors' review of safety-related information before they visit offshore facilities. Preparation, prioritized by risk, could allow for more efficient scheduling and effective execution of BSEE inspections. The committee is not in a position to recommend or validate a definitive list of critical operations and parameters for RRTM. In the committee's judgment, a single standard list for all operations is not practical in view of the variability in operating conditions, geology, and scope and scale of facilities; the evolution of technology; consideration of human factors; and the incorporation of RRTM in a risk-based approach to regulating offshore operations. However, companies using RRTM appear to monitor some of the same critical operations and parameters (see Chapter 2). As sensor technology advances and the ability to transmit that data improves, issues with regard to the management of massive volumes of real-time data will grow. Likewise, as more RRTM of offshore operations is introduced, cybersecurity risks associated with the increased use of technology will rise. Control systems for critical rig-based equipment, not originally designed for connectivity to Internet-facing systems, are likely be at risk. RRTM could contribute to achieving a longer-term goal of offshore systems CBM. Blowout preventers (BOPs) provide a promising case. However, before CBM can go forward, BOP operational data and maintenance history will need to be collected and stored continually over the lifetime of the equipment to allow development of predictive models. Retroactive analysis of BOP performance data may not be adequate due to the complexity and variability of offshore operations and incomplete BOP maintenance history. The committee's consensus recommendations, which are listed below and elaborated in Chapter 4, provide guidance to BSEE and stakeholders in addressing the issues associated with the application of RRTM to offshore oil and gas operations. Recommendation 1. BSEE should pursue a more performance-based regulatory framework by focusing on a risk-based regime that allows industry to determine relevant uses of RRTM on the basis of assessed levels of risk and complexity. BSEE could assess decisions about the monitoring of well parameters or the application of RRTM through the review of a company's APD or SEMS plans and challenge the company to apply RRTM to manage the risk of complex operations. Recommendation 2. The committee views RRTM as BAST when justified by the risk of particular wells. BSEE should monitor the spectrum of RRTM technologies and best practices by using either an internal BSEE group, such as the agency's proposed Engineering Technology Assessment Center, or an external organization, such as the Ocean Energy Safety Institute. Recommendation 3. Consistent with recommendations of previous committees of the National Academies (NAE and NRC 2012; NAE and NRC 2013), BSEE should encourage involvement of all stakeholders in the development of risk-based goals and standards governing offshore oil and gas processes. Specifically, BSEE should work with the American Petroleum Institute (API), the International Association of Drilling Contractors, and other relevant stakeholders to form an API standing technical committee (as opposed to an ad hoc committee) that would establish minimum requirements for which critical operations (and parameters) are monitored and for which data are collected and monitored in real time. In addition, BSEE, along with this technical committee, should propose standards for communication protocols between onshore and offshore facilities when RRTM is used. Recommendation 4. BSEE should encourage API to work with original equipment manufacturers, drilling contractors, and industry trade associations to establish a BOP CBM pilot project, with the goal of an API publication.

The results reveal that higher education operates in an open environment that supports employee's participation for policy compliance.

The previous work in the area of health information security has largely focused on attacks on the wireless communication channel of medical devices, or on health data stored in online databases. In this paper, we pursue an entirely different angle to health information security, motivated by the insight that the human body itself is a rich source (acoustic, visual, and electromagnetic) of data. We propose a new class of information security attacks that exploit physiological information leakage, i.e., various forms of information that naturally leak from the human body, to compromise privacy. As an example, we demonstrate attacks that exploit acoustic leakage from the heart and lungs. The medical devices deployed within or on our bodies also add to natural sources of physiological information leakage, thereby increasing opportunities for attackers. Unlike previous attacks on medical devices, which target the wireless communication to/from them, we propose privacy attacks that exploit information leaked by the very operation of these devices. As an example, we demonstrate how the acoustic leakage from an insulin pump can reveal important information about its operation, such as the duration and dosage of insulin injection. Moreover, we show how an adversary can estimate blood pressure (BP) by capturing and processing the electromagnetic radiation of an ambulatory BP monitoring device. © 2013 IEEE.","Healthcare; information leakage; information security; medical devices; privacy","Biomedical equipment; Blood pressure; Data privacy; Electromagnetic waves; Health; Health care; Insulin; Medical computing; Physiology; Security of data; Wireless telecommunication systems; Health informations; Health-care system; Information leakage; Insulin injections; Medical Devices; Physiological informations; Wireless communication channels; Wireless communications; Medical information systems"

Cryptography is an integral part of modern world information security making the virtual world a safer place. Cryptography is a process of making information unintelligible to an unauthorized person. Hence, providing confidentiality to genuine users. There are various cryptographic algorithms that can be used. Ideally, a user needs a cryptographic algorithm which is of low cost and high performance. However, in reality such algorithm which is a one stop solution does not exist. There are several algorithms with a cost performance trade off. For example, a banking application requires utmost security at high cost and a gaming application sending player pattern for analytics does not bother much about security but needs to be fast and cost effective. Thus, amongst the cryptographic algorithms existing, we choose an algorithm which best fits the user requirements. In, this process of choosing cryptographic algorithms, a study of strengths, weakness, cost and performance of each algorithm will provide valuable insights.

Recent studies have consistently found that the announcements of information security breaches (ISBs) are negatively associated with the market values of the announcing firms during the days surrounding the breach announcements. Given the improvement in firms' information environments and the better protection for investors generated by cross-listing, does cross-listing help firms to reduce the negative impacts caused by their announcements of ISBs? This paper conducts an event study of 120 publicly traded firms (among which 25 cross-list and 95 do not), in order to explore the answer. The results indicate that the impact of ISB announcements on a firm's stock prices shows no difference between cross-listing firms and noncross-listing firms.

To enable location-based services, mobile users are required to report their location information to the LBS servers and receive answers of location-based queries. Location privacy leak happens when such servers are compromised, which has been a primary concern for information security. To address this issue, we propose the Location Privacy Preservation Scheme (LPPS) based on distributed cache pushing. Unlike existing solutions, LPPS deploys distributed cache proxies to cover users mostly visited locations and proactively push cache content to mobile users, which can reduce the risk of leaking users' location information. The proposed LPPS includes three major process. First, we propose an algorithm to find the optimal deployment of proxies to cover popular locations. Second, we present cache strategies for location-based queries based on the Markov chain model and propose update and replacement strategies for cache content maintenance.

Unfortunately, these processes often offer only little or no support in order to meet security requirements. In our work, we propose a methodology to build domain specific process models with security concepts on the foundations of industry-relevant security approaches, backed by a security-oriented process model specification language. Instead of building domain specific security-oriented process models from the ground, the methodology allows process designers to fall back on existing well established security approaches and add domain relevant concepts and repository-centric approaches, as well as supplementary information security risk management standards (e.g., Common Criteria), to fulfill the demand for secure software engineering. Supplementary and/or domain specific concepts can be added trough our process modeling language in an easy and direct way. The methodology and the process modeling language we propose have been successfully evaluated by the TERESA project for specifying development processes for trusted applications and integrating security concepts into existing process models used in the railway domain. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","MDE toolchain; Model-Driven Engineering; Process modeling; Repository; Reuse; Secure software engineering","Computer software reusability; Mobile telecommunication systems; Process engineering; Risk management; Security of data; Software engineering; Specification languages; Standards; MDE toolchain; Model-driven Engineering; Process Modeling; Repository; Reuse; Secure software engineering; Modeling languages"

To investigate the similarities and differences between the two groups, we employed ethnography and trace ethnography to identify and compare each group's beliefs and concerns. Findings demonstrate significant differences in how IT and Non-IT professionals think about, and communicate cyber security. These differences in cyber security suggests a mismatch about how IT and Non-IT think and talk about cyber-security. This mismatch has consequences for the education of Non-IT professionals. Because each is concerned about different issues, when IT tries to educate Non-IT about cyber-threats, they may be talking past each other. As a result, the cyberawareness information does not necessarily prompt action by Non-IT professionals.","Community of practice; Cybersecurity; Ethnography; Networks of practice; Trace ethnography","Information systems; Knowledge acquisition; Community of practice; Cyber security; Ethnography; Networks of practices; Trace ethnography; Network security"

Some of these attacks have characteristics of intelligence and can be modelled as a set of collaborating software components such as those used in intelligent agents. In this paper, we discuss a set of parameters useful for analyzing and characterizing potential advanced cyber threats and for helping cybersecurity experts prepare to defend against them. A set of intelligent agents can be designed to collaborate in order to solve a complex problem, each agent having its own set of knowledge and expertise and being able to respond to requests from other agents for help in solving the problem. An intelligent agent can contain or have access to knowledge about context (e.g. patterns of network traffic) or problem-solving and can use any of the artificial intelligence reasoning techniques that are available to larger, more comprehensive software modules. Some agents are mobile, that is they can move across a network to operate on multiple network nodes. These intelligent agent paradigms can represent advanced threats. For example, intelligent agents as individual intelligent software entities, as a collaborating set, or as a swarm with emergent intelligence could be used to model threats which manifest cyber tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). This paper includes an analysis of the design parameters of intelligent agent architectures and the implications of these parameter choices for agent behaviors that can be used for analyzing and testing systems for the purpose of learning to secure them against sophisticated cyber-attacks. In order to motivate and support this analysis we provide a scenario use case which envisions the use of advanced intelligent agent teams for analysis of possible threats and for cybersecurity testing. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Cyber security; Intelligent agents; Models","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Computer crime; Crime; Human engineering; Malware; Mobile agents; Models; Network security; Problem solving; Software agents; Collaborating software; Cyber security; Design parameters; Intelligent agent architecture; Intelligent software; Multiple components; Multiple networks; Reasoning techniques; Intelligent agents"

Due to the uneven development, there might be vehicles of different intelligence levels co-existing and influencing each other, which, together with the complexity of existing human, vehicle, and road factors, may cause even more complex traffic accident forms. New traffic phenomena in future, such as the coexistence of various self-driving vehicles and human-driving vehicles, switching between human-driving and self-driving, information security of intelligent transportation systems, and environmental interference and adverse weather factors, may cause accidents.

To solve this problem, a new letter based VC which used additive based secret sharing. The proposed letter based VC method is independent on morphological features of letters and this method can be used all of the letters.

The traditional passive defence strategy has been unable to meet the demand of network information security. How to effectively detect and prevent the network intrusion have become an important matter in the field of computer security. The efficient intrusion detection system can reduce the false positive rate of the system, and improve the classification accuracy. This paper firstly introduces the intrusion detection system and detection data set. On this basis, this paper proposes an intrusion detection method based on improved PSO-SVM. The support vector machine can ensure that classifier has high classification accuracies. Secondly, we use PSO method to determine the important parameters of the SVM algorithm, such as the RBF kernel parameter, penalty parameter and insensitive loss error. Then, the improved PSO method can find the optimal value of the SVM. At this time, the error sum of squares of the SVM model has a minimum value, and the model has a fast convergence speed. Finally, because the training data sets of DoS and Probe are accounted for a larger proportion of all attacks, we use the IPSO-SVM classification algorithm for them, and have a test to the intrusion detection. The experimental results show that the overall performance of the proposed detection algorithm is very high. It has a strong ability to identify the characteristics of intrusion, and can provide the intrusion detection services for virtual environment.

The model highlights the importance of game-over components - critical system components which if acquired will give an adversary the ability to defeat a system completely. The model is based on systems that use defense-in-depth/layered-security approaches, as many systems do. In the model we define the concept of penetration cost, which is the cost that must be paid in order to break into the next layer of security. Second, we define natural decision and optimization problems based on cyber-security attacks in terms of doubly weighted trees, and analyze their complexity. More precisely, given a tree T rooted at a vertex r, a penetrating cost edge function c on T, a target-acquisition vertex function p on T, the attacker's budget and the game-over threshold B,G ∈ ℚ+ respectively, we consider the problem of determining the existence of a rooted subtree T′ of T within the attacker's budget (that is, the sum of the costs of the edges in T′ is less than or equal to B) with total acquisition value more than the game-over threshold (that is, the sum of the target values of the nodes in T′ is greater than or equal to G). We prove that the general version of this problem is intractable, but does admit a polynomial time approximation scheme. We also analyze the complexity of three restricted versions of the problems, where the penetration cost is the constant function, integer-valued, and rational-valued among a given fixed number of distinct values. Using recursion and dynamic-programming techniques, we show that for constant penetration costs an optimal cyber-attack strategy can be found in polynomial time, and for integer-valued and rational-valued penetration costs optimal cyber-attack strategies can be found in pseudo-polynomial time. Third, we provide a list of open problems relating to the architectural design of cyber-security systems and to the model.","Complexity; Cyber security; Defense-in-depth; Game over; Information security; Layered security; Polynomial time; Pseudo-polynomial time; Weighted rooted trees","Budget control; Costs; Crime; Dynamic programming; Integer programming; Network security; Polynomial approximation; Rational functions; Security of data; Security systems; Complexity; Cyber security; Defense in depth; Game over; Layered security; Polynomial-time; Rooted trees; Computer crime"

It is possible to automatically extract the security relevant information from these statements with parsing XML tags through the use of scripts that extract text based on specific delimiters occurring in text; however, this solution is difficult, inefficient, and error-prone. XBRL provides a structure based on XML for extraction of this data, however, there are gaps in the XBRL nomenclature that necessitates the use of scripting for pulling the non-XBRL components. The extensive written portions of the annual disclosure statements where the security related information is present (based on SEC guidance) tends to be poorly described in terms of tag set deployment. The extension to XBRL proposed in this paper will help gather security information from SEC reports more robustly and accurately.

Outbound spam can reflect the information security level of an organization as most spam emails are generated by compromised computers. Understanding the trend of outbound spam can help organizations adopt proactive policies and measures toward a more informed decision on resource allocation in terms of security investment. This can also facilitate governments in designing incentive mechanisms such as cyber insurance. Using three years of daily spam volume from the United States, this research investigates the distribution of daily volume and compare univariate time series methods for forecasting. The methods explored include various exponential smoothing methods, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and neutral network auto-regressive (NNAR) modeling. Our evaluation of multiple univariate time series models suggests that Holt's linear trend models based on exponential smoothing and neural network modeling can lead to more accurate spam prediction. The conclusion and implications are discussed.","Forecasting; Spam; Time series; United States","Economics; Forecasting; Information systems; Internet; Security of data; Signal encoding; Time series; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Exponential smoothing; Exponential smoothing method; Policies and measures; Spam; United States; Univariate time series; Univariate time series models; Time series analysis"

Healthcare workers are able to reach previously disconnected communities and homesteads to deliver health related services through the use of custom mobile computing devices or applications that facilitate the viewing, recording and updating of patient records. Notably, the presence of electronic patient information presents privacy and confidentiality challenges that if not addressed, may affect the delivery of health services thereby negatively impacting on the overall health outcomes of the communities. Deficit based solutions target the needs and challenges of the communities in developing solutions and have been widely used; however, little emphasis has been placed on utilizing the existing asset resources that contribute positively to the overall health outcomes in the development of solutions. This paper leverages off an asset model developed by Morgan and Ziglio to identify existing community assets in a rural community through the use of a survey issued to community health workers and the supporting IT staff. The results point to assets in the cohesive social structures centered on the trust bond between the patients and the providers. Moreover, mentoring support structures and periodic training activities keep the health worker skills up to date. Furthermore, a positive appreciation of health information sensitivity and the need for patient privacy and confidentiality provide for productive interactions between health workers and patients. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.","Health assets; Information security; Rural health","Mobile computing; Public health; Security of data; Ubiquitous computing; Community Health Workers; Developing solutions; Health informations; Mobile computing devices; Patient information; Rural health; Support structures; Training activities; Medical computing"

The contribution of this paper is to reduce the cost of communication of the datagram transport layer security protocol DTLS and to improve the weakness of the cookies exchange in the handshake process against deny of service attacks. The proposed enhanced cryptography protocol is integrated into the constrained application protocol to reduce the cost in terms of messages and size taken by the security layer in each message. The evaluation of the proposed protocol is performed on the Contiki operating system, for the internet of things, and compared with the original version of the DTLS protocol.

Therefore, defensive actions are readily available once an outside threat is identified (Colwill in Human factors in information security: the insider threat—who can you trust these days? pp. 186–196, 2009 [1]). Contradictory to the ideas of social identification as an “us” and “them,” the greatest enemy may be lurking within one’s own organization. Individuals are considered insiders if they presently have (or at one time had) permission to access an organization’s data or network structures (Greitzer et al. in Secur Priv IEEE 6(1):61–64, 2008 [2]). The concept of the insider threat is considered one of the most difficult situations to deal with in the cybersecurity domain (Hunker and Probst in J Wireless Mobile Netw Ubiquitous Comput Dependable Appl 2(1):4–27, 2011 [3]). The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners has reported two-thirds of fraud and identity thefts are executed by organizations’ employees or other known insiders. They also estimate U.S. companies have lost 5% of revenue to fraudulent insider activities (Randazzo et al. in Insider threat study: illicit cyber activity in the banking and finance sector, 2005 [4]). Insiders have multiple advantages over an outsider. An insider threat is one of the most difficult situations to identify. Therefore, it is critical that training be developed. The first step to effective training is constructing an environment that lends itself to insider threat situations. The present paper describes the process in which one insider threat virtual environment was constructed. A discussion of the considerations and functional features is detailed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Cybersecurity; Game engines; Gaming environment; Insider threat","Crime; Security of data; Virtual reality; Banking and finance; Cyber security; Functional features; Game Engine; Gaming environment; Identity theft; Insider Threat; Social identification; Human engineering"

In the automotive domain the increasing complexity of systems became challenging with consumer demands for advanced driving assistance systems and automated driving functionalities, and the thus broadening societal sensitivity for security and safety concerns, such as remote control of cars by hacking their IT infrastructure. As vehicle providers gear up for the cyber-security challenges, they can leverage experiences from many other domains, but nevertheless have to face several unique challenges. The recently released SAE J3061 guidebook for cyber-physical vehicle systems provides high-level principles for automotive organizations to identify and assess cyber-security threats and design cyber-security aware systems in close relation to ISO 26262. Although functional safety and cyber-security engineering have a considerable overlap regarding many facets, such as analysis methods and system function thinking, the definition of system borders (item definition vs. trust boundaries) often differs largely. Therefore, appropriate systematic approaches to support the identification of trust boundaries and attack vectors for the safety- and cybersecurity-relates aspects of complex automotive systems are essential. In the course of this paper, we analyze a method to identify attack vectors on complex systems via signal interfaces. We focus on a central development artifact of the ISO 26262 functional safety development process, the hardware-software interface (HSI), and propose an extension for the HSI to support the cyber-security engineering process. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Automotive systems; Cyber-security; Functional safety; Hardwaresoftware interfaces; ISO 26262; SAE J3061","Automotive industry; Hardware; Hardware security; Personal computing; Process engineering; Reconfigurable hardware; Remote control; Safety engineering; Security systems; Automotive Systems; Cyber security; Functional Safety; ISO 26262; SAE J3061; Advanced driver assistance systems"

Using a ranking-Delphi method, we quantify information security expert opinion regarding what sort of scenarios are most likely to disrupt one's desire (attitude) and intention to comply with information security policy. While our panel did not reach consensus on which scenarios may be most likely to interrupt security compliance, their experience and insight has reinforced the notion that behavioral intention is not an absolute predictor of actual behavior. As such IS security research should not culminate in evaluating impact to behavioral intention, but should instead attempt to understand a phenomena's correlation to actual behavior whenever possible.","Behavioral intention; Compliance; IS security","Information systems; Security of data; Behavioral intention; Compliance; Information security policies; IS security policies; Security compliance; Security experts; Security policy; Security research; Security systems"

Security education training and awareness (SETA) programs are used by organizations as a proactive mechanism to ensure employees fully understand potential threats to organizational data and the appropriate countermeasures available to them. Motivational research may highlight interesting ways in which the effectiveness of SETA programs can be improved.

This article aims to provide evidence on the determinants of telemedicine use in clinical practice. Methods: The survey targeted a total population of 398 medical professionals from a healthcare institution in Spain. The study sample was formed by the ninety-three primary care physicians who responded. Using an extended Technology Acceptance Model and microdata for the ninety-six physicians, binary logistic regression analysis was carried out. Results: The analysis performed confirmed the model's goodness-of-fit, which allowed 48.1 percent of the dependent variable's variance to be explained. The outcomes revealed that the physicians at the healthcare institution placed greater importance on telemedicine's potential to reduce costs, and on its usefulness to the medical profession. The perception of medical information security and confidentiality and the patients' predisposition toward telemedicine were the second explanatory factors in order of importance. A third set of moderating effects would appear to corroborate the importance of the physicians' own opinions. Conclusions: These results have revealed the need for a dynamic approach to the design of telemedicine use, especially when it targets a variety of end-users. Hence, the importance of conducting studies before using telemedicine, and attempting to identify which of the above-mentioned predictors exert an influence and how. © Cambridge University Press 2016.","Intention to use; Perceived attitudes; Probabilistic models of causation; Technology acceptance model (TAM); Technology drivers; Telemedicine adoption","Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Physicians, Primary Care; Regression Analysis; Spain; Telemedicine; User-Computer Interface; Health care; Regression analysis; Security of data; Intention to use; Perceived attitudes; Probabilistic models; Technology acceptance model; Technology drivers; adoption; confidentiality; dependent variable; driver; general practitioner; human; human experiment; logistic regression analysis; medical information; medical profession; perception; Spain; telemedicine; adult; behavior; computer interface; computer security; cost benefit analysis; economics; female; general practitioner; health personnel attitude; male; middle aged; psychological model; psychology; regression analysis; telemedicine; utilization; Telemedicine"

As well, with the growing reliance on networked devices and systems for daily operations, it is natural that identifying and responding to cyber attacks is a critical piece in enterprise level operations. In order to minimize operational impact, cyber security is typically tackled from two directions. Shrinking cyber gaps and increasing breach preparedness. However, typical defense technologies such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) systems create 10's of thousands of alarms in minutes, thus creating a new problem. With so many events being logged, detected threats to critical systems can easily be hidden and lost. As well, mining through hundreds of thousands of security logs require long lead times and analysts with extensive knowledge of monitored systems, network topology, and networking protocols in order to accurately identify cyber threats. In this paper we propose, a new cyber analyst tool, Cyber Impact Assessment (CyberIA), to facilitate the processing of IDS logs to quickly determine the impact due to cyber events. The CyberIA system is a data-driven intrusion detection log analysis tool capable of processing tens of thousands of alarms. The system is comprised of two phases. The first phase clusters alarms using the k-means algorithm on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for improved performance. The second phase consists of a supervised machine learning support vector machine (SVM) algorithm which is used to reduce the number of logs presented to analysts. Timing analysis of the k-means clustering algorithm will be conducted on data from DARPA's 1999 intrusion detection dataset. The sequential k-means algorithm will be compared with the GPU counterpart to assess the practical speed up of the first phase algorithm in the CyberIA framework. The beauty of the CyberIA system is that it is a web based framework allowing for quick integration to other data sources and data processing libraries. With the performance increase, the final CyberIA system will process IDS logs, organize them based on impact to security posture, display the information, and ultimately allow analysts to quickly interpret groups of events rather than individual alerts.","Clustering; Cyber security; GPGPU; Intrusion detection system; Log minimization; Machine learning","Clustering algorithms; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Computer viruses; Crime; Graphics processing unit; Information management; Intrusion detection; Network security; Pattern matching; Program processors; Support vector machines; Viruses; Assessment system; Clusterings; Cyber security; GPGPU; Impact assessments; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Log minimization; Machine-learning; Minimisation; Cybersecurity"

These are consistent with their other provocations such as their nuclear weapons programs and aggressive activities along the border. The damage of these attacks is increasing, and they are a significant annoyance that is preventing progress on resolving the conflict between the two states. This paper will first survey the dramatic differences between North Korea and South Korea in cyberspace, and summarize the continuing evolution of North Korean cyberattacks. Attribution of most attacks to North Korea is not difficult because many of the same methods are used repeatedly, and many of the attacks are timed to coincide with important anniversaries. Thus, unlike with cybercriminals, these cyberattacks can often be predicted and recognized, and preparations can be made for them. North Korean cyberattacks often violate international law since they indiscriminately target civilians since the state considers itself not subject to international law. Nonetheless, there are many things South Korea can do to respond. International law can be invoked even without cooperation by the parties, and sanctions can be imposed. Defenses can be strengthened by better coordination of defenses between the private and governmental sectors through a unified early-warning defense. Repeated cyberattacks also justify a counterattack according to international law. North Korea has a limited set of state-mandated software on a small set of networks, and this makes widespread effects of cyberattacks on them quite possible. The main difficulty is getting access to these networks, but there are ways, especially given the growing use of smartphones in North Korea. As for attack goals, what North Korea fears the most is information about the rest of the world getting to their citizens, so sending accurate such information should be a major goal of cybercounterattacks - data destruction is unnecessary.","Attribution; Cyberattacks; Defense; International law; North Korea; Offense; Response","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; International cooperation; Nuclear weapons; Attribution; Cyber-attacks; Cyberspaces; Defense; North Korea; North Korean; Offense; Response; South Korea; Two-state; Network security"

We track and solve Resilience, Security and Usability issues jointly in Enterprise IS. This challenge requires considering the ergonomics of interactions, effectiveness and efficiency of the task realization, user satisfaction, and trust as well as human feelings when using the secure services. In this paper, we propose an approach based on paradigms of socio-technical systems to model the interplay between resilience, security and usability.

Herein, we deposited small magnetic nickel ferrite nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets uniformly (NiFe2O4/r-GO) using a facile one-pot hydrothermal method with free of chemical agents, and investigated their permittivity, permeability and microwave absorption. Notably, we find an effective strategy for tuning microwave attenuation by the synergistic effect of dielectric and magnetic loss, which originates from inducing multiple relaxations and multiple resonances. The best impedance matching of NiFe2O4/r-GO was sought out. The minimum reflection loss (RL) can reach -42 dB with a broad bandwidth (RL ≤ -10 dB) of 5.3 GHz. Meanwhile, the multiple regions endow the absorbers with selectivity for efficient absorption.

Both are human-related. The former was traced to flaws caused by human interventions in development. In the latter case, humans also intervene to connect the dots, find meaningful patterns, and make sense of the information. The proposed solutions are based on more human interventions, which tend to aggravate the problems rather than solving them. I propose the complete elimination of human interventions in both cases. This goal is conceptually easy to achieve. The approach, however, is radical and theoretical. It considers the causal set, a mathematical object, as the universal language underlying all information in nature and, hence, also all computation. This assumption is recognized as the fundamental principle of causality, that effects follow their causes. The new theory is based solely on the causal set, its metric, and its vast array of algebraic properties. The consequences are unexpected, fascinating, and totally new. Since translations between causal sets and programming languages are easy, I also propose to confine the use of programming languages to the human interface, and create an inner layer of mathematical code expressed as a causal set.

For business applications ever more sophisticated mobile devices, such as notebooks and smartphones, offer the opportunity to work outside the office in almost the same manner as on the business premises of an organization. But this advantages of accessing sensitive data without restriction of the location involves severe information security risks. Hence, information exposure, which is in the focus of data leakage prevention (DLP) and information leakage prevention (ILP), is a decisive key factor. Current state of the art enterprise content-aware DLP solutions offer different approaches to monitor and to protect confidential data at client endpoints. However, these DLP solutions are restricted to prevent technologically based data breaches and they are subject to several issues and limitations. One of these issues is the reliance on a single successful authentication of an authorized user. Therefore, this work introduces a novel concept for enhancing DLP on client endpoints by establishing continuous supervision for verifying the identity and the attendance of the user as well as for enhancing the privacy by preventing shoulder surfing. This concept is bases on mobile sensor technology and biometric methods which are used by state of the art mobile devices for security features as well as for smart features. In this context, a common DLP approach is combined with continuous supervision by utilizing the front camera of the mobile device. In order to prove the concept, this work presents a web technology based prototype which allows a wide range of application. In general, the implementation targets a high used user acceptance which is influenced by the performance efficiency as well as the detection reliability. Therefore, these benchmark figures are evaluated for various JavaScript libraries processed on mobile devices with different hardware specifications. The presented and discussed results indicate the technical feasibility of this concept. However, there are certain requirements with respect to the hardware specification of the mobile devices.","Biometrics; Continuous supervision; Information and data leakage prevention; Information and data security; Information exposure","Mobile computing; Mobile security; Sensitive data; Specifications; Continuous supervision; Data and information; Data leakage preventions; Hardware specifications; Information and data leakage prevention; Information exposure; Information leakage; Modern technologies; Novel concept; State of the art; Biometrics"

DRO uses advances in data security to enable distributed data management techniques like: local secure caching of data for retrieval and search, localized network reconstitution in the face of successful DDoS or cyber attacks, and advanced data search and request capabilities for advanced user capabilities. Today existing systems like Internet Relay Chat (IRC) provide multicast-like service using hub and spoke architectures and multiple, frequently unprotected, pairwise connections. This results in a network that provides DDoS attack vectors via network sniffing, message retransmission, and control message spoofing. Furthermore, due to security considerations all retransmissions must originate from the original data source. This makes reconstitution of operational networks highly inefficient in terms of system bandwidth and management of pairwise interconnections. DRO integrates emerging technologies in a synergistic manner to create capabilities that exceed the current distributed data management systems. DRO has 5 areas of technical innovation. DDoS Resistant Multicast (DRM) automatically identifies and filters messages that are out of sync with network management. It binds the multicast address to a group cryptographic key enables the address to inherit several desirable characteristics of the underlying key - controlled frequent updates, rollover capabilities, group topologic manipulation, group membership control, secure command and control, and cryptographic level entropy. Delay Tolerant Multicast allows operation during attacks. Using the object structure of the DTN Bundle Security Protocol with the DRO data distribution architecture facilitates delay tolerant multicast data delivery without the overhead of the DTN communication protocols. Multiple partition secure objects allow the network to securely cache, search and retransmit DRO objects. The object security key management is divorced from session security enabling long lifetime object structures that embrace attribute based access control key management that permits late binding of destination and late admittance to access groups. Distributed caching and retransmission allows reconstitution of network operation using localized resources. The DRO architecture incorporates caching and retransmission service at network and application layers. This facilitates network reconstruction and resiliency using local resources. Data searches are enabled by the encrypted metadata payloads enabling, intra-object referencing and management. Decentralized data searching that preserves security of the critical information provides a new paradigm for secure management of mobile information.","Cryptographically protected networking; Distributed denial of service attacks; Key management; Secure multicasting","Access control; Cryptography; Cybersecurity; Delay tolerant networks; Information management; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multicasting; Network architecture; Network layers; Network management; Network security; Relay control systems; Search engines; Cryptographically protected networking; DDoS Attack; Denialof- service attacks; Distributed data managements; Distributed denial of service; Distributed denial of service attack; Key-management; Localised; Retransmissions; Secure multicasting; Denial-of-service attack"

They are defining what they mean by cyber security in their national strategy documents. The common theme from all of these varying definitions, however, is that cyber security is fundamental to both protecting government secrets and enabling national defense, in addition to protecting the critical infrastructure that permeate and drive the 21st century global economy. The development of cyber security capabilities is a complex matter. Whether at the nation state level, or in an enterprise, various factors need to be taken into consideration. A layered approach can provide more comprehensive coverage than single, disparate solutions. The measurements of security postures and progress over time are important elements to strengthening policies, evaluating risks and anticipating future scenarios. Different cybersecurity indices have been published in the past few years, yet not all measure the same capabilities. According to International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Cyber security is not an end unto itself; cyber security must be understood as a means to an end. The goal should be to build confidence and trust that critical information infrastructure would work reliably and continue to support national interests even when under attack. Therefore the focus of national cyber security strategies should be on the threats most likely to disrupt vital functions of society. Digitalization and information societies are ever evolving and new cyber threats continue to be devised. In this progress, cyber security must form an integral and indivisible part of the nation's security process. Countries need to be aware of their current capability level in cyber security and at the same time identify areas where cybersecurity needs to be enhanced. It can be said that cyber security is a constant ""arms race"" between countries, but also between the security community and the hostile hackers. Today's high-profile cybersecurity incidents have underlined the crucial importance of strengthening cyber resilience in general, as well as the protection of critical infrastructure from cyber threats in all countries. In order to achieve these goals, public and private stakeholders need to be equipped with the capacity to effectively prevent, mitigate and respond to cyber-attacks and incidents. Resilience stands for the continuation of operations even when society faces a severe disturbance in its security environment, the capability to recover quickly from the shock, and the ability to either remount the temporarily halted functions or re-engineer them. How should one measure the maturity of national cyber security? Agreed international standards which can measure the level of national cyber capability, are not available. While nations are developing the cyber capabilities to operate in the cyber realm, measuring national cyber capabilities remains problematic. However, several different organizations have made their own analyses of the national cyber security capabilities, but especially measuring military cyber capabilities is challenging because of information classification. Countries prefer to be secretive about their military cyber capabilities. Another challenge in measuring national cyber capabilities relates to the ubiquity and dual-use nature of computing and cyber tools, the stealth and immediacy of cyber operations and uncertainty over the responsibilities of civilian and military organizations (International Institute for Strategic Studies 2014). In this paper we use DOTMLPF-II as a research framework. We analyze the cyber security capability using the DOTMLPF-II components: Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, Interoperability and Information. DOTMLPF-II analysis is the first step in building the national cyber security capability building. It determines necessary recommendations which are required to fill a capability gap identified in the analysis. As empirical material we use the reports and studies of European Union, BSA Software Alliance, Global Cybersecurity Index of the International Telecommunication Union and ABI Research, and Microsoft Intelligence report. On the basis of DOTMLPF-II cyber security capability modelling we analyze the national cyber security capability in Finland based on the reports mentioned above.","Capability; Cyber security; DOTMLPF-II","Critical infrastructures; National security; Network security; Personal computing; Public works; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Capability; Cyber security; Cyber threats; DOTMLPF-II; Finland; Global economies; International telecommunications unions; National defence; National strategies; Security capability; Cybersecurity"

To supply guidance for researchers from a comprehensive perspective, this paper, for the first time, reviews CS in information security field from two aspects: theoretical security and application security. Moreover, the CS applied in image cipher is one of the most widespread applications, as its characteristics of dimensional reduction and random projection can be utilized and integrated into image cryptosystems, which can achieve simultaneous compression and encryption of an image or multiple images. With respect to this application, the basic framework designs and the corresponding analyses are investigated. Specifically, the investigation proceeds from three aspects, namely, image ciphers based on chaos and CS, image ciphers based on optics and CS, and image ciphers based on chaos, optics, and CS. A total of six frameworks are put forward. Meanwhile, their analyses in terms of security, advantages, disadvantages, and so on are presented. At last, we attempt to indicate some other possible application research topics in future. © 2013 IEEE.","application security; chaos; Compressive sensing; image cipher; optics; theoretical security","Chaos theory; Cryptography; Optics; Security of data; Signal reconstruction; Application research; Application security; Compressive sensing; Dimensional reduction; Framework designs; image cipher; Random projections; theoretical security; Compressed sensing"

The term refers to a ""situation in which attempts to solve a problem are piecemeal or superficial, resulting only in temporary or minor improvement"" (Oxford English Dictionary). In many cases, information security professionals engage in seemingly endless tactical efforts to: 1) fix software weaknesses that may be subject to cyber exploitation; 2) monitor all network traffic at the packet-level for evidence of malware code; and 3) apply a growing number of security controls and tools to all the computational components of their system. As an example of the latter, the current list of controls published by the U.S. National Institute of Standards has grown to about one thousand. This paper will argue for adopting a more strategic approach to cybersecurity, and will use examples drawn from both historical and modern writings on military strategy to buttress its position. Historical sources will include von Clausewitz (On War, ca 1831) and Condell and Zabecki's (2001) translation of Truppenführing. Also included is a brief mention of the ideas of U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd, who is best known for crafting the Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act (OODA) loop that has been applied to business as well as military strategy. The OODA loop provided a starting point for a set of strategic cyber security elements that include: build layers of defense, enhance situational awareness of defensive status, manage settings and software, and build operational teamwork and morale. The concept of time provided an overarching principle for tying these different elements together. The goal of this article is to create a strategic model for cyber security that is based on enduring principles and described by a simple unifying concept. It is anticipated that this model will be improved over time and extended to specialized areas as needed. An example of an element in the current framework that will need to be improved became evident following comparisons against the strategic principles handed down by von Clausewitz, in particular.","Defensive principles; Military strategy; Situational awareness; Strategic cybersecurity","Malware; Network security; 'current; Case informations; Current practices; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Defensive principle; Information security professionals; Military strategy; Situational awareness; Strategic cybersecurity; Cybersecurity"

Repeated classification in control and monitoring systems is complicated by nonzero mistakes of traditional statistical decisions. At repeated applications of rules of statistical classification small probabilities of mistakes generate a large number of wrong decisions. At construction of monitoring systems of information security in computer systems wrong decisions are especially dangerous. Therefore for construction of secure architecture of control and monitoring systems it is necessary to look for nonconventional statistical decisions. In finite set of words of finite length the ban is the word having zero probability of appearance. If the statistical criterion has the critical set consisting of only bans of supposed probability measure, the probability of wrong rejection of this measure is equal to zero. Therefore repeated application of such criterion won't generate to false alarms in monitoring systems. In the paper we consider a case of statistical classification when classes are defined by finite sets of probability distributions on a space of infinite sequences. We use bans to define decision functions and prove conditions when these decisions produce no mistakes. © ECMS Thorsten Claus, Frank Herrmann, Michael Manitz, Oliver Rose (Editors).","Bans of probability measures; Intelligent monitoring; Secure architectures; Statistical decision functions","Decision making; Network security; Probability distributions; Set theory; Statistics; Control and monitoring systems; Intelligent monitoring; Probability measures; Repeated application; Secure architectures; Statistical classification; Statistical criterion; Statistical decision; Monitoring"

The extension includes the application of the enterprise model frame to capture enterprise views and relationships of the analysed system assets. Although the proposal was used in some practical settings, the main goal of this work is conceptual discussion of the proposal.

While the focus of a SOC is on the monitoring of technical security controls and critical assets, and the response to attacks and threats, CSIRTs' main focus is on response and incident management. One postulation is that a CSIRT or CERT is a highly specialised sub-capability of a SOC, whereas another postulation could be that a SOC serves as an input mechanism into CSIRTs and CERTs. In this paper, the differences between SOCs, CERTs and CSIRTs are established, and synergies between them are defined. This leads to an integrated services model for the establishment of an initial SOC and CSIRT capability in developing countries. Developing countries have unique challenges facing them where it concerns cybersecurity. Aspects such as Information Communication and Technology (ICT) infrastructure are often a challenge, and so is funding for ICT as well as skills. Political instability could also have an influence on the cybersecurity posture of developing countries by leaving developing nations open to malicious state-sponsored attacks. This SOC and CSIRT capability is made viable and possible through the savings in cost and resources by identifying overlapping services, as well as the application of the proposed model. This emergent SOC and CSIRT combined capability is called the Embryonic Cyberdefense Monitoring and Incident Response Center (E-CMIRC). The purpose of this paper is to identify a high-level integrated services model for the E-CMIRC in order to reduce cost and resources which serves as a barrier to entry in developing countries. A scalable operational framework is identified, and for the management of the effectiveness and efficiency, and also to ensure that all aspects of service delivery are considered, the Information Technology Information Library (ITIL) is proposed.","CSIRTs; Developing countries; Security; Service integration; SOCs","Cybersecurity; Emergency services; Computer emergency response teams; Computer security incident response team; Cyber-defense; Embryonics; Incident response; Integrated services models; Security; Security incident; Security operation center; Services integrations; Developing countries"

Through a narrative overview, a selection of open source Container-Based emulators are analysed to collect information regarding the technologies used to construct them to assess the current state of this emerging technology. Container-Based Emulators allows the creation of small emulated networks on commodity hardware through the use of kernel level virtualization techniques, also referred to as containerisation. Container-Based Emulators act as a management tool to control containers and the applications that execute within them. The ability of Container Based Emulators to create repeatable and controllable test networks makes it ideal for use as training and experimentation tools in the information security and network management fields. Due to the ease of use and low hardware requirements, the tools present a low cost alternative to other forms of network experimentation platforms. Through a review of current literature and source code, the current state of Container-Based Emulators is assessed. The primary source of information is publications by the creators of the selected Container-Based Emulators. Each Container-Based Emulator is introduced with a brief summary of the history and requirements that lead to its creation. The reader is presented with a comparison of the specific kernel level virtualization technologies used to implement the virtualization sub-system of the Container-Based Emulator. The structural design of Container-Based Emulators is analysed and summarized to provide a concise view of the capabilities that users are presented with. An architectural model is introduced that can assist with the selection of a Container-Based Emulator, based on the requirements of the end user. The paper concludes with a summary of the current state of Container-Based Emulators, and proposes future research areas to be explored.","Container-Based Emulator; Containerisation; Linux; Network emulation","Containers; Information management; Open source software; Structural design; Virtual reality; Virtualization; 'current; Commodity hardware; Container-based emulator; Containerization; Emerging technologies; Linux platform; Management tool; Network emulation; Open-source; Virtualization Techniques; Linux"

Each of these LIS deploys an organisational-driven information security policy that meets its local information sharing context needs. Nevertheless, incorporating these LIS in collaborative PC care brings multiple inconsistent policies together, which raises a number of information security threats that can block the CT access to critical information across a patient's treatment journey. Using an empirical study, this chapter identifies information security threats that can cause the issue, and defines a common collaboration-driven information security design.

In 2015, Tzeng et al. proposed an IBBV scheme which was published in IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology. Their scheme has superior performance than other existing similar schemes in terms of security, computation cost and transmission overhead by performance evaluations. However, one time signature verification of their scheme needs two bilinear pairing operations. As it is well known, bilinear pairing is one of the most time-consuming operation in modern cryptography. Therefore, some efforts can be made to prevent the appearance of pairing and obtain better efficiency. In this paper, we propose an improved scheme of Tzeng et al.’s IBBV. Our improved IBBV scheme needs not use bilinear pairing without the lack of security and privacy-preserving. The total computation cost for signing and verifying is the constant 1.2 ms for single message and n messages respectively, which is far better performance than Tzeng et al. scheme and other similar schemes. So our improved IBBV scheme is more suitable for practical use. Finally, we apply the recovering technology of the vehicle’s real identity of Tzeng et al.’s IBBV scheme to a public key authentication scheme for mobile Ad-hoc networks to address an improved pairing-free authentication scheme. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Ad hoc network; Authentication scheme; Identity-based batch verification; Information security; Pairing-free Diffie-Hellman; Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)","Ad hoc networks; Aluminum; Authentication; Data privacy; Efficiency; Intelligent computing; Mobile ad hoc networks; Network security; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Telecommunication networks; Authentication scheme; Batch verification; Diffie Hellman; Public key authentication; Security and privacy; Transmission overheads; Vehicle ad-hoc networks; Vehicular technologies; Vehicular ad hoc networks"

But the days when an organization's chief executive would walk the plant and point out safety or manufacturing concerns to the floor supervisor are long gone, despite the popularity of ""undercover boss"" type programming. It is much more likely that C-Suite executives have very little visibility into the day-to-day processes and tools their employees utilize, as the knowledge economy has increased worker specialization and employee tasks are much closer to bespoke processes. In response to this new type of working environment, employees are choosing their own tools, preferences, and applications, and integrating those into their organization's day-to-day activities. This in turn, may cause difficulties associated with top-down management of information, security governance and strategic planning. Traditional office paraphernalia-like photo frames and potted plants-are now internet of things (IOT)-enabled bring-your-own-devices (BYOD) which, quite unlike the plants pose significant challenges and risks to the organization's information technology infrastructure and create further challenges associated with insider threats, whether intentional or not. This technological revolution, its impact on worker activity and an increased possibility of intentional and unintentional insider threats is not without a silver lining. The underpinnings of the technologies that allow workers to better do their day-to-day work can also enable executives to focus on the important data points of an employee's behaviors and activities, one can then summarize and present those data points in an intelligible way to support and provide a defensible platform for corporate decision making. In this paper, we highlight some of these modern tools and explain how they may be used within the organization to look at a number of insider threats, including ongoing fraud and corporate malfeasance. We also looked at unintentional ""bad practices"" that, while not directed towards corporate harm may expose the organization to data breach or other leakage issues and some of the newest trends that incorporate behavioral analytics to identify those employees most likely to engage in harmful activities, before the employees have taken the first ""wrong"" step down that path. This paper will also examine the care with which these tools should be deployed and suggest some constraints for their operation and use. Finally, we will review how the data from these tools can best be distilled into reports appropriate for C-Suite review and utilization in support of executive decision making while still considering privacy and other employee and legal issues.","C-Suite; Cybersecurity; Fraud; Insider threats","Behavioral research; C (programming language); Crime; Decision making; Internet of things; C-suite; Corporates; Cyber security; Datapoints; Decisions makings; Degree of specificity; Fraud; Insider Threat; Knowledge economy; Workers'; Cybersecurity"

The rise in cyber-crime, digital currency, and e-governance has been well met by a corresponding recent jump in investment in new technology for securing computers around the globe. Business and government sectors have begun to focus effort on comprehensive cyber security solutions. With this effort has emerged a need for greater collaboration between research and industry fields. Despite much effort, there is still too little cross-disciplinary collaboration in the realm of computer security. This paper reviews the new trends, contributions, and identifiable limitations in cyber security research. We argue that these limitations are due largely to the lack of interdisciplinary cooperation required to address a problem that is clearly multifaceted. We then identify a need for further refinement of standard cyber security terminology to facilitate interdisciplinary cooperation, and propose guidelines for the global Internet multistakeholder community to consider when crafting such standards. We also assess the viability of some specific jargon, including whether cyber should be a separate word when used as a descriptor (e.g. cyber-crime or cybercrime), and conclude with recommendations for terminology use when writing papers on cyber security or the new broader field of all things relating to cyberspace, which has recently been dubbed Cybermatics, a term we also examine and propose alternatives to. By furthering the effort to standardize cyber security terminology, this paper lays groundwork for cross-disciplinary collaboration, interaction between technical and nontechnical stakeholders, and drafting of universal Internet governance laws. © 2016 IEEE.","critical infrastructure; Cyber security; cyber-crime; cybersecurity; cyberspace; dictionaries; hacker; ICT; information technology; internet; national security; standardization; standards","Computer crime; Computers; Crime; Critical infrastructures; Economics; Glossaries; Government data processing; Industrial research; Information technology; Internet; Investments; Personal computing; Security of data; Security systems; Standardization; Standards; Terminology; Cross-disciplinary collaborations; Cyber security; Cyber-crimes; Cyberspaces; hacker; Interdisciplinary communications; Interdisciplinary cooperations; Internet governance; National security"

The reaching of the targets presented in the strategies often requires interaction and collaboration with the information and communication system and services providers. Most of the providers are global or local business actors. This challenges the implementation of the strategies. Legislations, the forming of agreements as well as the defining of requirements for products and systems are typical means for enhancing and controlling cyber security in society. This paper addresses the implementation of cyber security strategy from social systems and the leadership activities point of view. Especially, the paper studies leadership activities with the implementation of cyber security strategy in the public-private relations area. A preliminary leadership matrix model is presented for illustrating and classifying activities typically related to leadership activities in an organization: governance, leadership, managing and administration. A social system model is referred for increasing understanding about the influence of these activities on complex systems involving human activities. The leadership matrix model and social system model are applied in a case study for demonstrating the approach. The empirical data of the case study consist of a cyber strategy implementation plan. The paper classifies the activities of the implementation plan according to the leadership matrix model by using the content analysis research technique. This illustrates the focus of the implementation plan from the leadership activities point of view. These results are studied with the social system model for having a preliminary view of the influence of the implementation plan. This preliminary view is compared with the evaluations of the impacts of the activities of the implementation plan.","Content analysis; Cyber security strategy; Leadership; System modelling","Content analysis; Cybe security strategy; Cyber security; Leadership; Leadership activities; Matrix model; Public-private; Security strategies; Social systems; System models; Cybersecurity"

The goal of the OS Friendly Architecture is to provide a high performance and secure microprocessor and OS system. We are interested in cyber security, information technology (IT), and SCADA control professionals reviewing the hardware level security features. The OS Friendly Architecture is a switched set of cache memory banks in a pipeline configuration. For light-weight threads, the memory pipeline configuration provides near instantaneous context switching times. The pipelining and parallelism provided by the cache memory pipeline provides for background cache read and write operations while the microprocessor's execution pipeline is running instructions. The cache bank selection controllers provide arbitration to prevent the memory pipeline and microprocessor's execution pipeline from accessing the same cache bank at the same time. This separation allows the cache memory pages to transfer to and from level 1 (L1) caching while the microprocessor pipeline is executing instructions. Computer security operations are implemented in hardware. By extending Unix file permissions bits to each cache memory bank and memory address, the OSFA provides hardware level computer security. © 2016 SPIE.","Computer security; Context switch; DMA/controller and cache bank pipeline; Microprocessor; OS","Cache memory; Computer architecture; Computer operating systems; Hardware; Hardware security; Memory architecture; Microprocessor chips; Osmium; Pipelines; Reconfigurable hardware; Security of data; Security systems; Context switch; Context switching; Hardware performance; Information assurance; Microprocessor architectures; Pipeline configuration; Security features; Security operations; Computer hardware"

Yet, in comparison with the burgeoning academic and commercial literature on the related field of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), CCI remains vastly unexplored. Outside the circles of governments' security apparatus, some large corporates and niche vendors that offer such specialised services, CCI is still obscure. While interest is gradually growing in CCI, this academic discipline is very young and largely uncharted. Leveraging off previous research by the aforementioned authors, this paper advances two further building blocks to contribute towards constructing this emerging discipline. Building block 1 comprises a distinction between CCI and CTI. Such a distinction is necessary for clarity and has the advantages of allowing CCI to benefit from the extensive research work done in the CTI field. Building block 2 consists of a multi-layered framework that explicates the different levels on which CCI functions, namely the strategic, operational and tactical functional levels. This framework progresses building block 1. While these functional levels have been described extensively in CTI literature, no such CCI-specific application could be found in literature within the public domain. Since it expounds CCI on the various levels that it functions, the framework contributes to a more nuanced academic conceptualisation of this discipline of CCI. On a practical level, the framework could serve as a notional guide for performing actual CCI work more effectively. The article concludes by reiterating the importance of CCI in addressing advanced threats and suggesting areas for further research.","Cyber Counterintelligence; Cyber counterintelligence levels; Cyber counterintelligence maturity; Cyber Threat Intelligence; Offensive cybersecurity","Buildings; Building blockes; Cybe counterintelligence; Cybe counterintelligence level; Cybe counterintelligence maturity; Cybe threat intelligence; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Functional levels; Government security; Offensive cybersecurity; Cybersecurity"

In this context, one must assume that attackers are continuously engaged in offence and an attack can potentially escalate in a compromised system. This paper proposes an approach to generate defensive responses against ongoing attacks. We use Attack-Defence Trees (ADTrees) to represent situational information including the state of the system, potential attacks and defences, and the interdependencies between them. Currently, ADTrees do not support automated response generation. To this end, we develop a game-theoretic approach to calculate defensive responses and implement our approach using the Game Theory Explorer (GTE). In our games, Attackers and Defenders are the players, the pay-offs model the benefit to each player for a given course of action, and the game's equilibria is the optimal course of action for each player. Finally, given the dynamic nature of cyber systems, we keep our ADTrees and the corresponding game trees upto-date following the well-known OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loop methodology.","Attack modelling; Cyber defences; Game Theory; Incident response; Security","Cybersecurity; Forestry; Trees (mathematics); Attack modeling; Course of action; Cyber systems; Cyber-defense; Defense response; Government organizations; Incident response; Military organizations; Potential attack; Security; Game theory"

Reliable ISRM represents a challenge for organizations, since they take security related decisions based on outdated data, overlook vulnerabilities, threats or common incidents. To overcome these issues the acquisition of shared cyber security information at the right time supports ISRM to reduce risks, identify attacks, and enhance resilience of an IS. However, the exchange and acquisition of shared cyber security information represents a major challenge in ISRM.

This kind of organizational structure is used by intelligence agencies throughout the world to provide security against a breach, thus ensuring the safety of the members. This well-known intelligence organization is applied to solve an advanced cyber security issue. A relatively new kind of a cyber threat known as an Advanced Persistent Threat (APTs) has been around for some time now, Stuxnet being the very first identified. There are several points to consider when identifying the characteristics of an APT, such as the aim, its interactions with Internet, way of collecting information, operations they do disrupt and concealment mechanisms utilized. An important aspect is whether it is statistically analyzable or dynamically identifiable, that its communication patterns need to be inspected to identify the characteristics. The traces of an APT might be identified this way. In this research, a honeypot network with a communication policy based on a clandestine cell is introduced. Each honeypot only knows a hub. And a hub only knows the main malware analysis server. By utilizing this approach, the communications are hidden from possible attackers without compromising the main server. In each honeypot server, dead-ends are created and implemented in the honeypot servers. Advantages and ramifications are discussed regarding the types of malware. It is aimed to create yet another taxonomy of malware regarding the network activities as they are being trapped by our introduced honeypot network. A clandestine cell format is one of its kind within organizations. This is the very first time that such kind of format is being applied to honeypot design for APT hunting. This is the paper in which an intelligence organizational structure meets with a network architecture in order to solve a very hard to crack cyber security problem. The idea itself is a new and untried one.","Advanced persistent threats; Clandestine Cell; Clandestine network organizations; Honeypots","Cybersecurity; Cytology; Malware; Network architecture; Network security; Advanced persistent threat; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Cell/BE; Clandestine cell; Clandestine network organization; Clandestine networks; Honeypots; Intelligence organizations; Network organization; Cells"

This reliance shows a growing emphasis on strategic importance of cyberspace (Sharma, 2010). While organisations and individuals are keenly exploiting the benefits of cyberspace, these same platforms have also opened new avenues for nefarious actors in the pursuit of their criminal activities to attack, disrupt, or steal from organisations and individuals. Criminal organisations and lone criminals worldwide have access to powerful, evolving capabilities which they use to identify and target their victims allowing for the perpetration of a wide variety of cyber crimes. This paper discusses ways in which utilising methods from typically non-cyber disciplines - business and criminology - can successfully be applied to the cyber domain in order to help in the fight against and prevention of cyber crime. Through the provision of a visual representation, this paper clarifies how journey mapping and crime scripting can help in building an understanding of the steps criminals undertake during execution of a cyber crime. In essence, within our work we have deconstructed the lifecycle of a crime events and translated these into a visualisation map to show the full event process, highlighting key steps as well as positive and negative events.

Secure network is a prime objective for the survival of any organization. Network monitoring and defence systems have become an integral part of network security for identifying and preventing potential attacks. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) are network based defence systems which combines Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and a firewall. In contrast to IDS, IDPS is a proactive technique which provides both quick reactions to potential threats and attacks in a network as well as preventing the attacks from entering the network. Current generation IDPS have their limitations on their performance and effectiveness. Some studies have proven that the modern IDPS have difficulties in dealing with high-speed network traffic. Meeting the current network requirements there exist several research approaches to find an efficient IDPS. Nevertheless, serious security and privacy breaches still occur every day, creating an absolute necessity to provide secure and safe information security systems. This survey provides an up-to-date comprehensive review on state of the art of IDPS based on different accelerating techniques, different detection algorithms, types of hardware and optimizing algorithms to match the demand requirements of high speed network. A detailed overview on high performance IDS and IDPS along with pros and cons of individual techniques will be given.

In this work we present Apparatus, a conceptual model for reasoning about security in IoT systems through the lens of Security Requirements Engineering. Apparatus is architecture-oriented and describes an IoT system as a cluster of nodes that share network connections. The information of the system is documented in a textual manner, using Javascript Notation Object (JSON) format, in order to elicit security requirements. To demonstrate its usage the security requirements of a temperature monitor system are identified and a first application of Apparatus is exhibited. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Information security; Internet of things; IoT conceptual model; Security requirements engineering","Cluster computing; Information systems; Internet; Requirements engineering; Security of data; Systems engineering; Ubiquitous computing; Cluster of nodes; Conceptual model; Internet of Things (IOT); Network connection; Security requirements; Security requirements engineering; Temperature monitor; Through the lens; Internet of things"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper includes a critical review of global information security management issues for HSOs and relevant multi-disciplinary organizational theories to address them. Findings: Effective information security management can be particularly challenging to HSO because of their use of volunteer staff in a borderless electronic environment. Organizations’ lack of recognition of the need for staff awareness of information security threats and for training in secure work practices, particularly in terms of maintaining clients’ privacy and confidentiality, is a major issue. The dynamic theory of organizational knowledge creation, organizational culture theory and contingency theory were identified as the most suitable theoretical perspectives to address this issue and underpin an effective information security management framework for HSOs. Research limitations/implications: The theory-based framework presented here has not been tested in practice. Such testing will be carried out in further research. Originality/value: Currently, there is no framework for information security systems in HSOs. The framework developed here provides a foundation on which HSO can build information security systems specific to their needs. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer crime; Human information behaviour; Human service organizations; Information security; Information security management; Organizational theories",""

The study was conducted with 607 secondary education students in various secondary education institutions. In the first phase of the study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted with 407 participating students. As a result of the EFA, it was determined that the scale consists of 36 items and 3 subscales (‘attacks and threats: At’, ‘privacy: Pr’ and ‘the protection of personal data: Ppd’). In the second phase of the study, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted with 200 participating students. Three-factor structure was confirmed. Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient is.955 for the entire scale; and At:.954, Pr:.890 and Ppd:.808, respectively, for each subscale. Consequently, a valid and reliable scale that can be used to determine the level of information security awareness of secondary education students has been developed.

This study aims to assess users' knowledge of security warnings communicated via browser indicators and the likelihood that their online decision-making adheres to this knowledge. Design/methodology/approach-Participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk visited a series of secure and insecure websites and decided as quickly and as accurately as possible whether it was safe to login. An online survey was then used to assess their knowledge of information security. Findings-Knowledge of information security was not necessarily a good predictor of decisions regarding whether to sign-in to a website. Moreover, these decisions were modulated by attention to security indicators, familiarity of the website and psychosocial stress induced by bonus payments determined by response times and accuracy. Practical implications-Even individuals with security knowledge are unable to draw the necessary conclusions about digital risks when browsing the web.

However, the information security issue of high-speed networks is still a big problem. As an important branch of information security, steganography is a useful method to protect confidential information. In this paper, by combining the trailing coefficient produced in the process of the quantization ofthe H.264 encoding standard with the current video steganographic algorithms, we implement a new kind of algorithm based on trailing coefficients. The algorithm firstly conducts a DCT transform on the frame, and then it obtains the trailing coefficient for each quantized DCT block;lastly, the secret information bit is embedded into the video. The experimental result indicates that this algorithm has little influence on video quality and has a large capacity of steganography;also, it has a strong anti-steganalysis capability and high robustness.","Information security; Steganography; Trailing coefficients; Video","Algorithms; HIgh speed networks; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Network security; Security of data; Confidential information; High robustness; Secret information; Steganographic algorithms; Trailing coefficients; Video; Video quality; Video steganography; Steganography"

The purpose of the test described in this paper is to investigate if information security risk is perceived in this way, if decision-making style influences the perceived relationship between the three variables and if the level of information security expertise influences the relationship between the three variables. Design/methodology/approach-Ten respondents assessed 105 potential information security incidents. Ratings of the associated risks were obtained independently from ratings of the probability and severity of the incidents. Decision-making style was measured using a scale inspired from the Cognitive Style Index; information security expertise was self-reported. Regression analysis was used to test the relationship between variables. Findings-The ten respondents did not assess risk as the product of probability and severity, regardless of experience, expertise and decision-making style. The mean variance explained in risk ratings using an additive term is 54.0 or 38.4 per cent, depending on how risk is measured. When a multiplicative term was added, the mean variance only increased by 1.5 or 2.4 per cent. For most of the respondents, the contribution of the multiplicative term is statistically insignificant. Practical Implications-The inability or unwillingness to see risk as a product of probability and severity suggests that procedural support (e.g. risk matrices) has a role to play in the risk assessment processes. Originality/value-This study is the first to test if information security risk is assessed as an interaction between probability and severity using suitable scales and a within-subject design. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Information security risk assessment; Perceived; Perceived probability; Risk perception; Severity","Decision making; Probability; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Security of data; Assessment process; Cognitive style indices; Empirical test; Information security incidents; Information security risk assessment; Information security risks; Perceived; Severity; Risks"

This paper proposes a geometrical model that represents the volume of attacks and countermeasures based on a threedimensional coordinate system (i.e. user, channel, and resource). The CARVER methodology is used to give an appropriate weight to each entity composing the axes in the coordinate system. These weights represent the criticality of the different system entities.

This dilemma has puzzled the people who are concerned, especially senior leaders. It clearly indicates that there are flaws in the current approaches in cyber defense. A close examination of these approaches reveals that they are generally static in nature, i.e. they have not been architectured to be flexible enough in dealing with variations of the same attacks or zero-day types of attacks, and the whole defense posture is fortress-based defense. Hence, dynamic cyber defense is naturally called for. Coupled with the proposal for dynamic defense provided by Lamb et al. (2012) is the proposal for Moving Target Defense (MTD), which is ""continuously changing a system's attack surface"" to thwart cyber attacks, according to Casola et al. (2013). However, it is not clear when a change should be initiated, what change should be used, and how long one change should last. What is more, making an asset a truly randomized moving target for MTD is always a big challenge. This paper intends to explore an innovative answer to address these challenges. It proposes a new strategic and systematic solution applying the Cybersecurity Strategy Formation Framework put forward in Chen (2014). Specifically, the proposed solution utilizes the concept of contextual analysis in figuring out cost-effective and function-effective course of actions in randomizing the appearance of asset guided by contexts. This solution is then applied to a specific scenario for to prove the concepts. The areas for further research are also suggested. This paper improves the research in dynamic cyber defense, which employs game-changing elements such as adaptiveness and complexity.","Contexts; Contextual analysis; Cyber; Dynamic defense; Moving target defense","Cost effectiveness; Embedded systems; Network security; Computing system; Contexts; Contextual analysis; Course of action; Cyber; Embedded computing system; Moving target defense; Private sectors; Computer crime"

To tackle the problems of the existing educations, in this paper, we examine a way to prevent cybercrimes using learning contents related to a real life, help learners to improve awareness of cybercrimes and realize their seriousness through an indirect experience of them. We develop a program with learning contents based on a simulation for preventing cybercrimes. Furthermore, we provide a quiz game to enhance the understanding of the cybercrimes.

Information system security models and information assurance constructs seek to achieve information assurance, a high degree of certainty in the confidentiality, integrity and availability of cyber-systems supporting combat operations. This paper argues that the information assurance approach, whilst a worthy goal, is not reflective of the lessons of history or warfare. Historically, nations have consistently assumed that their wartime communications systems were secure, whilst their adversaries were reading important diplomatic cables, strategic and tactical messages. Mayfield's paradox mathematically demonstrates the futility of attempting to make any information or command and control system completely assured against every attack. The Military Cyber-Maturity Model presented within this paper adopts a pragmatic view, assuming that the adversary is technically capable and intelligent. This model embraces the possibility of an adversary utilizing an unknown vulnerability to attack the system, and expends resources to deal with the result of the successful attack rather than relying entirely on an impregnable defense. This approach extends beyond the assumption that a cyber-attack immediately causes mission failure, by recognizing that each cyber-attack has different requirements and outcomes and will affect different assets and processes. The Military Cyber-Maturity Model seeks to model business continuity through a high degree of cultural change, embedded work practices that parallel analogue and digital work practices with deceptive counterintelligence behavior. The Military Cyber-Maturity Model incorporates the concepts of behavioral defense and mission assurance to provide agility and increase the likelihood of success in combat. Information deception provides a behavioral defense, creating uncertainty and doubt in the adversary's mind and reducing the degree of trust they have in the information available. Degeneracy leads to mission assurance, by providing the ability to absorb shock and catastrophic system attacks. In the same manner that modern physical battlefields have been transformed by hybrid and asymmetric threats, the cyber-environment has the capacity to evolve further through the employment of integrated information deception and organisational degeneracy. The Military Cyber-Maturity Model embraces this approach. The Military Cyber-Maturity Model provides a methodology for preparing modern, cyber-enabled military forces for future conflicts against technologically capable adversaries. This paper introduces the model, outlines its aims, components and justifications. This work also outlines the need for simulation and testing to validate the model's effectiveness, and introduces a number of potential use-cases.","Cyber; Information assurance; Maturity model; Military cyber-effects; Security model","Command and control systems; Crime; Military operations; Cyber; Information assurance; Maturity model; Military cyber-effects; Security model; Computer crime"

There are new phenomena such as Cyber-Mobbing and Cyberbullying (Happy Slapping, Alienation, Extortion of confidential information, ""Flaming"", Slander, etc.) or ""Factories of Trolls"". The usage by some countries of the provocation strategy consists of the organization of information warfare so that the resources of the opponent are directed against him. Today unilateral statements that this or that state can be involved in illegal actions in information field, it is not enough to attribute the given harmful activity to this state. The charges of the states in the organization and realization of cyber attacks should be proved. The author concentrates on exploring prospects and challenges of digital diplomacy in the international field with special reference to Russia. In the paper, the author used the results of his comparative analysis of digital activity of the embassies of Russia in the world and statistical methods in the processing and strategic assessment of the data of Report of the 18th Russian Internet Forum. The paper presents modern techniques of reaching political audiences through digital diplomacy, which on the one hand, provides new opportunities for the implementation of international politics, and on the other, imposes special requirements on its members. The paper examines the consequences of the growing influence of the Internet on global politics, including the possibility of large-scale public opinion manipulation. The results of OSINT research have unveiled hyperactivity of terrorist organisations in networks. The paper centers on the Russian experience to oppose such tools as compulsory recruitment and others. The paper focuses on a new form of public diplomacy and shows its mechanism of influence on foreign audiences. It is shown that there is an inverse relation between the diplomatic and public offices (a new phenomenon of the modern information society). Basing on the digital activity of Russian embassies in Latin America and Caribbean basin the author stresses the role of social media in shaping public opinion, which puts forward specific requirements for how information is supplied on the official pages of diplomatic offices in social networks. The new format of close cooperation between a society and diplomatic agencies makes the modern diplomacy on the one hand more open and public, and less restrained on the other. At the same time the Ministry of Defense and other state structures of Russia in recent years have been paying special attention to strengthening cybersecurity and continue the national strategy buildup in that area. The complexity of the solution all the above questions lies primarily in the imperfection of international law in the regulation of the information space.","Cyber terrorism; Cybersecurity; Digital diplomacy; Foreign policy; Geopolitics; International relations; Social networks; Soft power; Trolling","Complex networks; Crime; Internet; Laws and legislation; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Terrorism; Cyber security; Cyber terrorism; Digital diplomacy; Foreign policy; Geopolitics; International relations; Soft power; Trolling; Computer crime"

Are ideological and cultural issues key factors, or are personal psychological motives more useful in assessing the threat? Do lone actors evolve in a broader social context or are they primarily fixated loners? What response strategies are available to security services and law enforcement? What is the future outlook for this particular terroristthreat? Although these issues are frequently discussed, few books have taken a global perspective as their primary focus. While many books focus on lone actor terrorists in relation to terrorist groups, such as Al-Qaida and the Islamic State, few, if any, cover lone actors of all ideological backgrounds, including the variants of active shooters and malicious insiders in information security, such as Edward Snowden – with both of these latter categories constituting an important variant of lone actors.

In addition, by using fake base station attacks, attackers can get mobile terminal identity and eavesdropping, impersonation of mobile terminal and base station and other types of man-in-the-middle attacks can be taken place. Therefore, detection of fake base station attacks and warning mobile terminal users and GSM operators would be pretty important. In this work, fake base station attacks are analyzed. Then, fake base station attack detection algorithm is developed. Besides, by the help of proposed algorithm, feasibility of fake base station attack detection has been shown by simulation which is based on real GSM network values.","Attack detection; Fake base station attacks; GSM security; Man-in-the-middle attacks","Algorithms; Base stations; Computer terminals; Global system for mobile communications; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Security of data; Signal detection; Attack detection; Fake base station attacks; GSM base stations; Man in the middle attacks; Mobile terminal; Mutual authentication; Security leak; Security problems; Mobile security"

In the recent years network security has become an important concern. Cryptography plays a vital role in the information security system against various attacks. Efficient and newer versions of cryptography techniques can help to reduce this security threat. The Advanced Encryption Standard is a strong symmetric key cryptographic algorithm which uses a number of table look ups to increase its performance. The Cache Timing Attack correlates the timing details for encryption under a known key with an unknown key to infer the unknown key. This paper proposes an extension of a public-key cryptosystem to support a private key cryptosystem which is a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard and ECC. The past results have been computed on the basis of AES key length as 128 bit and no. of iterations as 10.To increase competency and to minimize drawbacks this paper proposes a hybrid encryption scheme. The parameters to be studied will primarily focus on the key length, no. of iterations and the type of side channel attack to be implemented.

With the rapid development of communication technology and the Internet, people pay more and more attention to personal privacy. As a result, the research on anonymous communication system is gradually increasing. P2P network's openness and the unpredictability of malicious nodes make the network user's privacy information more vulnerable to illegal theft. The attacker can not only get the contents of the file, but also can get the identity and other related privacy information of the sender and receiver. Anonymous technology is the best way to solve the privacy protection. Therefore, it is of important theoretical significance and application value to study the anonymous technology in P2P network environment.

Design/methodology/approach-An empirical study is conducted at four intervals over eight years across 12 countries using a validated information security culture assessment (ISCA) questionnaire. Findings-The overall information security culture average scores as well as individual statements for all four survey assessments were significantly more positive for employees who had read the information security policy compared with employees who had not. The overall information security culture also improved from one assessment to the next. Research limitations/implications-The information security culture should be measured and benchmarked over time to monitor change and identify and prioritise actions to improve the information security culture. If employees read the information security policy, it has a positive influence on the information security culture of an organisation. Practical implications-Organisations should ensure that employees have read the information security policy to aid in minimising the human risk, related errors and incidents and, ultimately, to instil a stronger information security culture with a higher level of compliant behaviour. Originality/value-This research confirms theoretical research indicating that the information security policy could influence the information security culture positively. It provides novel and statistical evidence illustrating that if employees read the information security policy, they have a stronger information security culture and that the culture can be improved through targeted interventions using an ISCA. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Assessment; Culture; Factors; Influence; Information security; Policy","Cell culture; Public policy; Security systems; Surveys; Assessment; Empirical studies; Factors; Influence; Information security cultures; Information security policies; Statistical evidence; Theoretical research; Security of data"

This paper also describes how biometrics can leverage cloud's boundless computational resources and striking properties of exibility, scalability, and cost reduction in order to reduce the cost of the biometrics system requirements of different computational resources (i.e. processing power or data storage) and to enhance the performance of biometrics systems' processes (i.e. biometric matching). Here, Raspberry Pi is used to build a low-cost biometric system. Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a credit-sized mini-computer with great capabilities similar to a PC. In this study it is used as a remote enrollment node. The application of Raspberry Pi and cloud computing has given a new direction of research into the field of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Using the biometric technology, a new system of IoT based biometrics is proposed. To maintain the security of biometric traits over the Internet channel from RPi client to the cloud, cryptographic algorithms are applied like RSA and enhanced AES-256. The encrypted biometric information is stored on the cloud and the authentication can be done by Biometric service hosted on Azure cloud. Thus, this papers covers the following topics: attracting power of biometrics into the authentication services, biometrics leveraging the power of cloud, Raspberry Pi- a low-cost IoT device, enhanced AES-256 with Round structure and dynamic S-box generation and the new emerging trend of Internet-of-Things. © 2016 The Authors.","AES-256 encryption; biometric security; biometrics; cloud; cryptography; Internet-of-Things (IoT); Raspberry Pi (RPi)","Authentication; Biometrics; Clouds; Cost reduction; Costs; Cryptography; Data handling; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Internet; Minicomputers; Security of data; Virtual reality; Authentication services; Biometric informations; Biometric security; Biometric technology; Computational resources; Cryptographic algorithms; Internet of Things (IOT); Raspberry Pi (RPi); Internet of things"

Authorized users should access the system or information. Authorization can't occur without authentication. For this authentication various techniques are available. Among them the most popular and easy is the password technique. Password ensures that computer or information can be accessed by those who have been granted right to view or access them. Traditional password technique is a textual password which is also called alphanumeric password. But these textual passwords are easy to crack through various types of attack. So to overcome these vulnerabilities, a graphical password technique is introduced. As name suggests in this technique images (pictures) are used as a password instead of text. Also psychological study says that human can easily remember images than text. So according to this fact, graphical passwords are easy to remember and difficult to guess. But because of graphic nature, nearly all the graphical password techniques are vulnerable to shoulder surfing attack. So here, a new graphical password authentication technique is proposed which is resistant to shoulder surfing and also other types of possible attacks to some extent. It is a combination of recognition and recall based approach. It can be useful for smart held devices like smart phones, PDA, iPod, iPhone etc. © 2016 The Authors.","Authorization; Graphical Password; Security; Shoulder surfing","Security of data; Smartphones; Virtual reality; Alphanumeric passwords; Authorization; Authorized users; Graphical password; Graphical password techniques; Security; Shoulder surfing; Textual passwords; Authentication"

Here, we demonstrate a progressively complex anti-counterfeiting platform using a multiplex fabrication strategy. This multiplex strategy enabled us to realize a spatially selective encapsulation of dye molecules within an Ag nanopillar array embedding covert molecular information which was revealed using fluorescence, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and signal intensities. A total of five identification layers were used to authenticate products in our nanopillar platform. Moreover, two spectroscopic techniques were required to fully decode the various covert layers encoded within the same nanopillar array, thereby greatly enhancing the security of the information. Hyperspectral imaging was used to precisely generate unique SERS fingerprints of molecules encapsulated in each nanopillar. This feature combined with the high ∼17 000 pillars per inch (ppi) information density of the platform make its use extremely effective against counterfeiting and forgery. In summary, our encoding platform enables high security, large information density and low-error decoding. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Decoding; Encoding (symbols); Molecules; Multiplexing; Nanostructures; Raman scattering; Security of data; Spectroscopy; Surface scattering; Fabrication strategies; Hyperspectral Imaging; Information density; Molecular information; Multiple identifications; Selective encapsulation; Spectroscopic technique; Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS); Mobile devices"

Secondly, the wavelet coefficients are transformed by 3D discrete Fourier transform, and the first lowfrequency coefficients (4*5*4) are selected. Then, the first low-frequency coefficients (4*5*4) are transformed by 3D discrete inverse Fourier transform to get the feature vector.

Information requires management. This also means that we are living in a world which is not only shaped and defined by the proclaimed freedom of information and one's opinion. Our world is also a state of managed public opinion and information. Manipulation of information has become the decisive form of persuasive power. But, while it is widespread, it has also become more subtle, more sophisticated, and less evident. Cyber warfare and information security are a highly urgent topic nowadays. Information progress, developing technologies and ever increasing number of specialists in this sphere prove its relevance. Numerous mistakes, various hazards, few rules and practically no positive experience of counteracting manipulation or defamation in the sphere of the internet present a daunting problem for specialists. With this in mind, it is worth considering the case of Latin American countries, analysing the peculiarities, tendencies and aspects of cyberattacks from the point of view of their manipulative potential. Leaving aside the technological aspects of the phenomenon of cyber-attacks let us consider the background of the attacks, dwell on the purposes, analyse the aftereffects, target audiences, and try to predict the circumstances. Another problem that occurs here is that the sphere of the internet is closely connected with the mass media. Wrong, incorrect or manipulative information resulting from information attacks is exaggerated by the mass media, which makes it next to impossible for an average user to distinguish between 'black and white' information. Communication management, on the one hand, is a way of managing people and the capitals by means of communication but, on the other hand, it has at its disposal a wide range of opportunities for analysis. Latin America is an interesting case from different points of view. Firstly, owing to fundamentally different target audiences (from indigenous people to urbanised youth). Secondly, from the point of view of strong integration processes on the continent which present a fertile ground for manipulations. Thirdly, the left turn in the politics of the countries on the continent is a target of numerous manipulations. According to the above, the proposed paper will try to trace the reasons of the attacks, the calculated effects and the manipulative potential. Big data analysis and predictive technologies are also analysed in the context of Latin America cyber warfare realities.","Communication management; Cyberwarfare; Information security; Latin America","Big data; Internet; Security of data; Social aspects; Spheres; Communication management; Cyberwarfare; Freedom of informations; Information attacks; Integration process; Latin America; Positive experiences; Technological aspects; Computer crime"

By experimenting on carefully-designed test suites, we explored the effectiveness of several static analysis tools that detect some of the most prevalent software weaknesses. We downloaded the Juliet Test Suite for Java from Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD) to test the selected static analysis tools. This test suite was created based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), a community-driven database of common software weaknesses. In an attempt to cover a large portion of developers, we chose tools that were open source, and written for Java. Specifically, we tested CodePro Analytix, JLint, FindBugs, and VisualCodeGrepper. We found a continuum of success among the tools, both in accuracy and in coverage of planted weakness detection. This result emphasizes the importance of the CWE in evaluating the performance of static analysis tools, and shows that there is room for improvement in the effectiveness of these tools. Although it is possible to eliminate weaknesses in code and make programs more efficient, static analysis does not guarantee the absence of runtime errors. Additionally, static analysis tool performance should be tested on specific weaknesses in both human-generated code and computer-generated code, to determine whether accuracy and coverage are comparable. The Juliet Test Suite that we used is comprised of computer-generated code, which may not have the same characteristics as human-generated code. Thus, further research is necessary to equally examine the weaknesses in human-generated code. We tested a handful of common weaknesses, but in order to show the true coverage of a static analysis tool, representative code for more CWEs should be tested.","CWE; Juliet test suite; Software vulnerability; Static analysis","Codes (symbols); Computer crime; Computer software; Open source software; Security of data; Software testing; Statistical tests; Analysis tools; Common software; Computer generated; Juliet test suite; Run-time errors; Software assurance; Software systems; Software vulnerabilities; Static analysis"

The potential yield of indium recycled from waste mobile phone is considerable. Recycling indium from waste mobile phones can alleviate the constraints of indium resources while gaining great economic benefit. However, there is no relevant research work to evaluate the potential yield of indium in the waste cell phone. This paper explores the main factors that constraint the efficiency of recycling by predicting potential yield of indium recycled from waste mobile phone, and puts forward the corresponding policy recommendations. The results are based on the Logistic model and Stock-base model and a survey. The results show that the potential yield of indium recycled from waste mobile phone from 2015 to 2035 will increase from 8.7 tonnes to 10.2 tonnes in China. However, the recovery rate of waste mobile phone is very low, the actual available amount is far lower than the potential yield of indium.

This paper introduces Attack-Defence Diagrams as a formalism to describe intricate attackdefence scenarios that can represent the above mentioned situational conditions. A diagram’s semantics naturally corresponds to a game where its players, the attacker and the defender, compete to turn the game’s outcome from undecided into a successful attack or defence, respectively. Attack-Defence Diagrams incorporate aspects of time, probability, and cost, so as to reflect timing of attack steps and countermeasures, their success chances, as well as skills and knowledge of the attacker and defender that may increase over time with lessons learned from previous attack steps. The semantics maps on stochastic timed automata as the underlying mathematical model in a compositional manner. This enables an efficient what-if quantitative evaluation to deliver cost and success estimates, as we demonstrate by a case study from the cybersecurity domain. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","","Personal computing; Semantics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Attack scenarios; Cyber security; Hacker attacks; Modelling tools; Quantitative evaluation; Sensitive datas; State of the art; Success chances; Cost benefit analysis"

On account of large scale reliance on information technology, affording maximum protection to data has become extremely essential to manage fluctuating business trends. By and large, Cryptographic Services are being employed to secure the data. Secure encryption, indeed, is a remedy against eavesdropping of sensitive information but its perceptibility - as something being gibberish - is sufficient enough to seek immediate attention of an onlooker which raises suspicion of some behind the scene activity. Hence, there felt a serious need to hide sensitive data in a manner such that its existence shall remain unknown to the unauthorized person. To address the perceptibility concern, various image based digital steganographic schemes have been introduced. However, it is observed that existing image-based digital steganographic schemes do not take into consideration the worst case scenario that the enemy can also have the possession of original cover. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper presents a novel steganographic scheme which is effective against known-cover attack. Furthermore, it provides greater cryptographic security by adhering to Kerckhoff's principal and successfully protects private or classified information, whether at rest or in transit. Our steganographic scheme provides a method to protect information by hiding it behind emoticons - a popular means of conversation in mobile communication and social media these days. A single emoticon in our scheme can conceal up to 8 bits of secret information. This scheme affords robustness via unique set of emoticons. We present twofold security via encryption and steganography. Hence, this scheme is most unlikely to raise suspicion of a hidden message even if original cover is known to the adversary. The proposed scheme is equally suitable for Chat, IM, SMS and email.","Cryptography; Data privacy; Encryption; Information assurance; Information security; Private texting; Secret messages; Secure communication information hiding; Security through obscurity; Steganography","Computer crime; Data privacy; Security of data; Steganography; Information assurance; Information hiding; Secret messages; Security through obscurity; Texting; Cryptography"

In order to look for better performances, unlike conventional schemes, we employ the difference between original and predicted images for hiding secret information at the encoder. We take the inherent characteristics of original image into account, and we employ prediction techniques to produce predicted image. With the alteration of difference histogram, acquired between predicted and original images, more amount of capacity for data embedding can be reached with similar output image quality in reversible data hiding. At the decoder, with the small amount of side information, both the original image and secret information can be extracted. This implies the reversibility of proposed algorithm. In addition, extracted secret information is authenticated to retain the ownership.

The overall success of an information security system depends on analysis of the risks and threats so that appropriate protection mechanism can be in place to protect them. However, lack of appropriate analysis of risks may potentially results in failure of information security systems. Existing literature does not provide adequate guidelines for a systematic process or an appropriate modelling language to support such analysis. This work aims to fill this gap by introducing the process and reason about the risks considering human factors. Design/methodology/approach-To develop risk-driven investment model along with the activities that support the process. These objectives were achieved through the collection of quantitative and qualitative data utilising requirements engineering and secure tropos methods. Findings-The proposed process and model lead to define a clear relationship between risks, incidents and investment and allows organisations to calculate them based on their own figures. Research limitations/implications-One of the major limitations of this model is that it only supports incident-based investment. This creates some sort of difficulties to be presented to the executive board. Secondly, because of the nature of human factors, quantification does not exactly reflect the monetary value of the factors. Practical implications-Applying the information security risk-driven investment model in a real case study shows that this can help organisations apply and use it in other incidents, and more importantly, to the incidents which critical human factors are a grave concern of organisations. The importance of providing a financial justification is clearly highlighted and provided for seeking investment in information security.

The aim of the research was to compare a self-reporting online survey with a set of one-on-one repertory grid technique interviews. More specifically, this research focussed on participant attitudes toward naive and accidental information security behaviours. Design/methodology/approach-In the first study, 23 university students responded to an online survey within a university laboratory setting that captured their attitudes toward behaviours in each of seven focus areas. In the second study, the same students participated in a one-on-one repertory grid technique interview that elicited their attitudes toward the same seven behaviours. Results were analysed using Spearman correlations. Findings-There were significant correlations for three of the seven behaviours, although attitudes relating to password management, use of social networking sites, information handling and reporting of security incidents were not significantly correlated. Research limitations/implications-The small sample size (n-23) and the fact that participants were not necessarily representative of typical employees, may have impacted on the results. Practical implications-This study contributes to the challenge of developing a reliable instrument that will assess individual InfoSec awareness. Senior management will be better placed to design intervention strategies, such as training and education of employees, if individual attitudes are known. This, in turn, will reduce risk-inclined behaviour and a more secure organisation. Originality/value-The literature review indicates that this study addresses a genuine gap in the research. © Commonwealth of Australia.","Information security (InfoSec); InfoSec behaviour; Repertory grid technique (RGT); Theory of planned behaviour","Personnel training; Security of data; Surveys; Information security behaviours; InfoSec behaviour; Repertory grid technique; Repertory Grid Technique (RGT); Social networking sites; Theory of planned behaviour; Training and education; University laboratories; Human resource management"

Research limitations/implications-Using this research approach, measurements could only be obtained for campaign messages depicted in artefacts. Future interventions should be designed to facilitate a more rigorous analysis of the audiences' interpretation of all campaign messages using ATT.

However, recent research has found a conflict between the predictions of contemporary fear appeal theory for how we expect individuals to experience fear appeals and what actually occurs in IS security situations. Using the opportunity presented by neuroimaging tools to examine cognitive and affective reactions to fear appeals, we take a comparative look at the contentions of fear appeal theory and the realities of what insiders experience neurologically when exposed to ecologically relevant IS security fear appeals. Our fMRI results suggest that fear appeals elicit threat and threat response assessments, which partially supports fear appeal theory but does not support the presence of an actual fear response. Furthermore, appraisals of recommended threat responses had a stronger impact on intentions to enact security behaviors than appraisals of the threat itself, which suggests that a focus on threats might be misplaced. Instead, focusing on ways to make the responses to the threats more appealing to users might work better. These controversial findings suggest future research that should explore how fear appeals play out in IS security and in what ways. © 2016 by the Association for Information Systems.","Affect; Cognition; Fear appeal theory; IS security; Neural correlates; Self-efficacy; Threat; Threat response","Neuroimaging; Affect; Cognition; Fear appeal theory; Information security managements; IS security; Management projects; Neural correlate; Self efficacy; Threat; Threat response; Security of data"

While most of the watermarking techniques use a constant strength factor for the whole image, in the present watermarking scheme a exible strength factor is used, which is derived from the standard deviations of the discrete wavelet transform coefficients of the selected high entropy nonoverlapping blocks. The presented watermarking scheme explains the reverse relationship between imperceptibility and robustness by various plots involving adjusting the parameter of strength factor. A watermarked image of any desired peak signal to noise ratio can be prepared very easily by using this scheme. Three versions of the proposed watermarking scheme are presented here. In the first version the host image is partitioned into 8 × 8 nonoverlapping blocks and these blocks are used in the watermarking. Similarly, in the second and third versions, the host image is partitioned into 16 × 16 and 32 × 32 blocks respectively for their use in watermarking. We compare the results of these three versions with other watermarking schemes and illustrate the greater robustness of all versions of our watermarking scheme. The novelty of the scheme lies in the use of three sizes of nonoverlapping blocks and the exible strength factor for every block of the image. © 2016 Tübitak.","Exible strength factor; Image-adaptive watermarking; Infor-mation hiding; Information security; Robust watermarking","Digital watermarking; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image watermarking; Security of data; Signal to noise ratio; Wavelet transforms; Adaptive watermarking; Infor-mation hiding; Peak signal to noise ratio; Robust watermarking; Robust watermarking scheme; Strength factor; Watermarking algorithms; Watermarking schemes; Watermarking"

The purpose of this paper is to testify the feasibility of this method and provide suggestions for improving information security of the digital library. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts convenience sampling to select respondents. The assessment of assets is through analyzing digital library-related business and function through a questionnaire which collects data to determine asset types and the importance of asset attributes. The five-point Likert scale questionnaire method is used to identify the threat possibility and its influence on the assets. The 12 respondents include directors and senior network technicians from the editorial department, comic library, children's library, counseling department and the learning promotion centre. Three different Guttman scale questionnaires, tool testing and on-site inspection are combined to identify and assess vulnerabilities. There were different Guttman scale questionnaires for management personnel, technical personnel and general librarian. In all, 15 management librarians, 7 technical librarians and 72 ordinary librarians answered the vulnerability questionnaire. On-site inspection was conducted on the basis of 11 control domains of ISO 27002. Vulnerabilities were scanned using remote security evaluation system NSFOCUS. The scanning covered ten IP sections and a total of 81 hosts. Findings - Overall, 2, 792 risk scores were obtained. Among them, 282 items (accounting for 10.1 per cent of the total) reached the high risk level; 2 (0.1 per cent) reached the very high risk level. High-risk items involved 26 threat types (accounting for 44.1 per cent of all threat types) and 13 vulnerability types (accounting for 22.1 per cent of all vulnerability types). The evaluation revealed that this digital library faces seven major hidden dangers in information security. The assessment results were well accepted by staff members of this digital library, which testified to the applicability of this method to a Chinese digital library. Research limitations/implications - This paper is only a case study of a typical Chinese digital library using a digital library information security assessment method. More case-based explorations are necessary to prove the feasibility of the assessing strategy proposed in this study. Originality/value - Based on the findings of recent literature, the authors found that very few researchers have made efforts to develop methods for calculating the indicators for digital library information security risk assessment. On the basis of ISO 27000 and other related information security standards, this case study proposed an operable method of digital library information security risk assessment and used it to assess a the information security of a typical Chinese digital library. This study can offer insights for formulating a digital library information security risk assessment scale. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital library; Information security; Risk assessment; Threats; Vulnerability","child; clinical article; controlled study; convenience sample; counseling; feasibility study; Guttman scale; human; human tissue; learning; librarian; library; Likert scale; questionnaire; risk assessment; scientist; staff; thinking"

The problems of enhancing the CIS resistance in conditions of introduction of new and modernization of existing information and automated control systems, with the increased number of destabilizing effects on the information availability, confidentiality and integrity are considered. It is shown that the cyber defense of CIS is monitored and analyzed by several parameters of the features of anomalies or cyber attacks. This, in turn, allows carrying out a preliminary information security evaluation via clustering of a feature set of anomalies or attempted cyber attacks. A categorical model for building the adaptive intelligent cyber threat detection system (ICTDS) is proposed. Using the fuzzy clustering procedure, the training algorithm of ICTDS with the ability of hyper ellipsoidal correction of decision rules is developed. This allows creating adaptive ICTDS self-training mechanisms. The efficiency of the algorithm of the ICTDS information- extreme training is checked. To evaluate the partitioning quality of the feature space of anomalies, vulnerabilities and cyber attacks, the choice of the rational number of clusters and the fuzziness index of clusters in the feature space is made. It is proved that the proposed approach allows solving complex problems of the CIS cyber defense control and can be used in the development of software solutions for cyber defense systems. © Valeriy Lakhno, 2016.","Anomalies; Critical information systems; Cyber security; Feature clustering; Information security; Information-extreme algorithm; Threat detection",""

It is important to understand the attack lifecycle because the psychology of an attack is driven by the ability to acquire the organization's information assets (i.e., 'crown jewels'). Attacks are usually orchestrated based upon where the assets are placed and around the defense and protection mechanisms put into place to protect and secure them. An understanding of the different phases of the attack and how perpetrators can either bypass or work through the defense mechanisms into environments best positions attackers for success. This view is often shaped by the goals and intent of the perpetrators for all attacks are not driven for financial gain. Some other goals of an attack may be based upon social, political, cultural and other objectives. For example, banks and other financial institutions are targeted for financial gain. The private and government sectors are targeted for intellectual property (IP). Individuals, communities, and organizations are targeted for the purpose of demonstrating vulnerability of an environment or the capability of the attacker. Many organizations, due to the extent to which they can be damaged if their information is compromised or stolen, are relying more heavily on outside security firms. The rationale seems very logical in that businesses whose focus is on security should be 'better equipped' to handle this responsibility for organizations. The problem is that, though firms have gotten much better at 'qualifying' their capabilities, the misconception that they can indeed protect and defend against all attacks on information assets still exists. The perpetrators, are increasingly becoming savvier, and better resourced and have significantly broadened their target base, as we have seen recently, to now target security firms. We see security firms, e.g., Lifelock (Lifelock to Settle Charges by the FTC and 35 States, 2010) and RSA (Anatomy of an Attack, 2011) under siege in an attempt to get access to the information assets. In many cases, the 'keys to the castle' held by the security firms provide access to huge assets of some companies, including some of the major Fortune 500 companies - a great incentive to attackers seeking financial gain. As we focus our attention on the attack vectors, it is important to be vigilant in our attention on the attack ecosystem. We find a dominating approach used by many that has produced limited benefits, at best. Recognizing an organization's vulnerability is the first step in a viable multi-step hacking recovery program. Unfortunately, the focus of most efforts to protect and defend information assets against perpetrators is concentrated in a phase within the attack lifecycle that actually goes counter to the realization that environments are likely to get hacked. We introduce a novel approach wherein for the first time, relevant individual technologies have been brought together under a single framework. We believe that the concatenating of the individual concepts in a way that has not been previously described is indeed a novel approach to addressing the problem.","Attack lifecycle; Cybersecurity; Deterrence; Information assets; Intrusion detection and intrusion prevention","Computer crime; Finance; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Personal computing; Societies and institutions; Cyber security; Deterrence; Financial institution; Individual concepts; Individual technology; Information assets; Intrusion prevention; Protection mechanisms; Life cycle"

Therefore, both service providers and clients should build an information security system and trust relationship with each other. In this research paper, we analysed most widely used international and industry standard (ISO/IEC 27001:2013) for information security to know its effectiveneb for Cloud Organizations, each control importance factor for on-premises, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, and identify the most suitable controls for the development of SLA based Information Security Metrics for each Cloud Service Model. We generically evaluated ibid standards control objectives without considering Cloud organization size, nature of work, enterprise size. To know effectiveneb, relevance to Cloud Computing, factor of standard control objectives for the in-house or in a public cloud, we defined a quantitative metric.

While people enjoy the convenience that IT offers, it also poses various security threats if not used properly, including malware, hacking, and information disclosure. Unfortunately, the scale and consequence of cyber threats has increased significantly year-on-year despite various security controls having been developed and deployed. It is evident that end users play a significant role within the information security domain, as they are frequently the primary target and the main force behind incidents. Nonetheless, whilst there are annual security surveys for organisations, less effort were given regarding assessing how individuals practice information security by the research community. Therefore, this paper presents a survey that investigates user's IT security practice and behaviour. In total, 400 respondents were surveyed during a five month period (i.e. November 2014 - March 2015). Overall, the results demonstrate that end users practice better IT security than typically thought although it appears only at a relatively basic level. For example, whilst a reasonably good proportion of participants (66%) claimed that they never share their passwords with others, 76% have used the same password on multiple sensitive accounts. Almost three quarters (72%) of responders never click on links or attachments within emails from unknown sources, but this is significantly reduced (to 36%) when someone they knew sent the email. Two-thirds of users (65%) do appreciate the importance of antivirus software as they always keep their antivirus software updated; however, less care is given to other applications/systems as only 44% would do the same and more alarmingly 65% even cancel or delay the security update process. Over two thirds (68%) of participants do not always backup their data, and only half of the participants (53%) claimed that they always destroy their data before hardware disposal. The results of the survey suggest that whilst levels of awareness are improving, there is still a significant gap between existing and required levels of information security knowledge and practice. Arguably, users are currently being overwhelmed by the burden being placed upon them to remain secure. The range of technologies they use (60% using more than 3 devices), the widespread use of online services (89% using at least 5 IT services) highlight users are becoming or have become technology dependent but perhaps without being security savvy.","End-user; IT security; Survey","Application programs; Authentication; Computer crime; Electronic mail; Malware; Personal computing; Security of data; Security systems; Surveying; Surveys; Antivirus softwares; End users; Information disclosure; IT security; On-line service; Research communities; Security controls; Security threats; Information use"

The growing use of cyber technology in safety intensive organizations has posed a challenge for those trying to understand the impacts cyber security risks have on safety. This knowledge gap slows progress towards InfoSec maturity and puts organizations and stakeholders at greater risk. For example, e-enabled aircraft now rely heavily on cyber resources, yet cyber security analysis in aviation usually focuses on CIA of information to prevent economic loss. What happens when a malicious attacker successfully exploits cyber aircraft vulnerabilities? This can potentially downgrade critical functions and result in injury or loss of life. To better understand the impacts of cyber risk on safety, the CIA information security triad should expand beyond its current focus to also consider safety.

Cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure networks causing an outage quickly escalate into the worst case scenario. Remote attackers can start an attack from all around the world. During the reconnaissance step, attackers need to gather information about the victim. One of the most important information in this regard is the IP address of the victim. Static IP addresses can help attackers in two aspects. First, they are easily discoverable. Second, after accessing the victim, the attacker can maintain this access for a long time. So an effective defense is a mechanism to change the IP addresses randomly and dynamically. By using Mobile IPv6 we can have both a permanent IP address to avoid disrupting TCP sessions and a temporary IP address for connecting to other nodes. Therefore, we developed a Moving Target Mobile IPv6 Defense (MTM6D) to dynamically change the IP address of critical infrastructure servers. The main goals of our method are using a combination of available standards to defend targeted attacks and eliminating packet loss because of address collision during address rotations. The feasibility and performance evaluation of MTM6D are demonstrated by real network implementation.","Critical infrastructure; Dynamic IP; Mobile IPv6; Moving target defense; Remote attacks","Computer crime; Internet protocols; Public works; Security of data; Dynamic ip; Industrial systems; Mobile IPv6; Moving target defense; Moving targets; Real networks; Remote attacks; Worst case scenario; Critical infrastructures"

As the data in the cyberspace continues to grow in a gargantuan manner due to the popularity and successes of Web 2.0 technologies and social networks, amongst other reasons, organizations also continue to face the complex challenge of sifting through this data to timely detect and respond to security threats relevant to their operating domain. Traditional businesses and governmental organisations generally rely on inefficient and discrete solutions that rely on limited sources of information, signature-based and anomaly-based approaches to detect known cyber threats and attacks. On the contrary, threat agents continue to develop advanced techniques for their cyber espionage, reconnaissance missions, and ultimately devastating attacks. In addition, emerging cybersecurity intelligence solutions lack the semantic knowledge essential for automated sharing of timely and context-aware information within a specific operating domain. Moreover, existing cybersecurity information sharing solutions lack the visualization and intelligence necessary for handling the large volume of unstructured data generated by multiple sources across different sectors. In an attempt to address some of these challenges, this paper presents a preposition of a semantic-enabled sharing model for exchanging timely and relevant cybersecurity intelligence with trusted collaborators. Drawing from previous research and open source sharing platforms, such as CRITS, this model is underpinned by common information exchange standards, such as STIX and TAXII. The proposed cross-platform sharing model is evaluated by exploiting a large stream of cybersecurity-related tweets and semantic knowledge available from a variety of data sources. Preliminary results suggest that semantic knowledge is essential towards enabling collaborative and automated exchange of timely and actionable cybersecurity intelligence.","Big data; Crowdsourcing; Cybersecurity; Threat intelligence; Vulnerabilities; Web security","Big data; Complex networks; Computer crime; Crowdsourcing; Data visualization; Knowledge management; Metadata; Semantics; Social sciences computing; Context-aware informations; Cyber security; Information exchanges; Reconnaissance mission; Sources of informations; Threat intelligence; Vulnerabilities; WEB security; Information dissemination"

Security is the inverse of risk, and we can measure risk by evaluating expected loss, which is the product of the probability that a bad event will occur by the damage such an event will cause if the event does occur. Thus, expected loss provides a way to indirectly measure security in information infrastructures. To determine the relevant probabilities, we use failure time analysis. This paper provides a performance-based metric that can be used to obtain a quantitative measure of the security of information infrastructures. The metric can be used to compare the security status of different information infrastructures, or to track the evolution of security within a single infrastructure.

Then, the computer network security is becoming more and more dangerous. Accurately and scientifically predict the risk of network, it can effectively prevent the risk, and reduce the loss caused by the problem of computer network security. Computer network security is an early warning problem of multi index system. So, the traditional linear forecasting method cannot accurately describe the impact of each index on the evaluation results, and the accuracy of the prediction results is low. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of computer network security, this paper presents a new forecasting method for computer network security. Firstly, the evaluation index of computer network security is selected by expert system, and the weight of evaluation index is determined by the expert scoring method. Secondly, we put the index weight into the BP neural network, and use the BP neural network to learn it. Then, the parameters of BP neural network are optimized by the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. After that, this paper uses a method based on the Fibonacci method principle to find the number of hidden layer node which has the best fitting ability. Finally, we use this algorithm to predict the network security of a certain enterprise in the next six months. The score is 0.67, 0.84, 0.72, 0.87, 0.86 and 0.91, which is close to the actual value of network security. © 2016 SERSC.","BP neural network; Fibonacci method; Network information security; Particle swarm optimization","Algorithms; Computer networks; Computer viruses; Expert systems; Forecasting; Malware; Neural networks; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Security of data; BP neural network model; BP neural networks; Destructive programs; Fibonacci method; Improved particle swarm optimization algorithms; Network information securities; Network technologies; Prediction accuracy; Network security"

Existing implementation methods such as GPP, FPGA and cryptographic application-specific ASIC provide the broad range of support. However, these methods could not achieve a good tradeoff between high-speed processing and flexibility. In this paper, we present a reconfigurable VLIW processor architecture targeted at block cipher processing, analyze basic operations and storage characteristics, and propose the multi-cluster register-file structure for block ciphers. As for the same operation element of block ciphers, we adopt reconfigurable technology for multiple cryptographic processing units and interconnection scheme. The proposed processor not only flexibly accomplishes the combination of multiple basic cryptographic operations, but also realizes dynamic configuration for cryptographic processing units. It has been implemented with 0.18μm CMOS technology, the test results show that the frequency can reach 350MHz, and power consumption is 420mw. Ten kinds of block and hash ciphers were realized in the processor. The encryption throughput of AES, DES, IDEA, and SHA-1 algorithm is 1554Mbps, 448Mbps, 785Mbps, and 424Mbps respectively, the test result shows that our processor's encryption performance is significantly higher than other designs. © 2013 IEEE.","application-specific instruction-set; Block Cipher; reconfigurable; VLIW processor",""

It aims at achieving efficient, sustainable, economic, and secure delivery of electricity supplies. In order to achieve these goals, communication between different components within the grid and control centers is required. In a rapidly growing world, the demands for substation automation are increasing. Recently, two trends have been changing Substation Automation Systems: IEC 61850 and the need for cybersecurity. IEC 61850 specifies very strict performance requirements for message transfer time. The security for the smart grid must be designed to satisfy both performance and reliability requirements. In this paper, we address a study about secure communication in the substation real-time environment, complying with the IEC 61850 specifications. We mainly focus on analyzing the proposed Secure TCP/IP profile for MMS, testing different cipher suite combinations and examining whether by applying TLS we can still achieve the strict performance requirements of IEC 61850 or not. As a result of the study, we propose a list of cipher suite combinations that should be used. The importance of this study lies mainly on future scenarios, because IEC 61850 is thought to support smart metering communications. © 2016 Omar Khaled et al.","","Automation; Electric power system protection; Electric power transmission networks; Electric substations; Enterprise resource planning; Transmission control protocol; Control center; Electricity supply; Message transfers; Performance and reliabilities; Performance requirements; Real-time environment; Substation automation; Substation Automation Systems; Smart power grids"

Employing an empirical study, this paper demonstrates the importance of perceived control in SNS users’ information-sharing behaviors. Specifically, perceived control has been found to be negatively related to perceived privacy risk and attitude toward information sharing, which in turn has an impact on their information-sharing behaviors. In addition, gender has been shown to be an important factor that moderates the influences of both perceived control and perceived privacy risk on SNS users’ attitudes toward information sharing.

Since then, the traditional process of purchasing software has dramatically changed, challenged by the advent of open source software (OSS). Since its inception in the 1980s, OSS has matured, grown, and become one of the important driving forces of the enterprise ecosystem. However, it has also brought important IT security risks that are impacting the OSS IT adoption decision-making process. The recent Heartbleed bug demonstrated the grandeur of the issue. While much of the noise relates to the amplification of perceived risks by the popular mass media coverage, the effect is that many enterprises, mainly for risk reasons, have still chosen not to adopt OSS. We investigated ""how do information security related characteristics of OSS affect the risk perception and adoption decision of OSS"" by conducting an online survey of 188 IT decision-makers. The proposed Open Source Risk Adoption Model offers novel insights on the importance of the perceived risk antecedents. Our research brings new theoretical contributions, such as understanding the perceived IT security risk (PISR) relationship with adoption intention (AI) in the OSS context, for researchers and important insights for IT information professionals. We have found that IT security risk has a significant role in OSS adoption intention. Our results offer possible future research directions and extend existing theoretical understanding of OSS adoption. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","information security; IT risks; open source software; organizational security; Risk factors",""

The approach is designed to provide very concrete decision support for an organization as a whole or separately for specific systems. It can be applied in practice without requiring the decision maker himself to collect extensive input data. This is accomplished by using an existing comprehensive and highly accepted knowledge base as a basis for decision making. For our analysis, we use the publicly available IT baseline protection catalogues of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). The catalogues contain more than 500 threats and over 1200 safeguard alternatives to choose from. Applying our model, it is possible to make use of this knowledge and determine optimal selections of safeguards according to given security requirements.

This paper empirically examines the relationship between online victimisation and users' activity and perceptions of personal information security on social networking services (SNS). Based on a survey of active users, we explore how behavioural patterns on social networks, personal characteristics and technical efficacy of users impact the risk of facing online victimisation. Our results suggest that users with high-risk propensity are more likely to become victims of cybercrime, whereas those with high perceptions of their ability to control information shared on SNS are less likely to become victims. The study shows that there is a negative and statistically significant association between multipurpose dominant SNS (e.g. Facebook, Google +) usage and victimisation. However, activity on the SNS for knowledge exchange (e.g. LinkedIn, Blogger) has a positive and statistically significant association with online victimisation. Our results have implications for practice as they inform the social media industry that protection of individual information security on SNS cannot be left entirely to the user. The importance of user awareness in the context of social technologies plays an important role in preventing victimisation, and social networking services should provide adequate controls to protect personal information. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cyber threats; Cybercrime victimisation; Information security; Personal information privacy; Social media; Social networking services","Behavioral research; Computer crime; Crime; Data privacy; Information dissemination; Knowledge management; Network security; Risk perception; Security of data; Social sciences computing; Cyber threats; Personal information; Social media; Social networking services; Victimisation; crime; information technology; Internet; security; social network; Social networking (online)"

Among them, double random phase encoding (DRPE) scheme is the oldest and most exhaustively explored optical scheme. However, symmetric nature and linearity prove to be bane of the DRPE scheme, and give an open invitation to unauthorized users to crack the system by mounting different type of attacks. Due to this fact, security of the DRPE scheme has been compromised, making the system vulnerable to attacks. A number of schemes have also been introduced based on the use of fractional Fourier-, Fresnel-, gyrator-, Hartley-, and other transforms. However, vulnerabilities are not limited only to the Fourier domain based systems. Fresnel- and fractional Fourier domain based systems have also been found weak against the chosen-, and the known-plaintext attacks. Resistance of many of the security enhanced DRPE schemes in some other linear canonical transform domains has also been found to be weak against these attacks or their modified forms. When linearity is claimed to be broken with introduction of an amplitude mask at the Fourier plane, the DPRE scheme is able to nullify the high level known-plaintext attack but susceptibility is found against a simple impulse function attack. Recently, some strategies have been adopted to improve the resistance of the DRPE based schemes against the impulse function attacks. Some aspects of the problem have been discussed in the present chapter. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","",""

Nowday’s e-learning’s popularity is increasing as more and more people are taking online courses. It becomes the need of the hour, since it is being used as a big platform for enhancing and upgrading knowledge by increasing flexibility in various fields and providing ways to make learning easier. However E-learning has several challenges, one of these major challenges is Information Security. The security aspect is even more important for controlling access to information resources intended to specific users depending on several predefined contexts. Defining such access control is directly related to the appliance of a control access policy, responsible of securing learning sessions in an e-learning platform. The purpose of this paper is to propose how to adapt ORBAC (organization role based access control) model which is considered as one of the most developed access control security models, to improve the highest degree of security in a concrete e-learning scenario for educational purpose, and to prove how the expressive power and flexibility of this model work.

A recent survey concluded that from 307 SMEs, only 15 indicated to have an ISS policy [1]. The conclusion drawn from that study was that the adoption of ISS policies has not become a reality yet. As an attempt to mitigate this fact, security policies were formulated, implemented and adopted in 10 SMEs which had stated not to have this security measure.

This problem, referred to as the node immunization problem, is the core building block in many high-impact applications, ranging from public health, cybersecurity to viral marketing. A central component in node immunization is to find the best k bridges of a given graph. In this setting, we typically want to determine the relative importance of a node (or a set of nodes) within the graph, for example, how valuable (as a bridge) a person or a group of persons is in a social network. First of all, we propose a novel 'bridging' score Δλ, inspired by immunology, and we show that its results agree with intuition for several realistic settings. Since the straightforward way to compute Δλ is computationally intractable, we then focus on the computational issues and propose a surprisingly efficient way (O(nk2+m) ) to estimate it. Experimental results on real graphs show that (1) the proposed 'bridging' score gives mining results consistent with intuition; and (2) the proposed fast solution is up to seven orders of magnitude faster than straightforward alternatives. © 2015 IEEE.","graph mining; Immunization; scalability","Algorithms; Computation theory; Computer viruses; Immunization; Scalability; Building blockes; Central component; Computational issues; Computer communication networks; Cyber security; Graph mining; Orders of magnitude; Viral marketing; Graph theory"

The purpose of this study is to identify important features in building an intrusion detection system such that they are computationally eficient and effective. To improve the performance of intrusion detection system, this paper proposes an intrusion detection system that its features are optimally selected using ant colony optimization.

In this way only the sender and recipient are aware of hidden information. There are two critical characteristics of steganography which are as stego image imperceptibility and payload capacity. Recently, many edge detection based steganogaphy approaches have been developed to provide high imperceptibility of the stego image. However, the capacity of these approaches can be limited. This paper presents an effective edge detection method based on gradient, 9x9 mask of LOG and zero crossing in combination with clustering to classify the image to edge and non-edge regions. Different amount of secret message will be hidden in each cluster after the detection of the edge regions. It declares the stability between stego image imperceptibility and high payload capacity. © 2016.","Clustering; Data hiding; Hyper edge detection","Aerodynamic loads; Dynamic loads; Edge detection; Security of data; Clustering; Data hiding; Edge detection methods; Hidden information; Hiding informations; Pay load capacity; Secret messages; Zero-crossings; Steganography"

Ethical hacking is one important information security risk management strategy they use. Most published books on ethical hacking have focused on its technical applications in risk assessment practices. This paper addressed a scarcity within the organizational communication literature on ethical hacking. Taking a qualitative exploratory case study approach, the authors explored ethical hacking implementation within a Canadian university as the case study in focus, applying technoethical inquiry theory paired with Karl Weick's sensemaking model as a theoretical framework. In-depth interviews with key stakeholder groups and a document review were conducted. Findings pointed to the need to expand the communicative and sociocultural considerations involved in decision making about ethical hacking organizational practices, and to security awareness training to leverage sensemaking opportunities and reduce equivocality.

However, high-volume real-time sensing data is more vulnerable in unmanned system than that in manned system. Meanwhile, the computation and energy resources in such system are very limited, which restricts the use of complex encryption process on video data. Therefore, how to achieve confidentiality of video data under limited resources efficiently needs to be addressed. Firstly, resources constraints with their development trends in video sensing system are studied. Secondly, an information-utility-value-oriented resource-efficient encryption optimization model under resources constraints is given. Thirdly, based on this model, a video-compression-independent speed-adjustable lightweight encryption scheme with its improved version is proposed. Fourthly, a DSP and ARM based embedded secure video sensing system is designed, and the proposed encryption scheme has been implemented in it.

Today most of the present application optimizations are based on Service Level Agreements which focuses on virtual machine (VM) based computing service, while other services such as storage and cache are often neglected. This paper mainly focuses on cache based approach for multi-tenant application on PaaS. Currently in multi-tenant cloud applications data are often evicted mistakenly by cache service, which is managed by existing algorithms such as LRU. It keeps the query information to reload the evicted data from storage which might be sensitive. Hence there is a possibility of data breach when these data are accessed improperly by other tenants. For faster access caching of the data is common in cloud based applications while the security is an important area that should not be neglected when these systems uses other third party systems/networks as caching servers. Also security of the tenant’s data/information is also a crucial component of the SLA between cloud service provider and tenant.

From this perspective, most recent botnets are HTTP based and/or Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. In this work, we investigate whether such structural differences have any impact on the performance of the botnet detection systems. To this end, we studied the differences of three machine learning techniques (Decision Tree, Genetic Programming and Bayesian Networks). The investigated approaches have been previously shown effective for HTTP based botnets. We also analyze the detection models in detail to highlight any behavioural differences between these two types of botnets. In our analysis, we employed four HTTP based publicly available botnet data sets (namely Citadel, Zeus, Conficker and Virut) and four P2P based publicly available botnet data sets (namely ISOT, NSIS, ZeroAccess and Kelihos). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Botnet detection; HTTP; Machine learning; P2P","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Decision trees; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Internet protocols; Learning systems; Malware; Peer to peer networks; Botnet detections; Cyber security; Detection models; Detection system; Legitimate users; Machine learning techniques; Peer-to-Peer system; Structural differences; HTTP"

The Beta-based Trust and Reputation Evaluation System (BTRES) is proposed in this paper for WSNs' node trust and reputation evaluation. BTRES is based on monitoring nodes' behavior, and beta distribution is used to describe the distribution of nodes' credibility. The node trust values are used to guide the selection of relay nodes, mitigating internal attacks risks. Simulation results show that the use of BTRES could effectively maximize the defense of internal attacks from compromised nodes and improve the WSNs' information security.

While this definition does not apply to a cyber context, cyber forces can still play a role in force projection. By studying the cases of the denial of services attack targeting Estonia in 2007, the Shamoon worm attack of 2012 and the Sony Pictures hack of 2014 as examples of power projection, it is possible to forecast future trends in cyber power projection. Notably, the case studies will show that it is possible to threaten both tangible and intangible assets with cyber attacks. In addition, the case studies will underline the importance of the credibility of the threat for the effectiveness of projection of power, which is influenced both by the perceived capability of the attacker and on the ability to sustain the damage. The case studies also highlight cyber as a means for nation states to project power far outside of their traditional scope, leveraging the loose attributability of cyber force projection for more freedom of action. Based on these observations, the aim of the paper is to anticipate the trajectory of future trends for cyber force projection. First, increased signalling of capabilities would be expected to strengthen the credibility of cyber threats. Second, continued improvement of the ability to apply and sustain cyber attacks is expected to continue due to the increased virtualization of assets of national interest and the increase in pathways for cyber mediated impacts on more traditional assets thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT).","Cyber conflict; Cyber strategy; Cyber warfare; Loose attributability; Power projection; Signalling","Crime; Cybersecurity; Internet of things; Network security; Case-studies; Cybe conflict; Cybe strategy; Cyber warfare; Cyber-attacks; Future trends; Loose attributability; Power; Power projection; Signaling; Denial-of-service attack"

We build upon a three layered architecture comprised of Security Operations Centres at organizational (O-SOC), national (N-SOC), and European (E-SOC) level using IDS and SIEM solutions. In our approach we combine machine learning and automatic ontological reasoning: First, we apply methods from the field of machine learning to analyse threat indicators of different granularity. This provides classification of very specific observables collected at compromised sites. Second, we perform ontological analysis to identify large scale correlations within an incident knowledge graph. This yields insight into ongoing attack campaigns, especially regarding extent and expected impact. Our approach further allows to identify targets that are likely also to be affected or already compromised. Our proposed architecture counters advanced threats targeted against the critical infrastructures of Europe. We currently develop a prototype of our approach within the framework of European Union FP7 project ECOSSIAN (607577).","Critical infrastructures; Machine learning; Ontological reasoning; Threat detection","Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Critical infrastructures; Cybersecurity; Learning systems; Ontology; Public works; Cyber-attacks; Defence technology; Different granularities; Layered architecture; Machine-learning; Ontological analysis; Ontological reasoning; Organisational; Security operation center; Threat detection; Network security"

However, as we focus our attention on the study of models and frameworks, we ignore one of the most important points for information security situation assessment which is data fusion. Even we have a mature model of how to organize these data, we still need an effective data fusion method to fuse them, and evaluate the information security situation according to the fuse result. Some researchers have conducted a series of studies on this, but their studies are more concerned about data fuse architecture rather than the method itself.

The changes in the structure and volume of transmitted information require that a rigorous procedure of safe transmission of information should be maintained by both the subjects of social relations, which have a personal interest in ensuring the maximum possible level of security for the transmitted data and the state as a whole as a guarantor of social relations’ legal stability. It is evident that national security greatly depends of ensuring information security, and that technological progress increases this dependence. Information, acting as economic and social guarantee of stable existence and development of the society and the state, is an object of close attention and influence from the state. The introduction of full-scale electronic documentation processing and the creation of inter-operational information resources made information rather vulnerable to external influence. The legal basis of information protection in international law includes the following components: basic privacy principles; the procedure of trans-border transmission of confidential information; protection of confidential information; status of international bodies working on developing a unified legal policy in the sphere of privacy and its implementation. Using the generalized analysis of both the international and the national legal bases, the existing views on this issues and the authors’ considerations, the paper presents a conceptually innovative approach to international cooperation in the sphere of counteracting cybercrimes, which presupposes a greater coordination of the actions of all states in at least two directions: the enhancement of the legal background of counteraction and the implementation of the devised norms into the national legislation, the improvement of the organizational basis of information exchange. © 2016, Baikal National University of Economics and Law.

Computer viruses and malware are a common aspect of today's landscape. To protect us and our data, laws that govern the protection of computer data were created and developed. Likewise, organizations and approaches for finding and addressing cyberattacks were established and grown. Education has supported this radically changing environment through the development of educational programs in industry and academia, including bachelor's and master's degree programs. SE education responded to the advancing technology, resulting in a new profession. SwA education responded to the failures of industry to develop quality software, including security challenges that arose as technology was used and exploited. © 2016 Elsevier Inc..","Computer security; Cybersecurity; Incident management; Internet; Software assurance; Software engineering; Structured programming; Supply chain risk management; Viruses",""

Simulation is an emerging field in testing and assessing cybersecurity risk as it allows modeling cyber systems, their interdependencies, and interactions between cyber systems and people who are using, policing, and even attacking these systems. With cybersecurity scenarios, we help describe and formulate these complex interdependencies and relationships. In this paper, we first characterize cybersecurity scenarios along (1) the nature of cyber systems with considerations for design and (2) the type of actor with considerations of abilities. This characterization provides a more clear distinction compared to military oriented LVC (Live-Virtual-Constructive) simulation characterization. We then review examples from the literature based on our characterization. According to our review, we note that cyber system representation has been widely explored while actor representation is often realized at the technical-level dismissing social and cognitive aspects. Thus, we believe that paying more attention to social and cognitive aspects of actor representation, especially as developing general-purpose tools, will benefit the modeling and simulation community. © 2016 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).","Actor representation; Cyber system representation; Cybersecurity; Simulation for cybersecurity","Network security; Actor representation; Cognitive aspects; Cyber security; Cyber systems; Cyber-attacks; Live-virtual-constructive; Model and simulation; Technical levels; Risk assessment"

As part of national critical infrastructure, this set of computing and network capabilities requires careful thought regarding cybersecurity as part of the overall system architecture and development. This paper provides a summary of current security engineering in the power system. Further, it addresses recent project developments from IBM on security of the electrical infrastructure. The real-Time and distributed nature of the power grid is unique in its breadth of potential security issues. Actions from the U.S. Federal Government, beginning in 1996 and more recently in 2012, to identify the energy industry as the most popular threat target and thus encourage appropriate security practices testify to the importance of grid security. The European Union has reacted similarly.

In business schools, this shift has presented the pedagogical challenge of balancing the technical content fundamental to information security with the managerial content that the profession increasingly values. To draw on the best practices currently being undertaken in the classroom, we examine 44 information security course syllabi from business and other schools (i.e., computer science, engineering, information science, law, and mathematics). Using a qualitative approach, we identify the definitive technical and managerial-focused aspects of information security courses.

The single encryption technique using one source is not adequate to accomplish the big data cloud computing security. This paper elaborates the working of cloud computing and the collaborating source security system for the Big Data security. A collaborating encryption technique framework is proposed in this paper to meet the futures' faster encryption requirements. The traditional information security system is not capable to provide the complete security during the cloud computing. The method described in this research comprises the parallel and distributed encryption system which gets the benefits the homomorphic encryption technique. The encryption facility during the mobile communication of object is tedious. Every cloud has its own security features and can be working in collaboration with the other cloud servers. Therefore, the parallel and distributed encryption facilities can be possible at every next door of other cloud without breaking the sequence of encryption process. The essential resources become the remote resources and the allocation of these resources can be managed at every cloud. Most of the time while working with the cloud computing is the availability of network and other resources. Providing the information security in the unavailability of resources during encryption and decryption is a difficult task. The collaboration encryption technique is a framework where, different clouds can work in parallel with the distributed processing. The security mechanism is improved by the homomorphic encryption.","Big data; Cloud computing; Collaborating encryption; Encrypted search",""

The cybercrime threat is reflected in the increased number of cases and methods used by criminals. Systems based on cloud computing are natural targets due to their complexity (greater room for security weaknesses) and increasing popularity. Cloud computing is a modern technology that enables users to share resources in a virtual storage and computing environment. A cloud system is based on multiple physical servers. It provides a universal environment with a (large) number of Virtual Machines (VMs) that is available to many users accessing this system via the Internet. This form of access makes cloud systems weaker than physical networks. In order to prevent or minimize the number of attacks and in turn to secure data storage, any malicious behaviour such as external undesirable interventions should be rapidly identified and halted if possible. In this paper, we focus on the discovery of malicious behaviour via determining unwanted symptoms rather than via targeting particular malicious behaviours of the system directly. The main contribution of this paper consists in several new mechanisms for monitoring Virtual Machines and further experimental work targeting efficient ways of visiting VMs in order to discover malicious symptoms. We want to find the fastest and the best set of weights for visiting VMs.","Cloud computing; Cloud monitoring; Malicious behaviour; Network patrolling; Virtual Machines","Cloud storage; Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Network security; Cloud monitoring; Cloud systems; Cloud-computing; Cyber-crimes; Internet users; Malicious behavior; Natural targets; Network patrolling; Rapid growth; Security weakness; Virtual machine"

Information warfare, i.e. propaganda, information sabotage, blackmail, could be more damaging than the effects of the traditional methods of war. The government must be prepared to prevent and counteract the bleeding-edge techniques of warfare that is to work out measures, to oppose enemy’s information weapons, to gain information superiority, to develop a society that is immune to disinformation, to elaborate a concept of information warfare counteraction. The authors have examined both foreign and Russian sources of law which define the requirements for the government activities to oppose information warfare. They also refer to the opinions of foreign and Russian researchers, politicians and public figures who have commented on the concept and features of such political and legal constructs as information warfare and information weapons. The problem of information warfare must be identified as a profoundly serious and damaging threat. This paper provides the features of information warfare and the methods to resist it as well as the proposals to amend the domestic legislation to create conditions for an accurate understanding of this political and legal phenomenon. In addition, it points out that the amendment of the Information Security Doctrine is not sufficient to counterbalance the threat of information warfare.

However, these credentials do not always ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and traceability (CIAT) of systems and e-services since they can be compromised due to many factors, which are beyond the control of administrators. Unauthorised access to G2B, G2C and G2G e-services can lead to very serious ramifications including compromise of citizens' privacy and threat to national security. The advent of cloud computing and mobility brings additional challenges and increased risk to CIAT due to the dynamics of user behaviour in an environment characterized by ubiquitous access to e-services by devices and users in the cyberspace. Existing solutions implement adaptive risk management on the basis of environment attributes mostly while those which additionally use factors such as CIA, are still at an abstract definition level. This paper proposes an alternative adaptive risk-based access control (ARBAC-RF) system, which uses risk factors and successfully demonstrates its implementation. This new method (ARBAC-RF) is risk adaptive and dynamically configurable using environment attributes and factors surrounding an e-Government context. Further, the ARBAC-RF uses heuristics and weighted multi-factor evaluation in order to make an access decision for both authentication and authorization. © The Authors, 2016.","E-government; Information security; National safety; Risk adaptive access control","Adaptive control systems; Authentication; Behavioral research; Government data processing; National security; Risk management; Security of data; Ubiquitous computing; Access decision; Adaptive risk management; Authentication and authorization; E-governments; Multi factors; National safety; Ubiquitous access; User behaviour; Access control"
