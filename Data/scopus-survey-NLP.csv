The convergence of information technology (IT) and OT systems has increased the attack surface and complexity of security threats in OT environments. As a result, proactive threat hunting has become critical in identifying and mitigating potential security breaches. Threat hunting in OT systems involves the continuous monitoring and analysis of network traffic and system logs to identify and isolate threats before they can cause significant damage. This approach allows security teams to identify malicious activity that traditional security measures may not detect, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) and zero-day exploits. Effective threat hunting requires specialized skills and expertise to navigate the unique challenges of OT environments, including limited resources, outdated technology, and a lack of standardization. It also involves collaboration between IT and OT teams to ensure comprehensive coverage of the attack surface. Threat hunting in OT systems is an ongoing process that requires a proactive approach to security. This paper presents a survey of threat hunting practices and methodologies in operational technology (OT) systems, this involves implementing continuous monitoring, conducting regular security assessments, and leveraging the latest threat intelligence to identify and mitigate emerging threats. By adopting a proactive and collaborative approach to threat hunting, organizations can protect their critical infrastructure systems and ensure the continuity of essential services.  © 2023 IEEE.","Industrial Control System (ICS); MITRE ATT/CK; Threat Hunting; Vulnerabilities","Cybersecurity; Intelligent control; Continuous monitoring; Cyber threats; Industrial control system; Industrial control systems; MITRE ATT/CK; Operational technologies; Pro-active approach; Technology system; Threat hunting; Vulnerability; Zero-day attack"

With the increasing reliance on technology in transportation systems, the risk of cyber-attacks and data breaches increases, making IDS an important aspect of ITS security. IDS systems monitor network traffic and detect any suspicious or malicious activity. In the context of ITS, IDS can detect unauthorized access to transportation systems, unauthorized changes to data or configurations, and other types of security incidents. This information can then be used to alert security personnel and prevent potential threats from causing damage. Reinforcement Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (RL-IDS) have gained increasing attention in recent years as means of improving the performance of traditional intrusion detection systems. RL-IDS uses reinforcement learning algorithms to train an agent to detect intrusions by maximizing a reward signal. In this survey, we give an overview of the traditional intrusion detection systems, their limitations, and how reinforcement learning overcomes these challenges to build more robust IDS. Next, we explore state-of-the-art research in RL-IDS for smart cities. Finally, we provide insights into future directions for research in RL-IDS for smart cities and highlight the potential benefits of these systems for enhancing the security of these environments.  © 2023 IEEE.","Intrusion Detection Systems; Reinforcement-Learning; Smart Cities; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Drones; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network security; Smart city; Aerial vehicle; Cyber-attacks; Intelligent transportation systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network traffic; Reinforcement learnings; System security; Systems monitor; Transportation system; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Reinforcement learning"

In spite of the increasing number of possible applications of ML, successful adoption of ML models in cybersecurity still highly relies on the explainability of those models that are used for making predictions. Explanations that support ML model outputs are crucial in cybersecurity-oriented ML applications because people need to get more information from the model than just binary output for analysis. The explainable models help ML developers solve the “trust” problem for a security application prediction in a faithful way: validating model behaviours, diagnosing misclassifications and sometimes automatically patching errors in the target models. Therefore, explainable ML for cybersecurity has become a necessary and important research branch. In this paper, we present the topic of explainable ML in cybersecurity through two general types of explanations: (1) ante hoc explanation, and (2) post hoc explanation, with their methodologies. We systematically review and categorise the state-of-the-art research, and provide comparative studies to help researchers find the optimal solutions to specific problems. We further list open issues in this field to facilitate future studies.

DL demands a large amount of data to achieve exceptional performance. Unfortunately, many applications have small or inadequate data to train DL frameworks. Usually, manual labeling is needed to provide labeled data, which typically involves human annotators with a vast background of knowledge. This annotation process is costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. Usually, every DL framework is fed by a significant amount of labeled data to automatically learn representations. Ultimately, a larger amount of data would generate a better DL model and its performance is also application dependent. This issue is the main barrier for many applications dismissing the use of DL. Having sufficient data is the first step toward any successful and trustworthy DL application. This paper presents a holistic survey on state-of-the-art techniques to deal with training DL models to overcome three challenges including small, imbalanced datasets, and lack of generalization. This survey starts by listing the learning techniques. Next, the types of DL architectures are introduced. After that, state-of-the-art solutions to address the issue of lack of training data are listed, such as Transfer Learning (TL), Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Model Architecture (MA), Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), and Deep Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (DeepSMOTE). Then, these solutions were followed by some related tips about data acquisition needed prior to training purposes, as well as recommendations for ensuring the trustworthiness of the training dataset. The survey ends with a list of applications that suffer from data scarcity, several alternatives are proposed in order to generate more data in each application including Electromagnetic Imaging (EMI), Civil Structural Health Monitoring, Medical imaging, Meteorology, Wireless Communications, Fluid Mechanics, Microelectromechanical system, and Cybersecurity. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review that offers a comprehensive overview on strategies to tackle data scarcity in DL. © 2023, Crown.","Civil structural health monitoring; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Cybersecurity; Data scarcity; Deep learning; Deep neural network architectures; DeepSMOTE; Electromagnetic imaging; Fluid mechanics; Generative Adversarial Networks; Lack of training data; Machine learning; Medical image analysis; Meteorology; PINN; Small datasets; SMOTE; Transfer learning; Trustworthy data; Wireless communications",""

In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of the current state-of-the-art of AI in railway transport. In particular, we analysed and discussed papers from a holistic railway perspective, covering sub-domains such as maintenance and inspection, planning and management, safety and security, autonomous driving and control, revenue management, transport policy, and passenger mobility. This review makes an initial step towards shaping the role of AI in future railways and provides a summary of the current focuses of AI research connected to rail transport. We reviewed about 139 scientific papers covering the period from 2010 to December 2020. We found that the major research efforts have been put in AI for rail maintenance and inspection, while very limited or no research has been found on AI for rail transport policy and revenue management. The remaining sub-domains received mild to moderate attention. AI applications are promising and tend to act as a game-changer in tackling multiple railway challenges. However, at the moment, AI research in railways is still mostly at its early stages. Future research can be expected towards developing advanced combined AI applications (e.g. with optimization), using AI in decision making, dealing with uncertainty and tackling newly rising cybersecurity challenges. © 2022 The Author(s)","Artificial Intelligence; Autonomous driving; Machine Learning; Maintenance; Railways; Smart mobility; Traffic management; Train control; Transportation","Autonomous vehicles; Decision making; Machine learning; Maintenance; Railroad transportation; Rails; 'current; Autonomous driving; Machine-learning; Maintenance and inspections; Revenue management; Smart mobility; Subdomain; Traffic management; Trains control; Transport policy; artificial intelligence; decision making; future prospect; holistic approach; literature review; railway transport; technology adoption; traffic management; transportation planning; transportation policy; transportation technology; Railroads"

Cybersecurity researchers and vendors are powering the CTI with large volumes of unstructured textual data containing information on threat events, threat techniques, and tactics. Hence, extracting cyberthreat-relevant information through text mining is an effective way to obtain actionable CTI to thwart cyberattacks. The goal of this research is to aid cybersecurity researchers understand the source, purpose, and approaches for mining cyberthreat intelligence from unstructured text through a literature review of peer-reviewed studies on this topic. We perform a literature review to identify and analyze existing research on mining CTI. By using search queries in the bibliographic databases, 28,484 articles are found. From those, 38 studies are identified through the filtering criteria which include removing duplicates, non-English, non-peer-reviewed articles, and articles not about mining CTI. We find that the most prominent sources of unstructured threat data are the threat reports, Twitter feeds, and posts from hackers and security experts. We also observe that security researchers mined CTI from unstructured sources to extract Indicator of Compromise (IoC), threat-related topic, and event detection. Finally, natural language processing (NLP) based approaches: topic classification; keyword identification; and semantic relationship extraction among the keywords are mostly availed in the selected studies to mine CTI information from unstructured threat sources. © 2020 IEEE.","Literature Review, Cyber threat intelligence","Classification (of information); Information services; Natural language processing systems; Personal computing; Security of data; Semantics; Bibliographic database; Defense mechanism; Filtering criteria; Literature reviews; NAtural language processing; Semantic relationships; Topic Classification; Unstructured texts; Text mining"

Deep learning, in particular, has been extensively used to drive applications and services in specializations such as computer vision, natural language processing, machine translation, and cybersecurity, producing results that are comparable to or even surpass the performance of human experts. Nevertheless, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially in nonstationary environments where actual adversaries exist, such as the cybersecurity domain. In this work, we comprehensively survey and present the latest research on attacks based on adversarial examples against deep learning-based cybersecurity systems, highlighting the risks they pose and promoting efficient countermeasures. To that end, adversarial attack methods are first categorized according to where they occur and the attacker's goals and capabilities. Then, specific attacks based on adversarial examples and the respective defensive methods are reviewed in detail within the framework of eight principal cybersecurity application categories. Finally, the main trends in recent research are outlined, and the impact of recent advancements in adversarial machine learning is explored to provide guidelines and directions for future research in cybersecurity. In summary, this work is the first to systematically analyze adversarial example-based attacks in the cybersecurity field, discuss possible defenses, and highlight promising directions for future research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Adversarial examples; Adversarial machine learning; Cyber threats; Cybersecurity; Deep learning","Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Adversarial example; Adversarial machine learning; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Deep learning; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Processing machines; Specialisation; Cybersecurity"

It follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. This research identifies the gaps in Islamic FinTech, which require further studies. Moreover, it highlights the issues raised during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: This study is based on the FinTech business model (BM) classifications by Lee & Shin and Imerman & Fabozzi. Furthermore, the set of challenges used in this study are adopted from research by Lee & Shin and Li & Xu. The Scopus database was used to collect data using nine keywords. Articles and review papers published between 2016 and 2022 were included. Studies that were not published in English, and those with no ranking journals were excluded. The results were presented using bibliometric analysis. Results: The results showed 36 articles discussing Islamic FinTech business trends and challenges, and most of these studies are conducted on FinTech crowdfunding vertical BM. By contrast, the most dominant horizontal BMs are FinTech regulation and FinTech funding BMs. The top challenge found in this study is the regulation management challenges. Moreover, there are remarkable dominating articles and reviews published in 2020 and 2021 discussing COVID-19. Conclusions: This study concluded that many horizontal BMs were not covered in Islamic FinTech, especially horizontal technology BMs. Investment, property and insurance BMs are examples of unavailable articles. Islamic FinTech is considered a promising field due to the size of the opportunities it presents, the available capital, and the great demand for banking and financial products that comply with the Sharia. This study will help the Islamic FinTech industry grow and predict the demand, and provide an alternative to conventional banking FinTech and further boost the technology progress in the financial industry. © 2022 Dawood H et al.","Business trends; Challenges; I-FinTech; Islamic FinTech; Systematic review","bibliometrics; commercial phenomena; coronavirus disease 2019; customer management challenge; finance; financial management; FinTech artificial intelligence business model; FinTech big data analytics business model; FinTech biometric business model; FinTech blockchain business model; FinTech capital market business model; FinTech cloud computing business model; FinTech crowdfunding business model; FinTech cybersecurity business model; FinTech digital banking neo banking business model; FinTech funding business model; FinTech insurance business model; FinTech internet of things business model; FinTech lending business model; FinTech open APIs business model; FinTech payment business model; FinTech property business model; FinTech quantum computing business model; FinTech regulation business model; FinTech risk management business model; FinTech robotics automation business model; FinTech valuation business model; FinTech virtual augmented reality business model; FinTech wealth management business model; human; impact of big data challenge; impact of COVID 19 challenge; investment management challenge; Islamic financial technology; model; pandemic; regulation management challenge; Review; risk management challenge; systematic review; technology; technology integration challenge; trend study"

This research fills the literature gap by analyzing the feedback from 114 open-ended surveys across five cybersecurity and digital forensic courses to categorize areas of course improvement. To gain insights into the qualitative survey feedback, we employed term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) with a K-Means clustering algorithm on cleaned and pre-processed survey data. This methodology provides more useful insights for curriculum developers than a standard sentiment analysis. The methodology can be further extended to be directly integrated into continual course improvement (e.g. ABET, NSA, DoD, etc.) indicators. © 2020 IEEE.","ABET; content-classification; continual course improvement; course benefits; course improvements; course obstacles; course surveys; cybersecurity; digital forensics; DoD; machine learning; natural language processing (NLP); NSA; qualitative analysis","Accreditation; Digital forensics; Electronic crime countermeasures; Forensic engineering; Inverse problems; K-means clustering; Machine learning; Security of data; Sentiment analysis; Students; Surveys; Accreditation board for engineering and technologies; Cyber security; Qualitative surveys; Regulatory requirements; Student feedback; Student surveys; Term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF); Through the lens; E-learning"

However, with the evolving cyber threat landscape, IoT devices have become more vulnerable to the broader risk surface (e.g., risks associated with generative AI, 5G-IoT, etc.), which, if exploited, may lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and lack of command and control and potential harm. This paper reviews the fundamentals of healthcare IoT, its privacy, and data security challenges associated with machine learning and H-IoT devices. The paper further emphasizes the importance of monitoring healthcare IoT layers such as perception, network, cloud, and application. Detecting and responding to anomalies involves various cyber-attacks and protocols such as Wi-Fi 6, Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa, and 5G New Radio (5G NR). A robust authentication mechanism based on machine learning and deep learning techniques is required to protect and mitigate H-IoT devices from increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Phishing attacks are now most often carried out by email. To better comprehend the existing research trend of phishing email detection, several review studies have been performed. However, it is important to assess this issue from different perspectives. None of the surveys have ever comprehensively studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for detection of phishing except one that shed light on the use of NLP techniques for classification and training purposes, while exploring a few alternatives. To bridge the gap, this study aims to systematically review and synthesise research on the use of NLP for detecting phishing emails. Based on specific predefined criteria, a total of 100 research articles published between 2006 and 2022 were identified and analysed. We study the key research areas in phishing email detection using NLP, machine learning algorithms used in phishing detection email, text features in phishing emails, datasets and resources that have been used in phishing emails, and the evaluation criteria. The findings include that the main research area in phishing detection studies is feature extraction and selection, followed by methods for classifying and optimizing the detection of phishing emails. Amongst the range of classification algorithms, support vector machines (SVMs) are heavily utilised for detecting phishing emails. The most frequently used NLP techniques are found to be TF-IDF and word embeddings. Furthermore, the most commonly used datasets for benchmarking phishing email detection methods is the Nazario phishing corpus. Also, Python is the most commonly used one for phishing email detection. It is expected that the findings of this paper can be helpful for the scientific community, especially in the field of NLP application in cybersecurity problems. This survey also is unique in the sense that it relates works to their openly available tools and resources. The analysis of the presented works revealed that not much work had been performed on Arabic language phishing emails using NLP techniques. Therefore, many open issues are associated with Arabic phishing email detection.  © 2013 IEEE.","machine learning; natural language processing; Phishing email detection; systematic literature review","Computer crime; E-learning; Electronic mail; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Support vector machines; Surveys; Email Detection; Features extraction; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Phishing; Phishing email detection; Systematic literature review; Feature extraction"

In the last years, the number of cyberattacks has grown dramatically, as well as their complexity. Traditional cybersecurity systems have failed to detect complex attacks, unknown malware, and they do not guarantee the preservation of user privacy. Consequently, cybersecurity systems have embraced Deep Learning (DL) models as they provide efficient detection of novel attacks and better accuracy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent cybersecurity works that use DL in mobile and wireless networks. It covers all cybersecurity aspects: infrastructure threads and attacks, software attacks and privacy preservation. First, we provide a detailed overview of DL techniques applied, or with potential applications, to cybersecurity. Then, we review cybersecurity works based on DL. For each cybersecurity threat or attack, we discuss the challenges for using DL methods. For each contribution, we review the implementation details and the performance of the solution. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the first survey that provides a complete review of the DL methods for cybersecurity. Given the analysis performed, we identify the most effective DL methods for the different threats and attacks.  © 2021 IEEE.","Cyberattacks; Deep learning; Machine learning; Mobile networking; Privacy; Security; Wireless networking","Complex networks; Learning systems; Malware; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Privacy by design; Surveys; Wireless networks; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Efficient detection; Learning techniques; Mobile service; Privacy preservation; Software attacks; Threats and attacks; Deep learning"

IoT security is facing significant threats from malicious code, necessitating comprehensive research on IoT malware detection techniques. Following the remarkable achievements of artificial intelligence (AI) in fields such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), the IoT security field has witnessed numerous efforts in AI-based malware detection as well. By reviewing relevant research findings and considering the characteristics of IoT environments and devices, we propose a classification method for the primary motivations behind research in this field and analyze the research development in IoT malware detection from two perspectives: malware detection techniques towards IoT device limitation mitigation and IoT malware detection techniques towards performance improvement. This classification method encompasses the relevant research in IoT malware detection, which also highlights the unique characteristics of IoT devices and the current limitations of the IoT malware detection field.

However, sharing the same fundamental limitation with other DL application domains, such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), AI-based cybersecurity solutions are incapable of justifying the results (ranging from detection and prediction to reasoning and decision-making) and making them understandable to humans. Consequently, explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a paramount topic addressing the related challenges of making AI models explainable or interpretable to human users. It is particularly relevant in cybersecurity domain, in that XAI may allow security operators, who are overwhelmed with tens of thousands of security alerts per day (most of which are false positives), to better assess the potential threats and reduce alert fatigue. We conduct an extensive literature review on the intersection between XAI and cybersecurity. Particularly, we investigate the existing literature from two perspectives: the applications of XAI to cybersecurity (e.g., intrusion detection, malware classification), and the security of XAI (e.g., attacks on XAI pipelines, potential countermeasures). We characterize the security of XAI with several security properties that have been discussed in the literature. We also formulate open questions that are either unanswered or insufficiently addressed in the literature, and discuss future directions of research. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cybersecurity; Explainable AI; Machine learning","Decision making; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Malware; Natural language processing systems; Android malware; Applications domains; Artificial intelligence learning; Cyber security; Explainable artificial intelligence; Fundamental limitations; Literature survey; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Source codes; Cybersecurity"

Due to the nested non-linear structure of deep learning algorithms, these highly successful models are usually applied in a black-box manner, i.e., no information is provided about what exactly causes them to arrive at their predictions. The effectiveness of these systems is thus limited by the machine’s current inability to explain its decisions and actions to human users. Such a lack of transparency can be a major drawback. For instance, in medical applications the development of methods for visualizing, explaining, and interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted increasing attention. Explainable Machine Learning (XAI) or Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) programs aim to create a suite of machine learning techniques that produce more explainable models while maintaining the high level of accuracy. It also enables human users to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners. Our work summarizes recent developments in this field, and we present three classification tasks wherein we make use of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to explain predictions of deep learning models. LIME attempts to make these complex models at least partly understandable by evaluating using three classification tasks.

While technological advancement in wireless networks offers numerous advantages, it also presents challenges like securing wireless networks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is well-known for detecting and preventing various security threats in such a network environment.

HIDS is widely adopted in the industry as HIDS is ranked among the top two most used security tools by Security Operation Centers (SOC) of organizations. Although effective and efficient HIDS is highly desirable for industrial organizations, the evolution of increasingly complex attack patterns causes several challenges resulting in performance degradation of HIDS (e.g., high false alert rate creating alert fatigue for SOC staff). Since Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods are better suited for identifying complex attack patterns, an increasing number of HIDS are leveraging the advances in NLP that have shown effective and efficient performance in precisely detecting low footprint, zero-day attacks and predicting an attacker's next steps. This active research trend of using NLP in HIDS demands a synthesized and comprehensive body of knowledge of NLP-based HIDS. Despite the drastically growing adoption of NLP in HIDS development, there has been relatively little effort allocated to systematically analyze and synthesize the available peer review literature to understand how NLP is used in HIDS development. The lack of a synthesized and comprehensive body of knowledge on such an important topic motivated us to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the papers on the end-to-end pipeline of the use of NLP in HIDS development. For the end-to-end NLP-based HIDS development pipeline, we identify, taxonomically categorize and systematically compare the state-of-the-art of NLP methods usage in HIDS, attacks detected by these NLP methods, datasets and evaluation metrics which are used to evaluate the NLP-based HIDS. We highlight the relevant prevalent practices, considerations, advantages and limitations to support the HIDS developers.

Recent cyber threat defense reports states that 80.7% of the systems are compromised at least once in 2020. Cyber criminals taking the pandemic situation as an opportunity for the mass attack through malicious URL circulated by email or text messages in social media. Performing cyber-attacks through malicious URLs is the handy method for the cyber criminals. Protecting from such attacks requires proper awareness and solid defense system. Some of the common approaches followed by the cybercriminals to deceive the victims are 1. Phishing URLs which is very similar to the legitimate URLs. 2. Redirecting URLs 3. Using JavaScript, redirects to the phishing URL when user interacts with webpage 4. Social engineering etc. As soon as the novice internet users clicks on the malicious URL link, cyber criminals can easily steal personal information or install malware on their device to get additional access. Recently malicious URLs are generated algorithmically and uses URL shortening service to evade the existing security setup such as firewall and web filters. In literature, the researchers have proposed several ways to detect the malicious URLs but, new attack vectors that are introduced by the cyber criminals can easily bypass the security system. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of various malicious URL detection techniques which includes blacklist based, rules based, machine learning and deep learning-based techniques. Most importantly, the paper discusses the common features used by the detection system from webpages to classify the URL as malicious or benign and various performance metrics.

Businesses uses web as a low-cost communication channel for their business promotion and communications. As a result, millions of domains are created and registered every day. This immense development allows cyber criminals to play as well. Cybercriminals use a variety of methods to exploit the web security. Recent cyber security reports states that security breaches are 17% higher in 2021 than in 2020. Cybercriminals use URLs (domain name) as an easy tool to carry out malicious activities. Through email, SMS, and social media sites like Face book and Twitter, malicious URLs are disseminated. As soon as victims click on the URL, fraudsters will steal their personal data or place malware on their computer to get access to other systems. It is very important to detect such malicious domain names in advance using AI based techniques. Researchers have proposed several methods to classify malicious domain names and malicious domain names. Recently they preferred to use machine learning and deep learning techniques for automated classification. This paper presents a recent research work in this field and research issues. This will serve as source of new research in this domain. © 2022 IEEE.","CNN; Cyber Security; Deep Learning; Domain names; Machine Learning; Malicious URL; RNN; Web Security","Costs; Deep learning; Learning systems; Malware; Social networking (online); Cyber security; Cybercriminals; Cyberspaces; Deep learning; Domain names; Global informations; Machine-learning; Malicious URL; RNN; WEB security; Cybersecurity"

Social media is one of the most powerful forces available to modern generation so, the ability of man to freely communicate his opinions on the internet cannot be ignored. The majority of people in our world are still unaware that social media is now considered to be not just something that adults use but also something that youngsters and kids must use. The information must then be screened to ensure that it doesn’t negatively affect human cognition in any manner and to make the internet a safer place for everyone. People disseminate inaccurate information or inappropriate content to attract fans on various sites; they disseminate damaging information or improper material, such as violent photographs and videos, irrelevant or abusive material, sexual content, cyberbullying, etc. There are several methods available, some of which have been detailed below, to detect this hazardous material. Through several databases, information from earlier work in this field has been gathered to know the prior studies concerning this notion. Numerous techniques, including deep learning and machine learning algorithms, have been chosen as the finest alternatives. This chapter gives a review on the existing methods and the management’s tool on the kid’s cyber security and one may learn from this Chapter how to improve knowledge acquisition in the digital age. Finally, this Chapter examines the challenges that come up while endeavoring to detect the harmful information that has been affecting kids’ minds. And it would be helpful regarding the main concept of algorithm involved in content analysis in addition; this chapter will be beneficial to many researchers in area on kids’ cyber security. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Artificial intelligence; Content classification; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Harmful information; Machine learning; Social networking management; Social networks",""

Advanced persistence threats use continuous, clandestine, and sophisticated techniques to gain access to a system and remain hidden for a prolonged period of time, with potentially destructive consequences. Those stealthy attacks are often not detectable by advanced intrusion detection systems (e.g., LightBasin attack was detected in 2022 and has been active since 2016). Indeed, threat actors are able to quickly and intelligently alter their tactics to avoid being detected by security defense lines (e.g., prevention and detection mechanisms). In response to these evolving threats, organizations need to adopt new proactive defense approaches. Threat hunting is a proactive security line exercised to uncover stealthy attacks, malicious activities, and suspicious entities that could circumvent standard detection mechanisms. Additionally, threat hunting is an iterative approach to generate and revise threat hypotheses endeavoring to provide early attack detection in a proactive way. The proactiveness consists of testing and validating the initial hypothesis using various manual and automated tools/techniques with the objective of confirming/refuting the existence of an attack. This survey studies the threat hunting concept and provides a comprehensive review of the existing solutions for Enterprise networks. In particular, we provide a threat hunting taxonomy based on the used technique and a sub-classification based on the detailed approach. Furthermore, we discuss the existing standardization efforts. Finally, we provide a qualitative discussion on current advances and identify various research gaps and challenges that may be considered by the research community to design concrete and efficient threat hunting solutions.  © ; 2023 IEEE.","cyber threat intelligence; Cybersecurity; threat detection; threat hunting","Intrusion detection; Iterative methods; Metadata; Network security; Cybe threat intelligence; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Enterprise networks; Security; Systematic; Threat detection; Threat hunting; Threat modeling; Tutorial; Cybersecurity"

At its core, the concept of ontology provides the means to semantically describe and structure information, and expose it to software and human agents in a machine and human-readable form. For software agents to be realized, it is crucial to develop powerful artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques, able to extract knowledge from information sources, and represent it in the underlying ontology. This survey aims to provide insight into key aspects of ontology-based knowledge extraction from various sources such as text, databases, and human expertise, realized in the realm of feature selection. First, common classification and feature selection algorithms are presented. Then, selected approaches, which utilize ontologies to represent features and perform feature selection and classification, are described. The selective and representative approaches span diverse application domains, such as document classifi-cation, opinion mining, manufacturing, recommendation systems, urban management, information security systems, and demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of such methods. This survey, in addition to the criteria-based presentation of related works, contributes a number of open issues and challenges related to this still active research topic. © 2021 by the authors.
