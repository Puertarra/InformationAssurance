Both of these infrastructure systems evolved over time as networks-of-networks in an institutionally fragmented landscape. In understanding and steering the emergent behaviour of these infrastructure systems both their physical network complexity and their social network complexity pose a formidable challenge. On top of the socio-technical complexity of the electricity infrastructure and the information and telecommunication infrastructure as such, the two infrastructure systems show unprecedented mutual interdependency. Unravelling this multi-level interdependency and identifying strategies to curb the new risks and vulnerabilities it implies for the reliability of electric power services is the goal of this book. It clearly shows that technical solutions alone will not suffice to ensure the future reliability and security of electricity infrastructure operations. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2010.","Cybersecurity; Infrastructure dependencies; Infrastructure vulnerability; Power systems",""

Collectively, the chapters have covered many relevant areas in biosecurity. The result is comprehensive, but not necessarily encyclopedic. While we have attempted to be complete, some subjects could not be comprehensively explored, and others have undoubtedly been omitted. The topics covered are complex, and at times contentious. For example, definitions of many terms, such as “preparedness, "" “terrorism, "" “all-hazards, "" and “first responder” are often ambiguous, being defined differently by many groups. Thus we have tried, when possible, to avoid them. Even the CDC categorization of biothreat agents into their specific A, B, and C categories may be very misleading as the technology to weaponize advances (which we in the scientific, medical, policy, and emergency response communities understand poorly). These ideas are viewed through a Western “in the box” way of thinking. Our adversaries think in very different ways and the cultural understanding of these differences is essential. A key goal of this book is to emphasize the need for global resilience and cooperation in preparedness, prevention, response and intelligence. Intelligence, for example, has to be co-produced and easily shared among the parties that need it when making decisions to protect our operations during all phases: pre-, trans-, and post-event. Intelligence for biosecurity then becomes a tool for better anticipating and understanding the dynamics of the threat and response spectrum. In addition to FININT, SIGINT, and HUMINT, different types of intelligence, such as threat, criminal, counterproliferation, and epidemiological intelligence are needed to craft a situational understanding of global biosecurity. Crafting responses to large-scale bioevents requires tools and approaches that help all decision makers navigate uncertainty. Intelligence is one essential tool for helping physicians, all responders, and government officials manage the potential consequences of bioterrorism, pandemics, and other crises. While intelligence is not a perfect science, it is an essential integrating component of an effective global security regime. Good intelligence informs decision making, enables early warning of disease and conflict, and provides situational understanding to formulate a viable response. But integrating intelligence networks will require a shift from a limited “need to know” approach to a broad “need to share” approach. Cooperation, coproduction, and collaboration among and across spatial and disciplinary divides are therefore essential elements of the biosecurity equation. The role of technology - both information and biotechnology - cannot be overstated. New product development is rapidly proliferating both geographically and technologically. This includes Professor Scott Layne’s high throughput laboratory to analyze thousands of specimens per day being developed at Los Alamos Labs and UCLA, syndromic surveillance programs initially developed in NYC, and bioengineering, genomics, and proteomics being developed at universities and companies all over the world. In addition, there are links between cybersecurity and biosecurity, nanotechnology diagnostics and sensors. Advanced systems for detection and deployment of biological agents, and political and health-giving initiatives are vitally important. This includes areas such as weaponization and dissemination, chimera agents, genetically engineered agents, and binary agents, not to mention the mass production of agents as done by Biopreparat in Russia. Biothreat agents “grown in the basement” can cause transient panic and limited physical damage, but properly disseminated and weaponized agents can cause widespread destruction and fear. This difference in impact, medically and psychologically, is crucial in any preparedness effort. Sustaining global security also requires resilient and highly adaptive mechanisms for dealing with threats. We all agree that bioterrorism events have profound local consequences, and much of the effort needed to respond to and contain an outbreak or attack lies with local agencies, local relationships, local memorandums of understanding (MOU), and local resources. But responses during pandemics need to be global. In other words we need to act locally but think globally. Preparedness by all entities - local, regional, state, national, and supranational - is essential to managing the wide range of potential biological, health, and economic threats and their consequences. Furthermore, government preparedness must be done in conjunction with such non-government entities as businesses, non-profits, and community groups like Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT). As a result, effective and adaptive preparedness and response will require coordinated efforts that cut across organizational, disciplinary, and jurisdictional boundaries. Preparedness, in our view, will need to address a broad spectrum of health and human security issues. We have stressed that the application of biosecurity must be expanded to include events that result from natural or intentional outbreaks of diseases, climate change, as well as the health and humanitarian consequences of conflict disasters and acts of terrorism. Responses based on these preparedness efforts will need to be integrated among a range of diverse and often separated disciplines. They must deftly synchronize a range of capabilities (political, military, medical, epidemiological, diplomatic, security, law enforcement, and intelligence) on a potentially continental or even global scale. © 2010 Peter Katona, John P.

Organizations are continuously confronted with complex threats to information they handle and to the information systems they administer. The information security risk management emerged as an efficient and comprehensive procedure that complements the overall management of almost all aspects of our lives. Managers in very diverse types of organizations, with different missions, all incorporate risk assessment in their decision-making processes. At present, more and more managers in industry and government organizations are allocating a large part of their resources to the task of improving their understanding and approach to risk-based decision-making. The study revolves around the premises that information systems going through a systematic risk assessment and management process and associated decision-making steps would attain significantly better the information security objectives than systems that do not. The paper provides an overview of the theoretical approaches to information security risk management, as an essential step in developing effective information security systems. The article aims at advancing the current theories in order to develop adapted methods for different types of organizations.","Decision-making; Information security; Risk; Risk assessment; Risk management","Decision making; Information systems; Knowledge management; Managers; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risks; Security systems; Societies and institutions; Adapted methods; Current theories; Decision making process; Government organizations; Information security risk managements; Large parts; Systematic risk; Theoretical approach; Security of data"

Currently, InfoSec Assessment is performed by using frameworks, methodologies, or standards which consider separately the elements related to security. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily effective because it does not take into consideration the necessity of having a global and systemic, multidimensional approach to ICT Security evaluation. This is mainly because the overall security level is only as strong as the weakest link. This chapter proposes a model aiming to holistically assess all dimensions of security in order to minimize the likelihood that a given threat takes advantage of the weakest link. Then a formalized structure taking into account all security elements is presented. The proposed model is based on, and integrates, a number of security best practices and standards that permit the definition of a reliable InfoSec framework. At this point an assessment process should be undertaken, the result of which will be the assurance that InfoSec is adequately managed within the organization. The added value of this model is that it is simple to implement and responds to concrete needs in terms of reliance upon efficient and dynamic evaluation tools and through a coherent evaluation system. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","",""

Traditional anonymity techniques are inappropriate for resource-constrained sensor networks, but an adversary may easily monitor the network communications. In this work, we focus on protecting source location privacy in the global attack model, where an adversary may have a global view of the communications in a sensor network and employ traffic analysis to locate the message sources.

In order to address information security, SMMEs (Small Medium and Micro Enterprises) should adopt a culture that is security abiding. By supporting a security culture where members of staff intuitively protect information, SMMEs can benefit much because the employees will be aware of their responsibilities regarding information security culture. However, previous studies tend to overlook this aspect. Management of information security can also help SMMEs deal with information security breaches especially that it has been indicated that employees contribute to most of the breaches. This paper looks at the two aspects, management and culture, to find out how SMMEs in the hospitality industry can effectively use them to deal with security issues.

It also encompasses information technology (IT) security to protect the automated information systems, the hardware, the software, and the data being stored, processed, or transmitted through them as well as the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR). This chapter provides an overview of the information security and counterintelligence, the primary threats to information and intangible assets, identify the various types of information security vulnerabilities, reasonable risk mitigation and security measures, the role of the professional protection officer and security service providers in the protection of sensitive information and intangible assets. The counterintelligence activities include any measures taken to negate intelligence collection efforts against an organization or its people and may be defensive or offensive in nature. The threats to information and intangible assets may be intentional, natural, and inadvertent. The methods that comprise the threat to information assets cover the gamut from old, the time-tested techniques to new, and the innovative collection measures such as data mining, electronic eavesdropping, theft of hardcopy information, and theft of softcopy information/media. Technology, which is moving and advancing at an amazing pace, results in wonderful opportunities for information sharing, productivity, and accomplishment; however, it also represents a new paradigm for security risks. Following a thorough risk assessment, an orchestrated suite of security, legal, and management solutions are applied to the identified organizational risks. The protection officers play a key role in the protection of information and intangible assets, influence the reputation of an organization by presenting a highly competent and professional image, and acknowledge the nature of the assets that they are responsible for protecting. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, these technologies can fail and are also exposed to threats that can affect their functioning and the operation of the power system. Therefore, it is very important to consider both interconnected infrastructures (electrical power grid and its information and communication system (ICS)) in the modeling, design and security analysis of electrical power systems.

Graph pattern mining has become an important tool in the management and analysis of complexly structured data, where example applications include indexing, clustering, and classification. Existing graph mining algorithms have achieved great success by exploiting various properties in the pattern space. Unfortunately, due to the fundamental role subgraph isomorphism plays in these methods, they may all enter into a pitfall when the cost to enumerate a huge set of isomorphic embeddings blows up, especially in large graphs. The solution we propose for this problem resorts to reduction on the data space. For each graph, we build a summary of it and mine this shrunk graph instead. Compared to other data reduction techniques that either reduce the number of transactions or compress between transactions, this new framework, called Summarize-Mine, suggests a third path by compressing within transactions. Summarize-Mine is effective in cutting down the size of graphs, thus decreasing the embedding enumeration cost. However, compression might lose patterns at the same time. We address this issue by generating randomized summaries and repeating the process for multiple rounds, where the main idea is that true patterns are unlikely to miss from all rounds. We provide strict probabilistic guarantees on pattern loss likelihood. Experiments on real malware trace data show that Summarize-Mine is very efficient, which can find interesting malware fingerprints that were not revealed previously. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

These challenges include the careers and jobs that we work and spend an enormous amount of time on a daily basis for many decades that eventually lead to a gratifying retirement. At least, this is the hope and goal. Employees that seem to be flourishing with satisfying retirement packages are employed at various levels of government (e.g., federal, state, and local). Government or public-sector jobs differ from corporations or private-sector jobs in numerous facets.

Using handheld peripherals and wireless networking technologies, medical professional can have omnipresent access to patient information, clinical functions, and business functions. Wireless networks bring information access, data collection capabilities, and clinical applications closer to the point of care than is possible using wired networks. State of the art health-monitoring devices using wireless technologies offer a convenient means to monitor and manage patients with chronic diseases in their homes. Hand-held applications present convenient, non-invasive solutions formeeting new requirements to reduce errors and to increase patient safety. Wireless devices also enable medical professionals to access patient data in the hospital's clinical data repository. This on hand means to access data would increase productivity, reduce billing errors, and improve the quality of care. Wireless networks are also attractive to the information technology (IT) professional because they are relatively easy and inexpensive to deploy, with minimal disruptionto operations. Maintaining the security, performance and reliability of a wireless LAN is challenging due to the uniqueness of the healthcare setting. In the mission-critical environment of healthcare, delivering the very best in patient care requires all medical professionals to be accessible and instantly able to reach colleagues as well as access all patient data. A disconnect does exist between the healthcare industry's enthusiastic endorsement of wirelesstechnologies and existing vulnerabilities in wireless technology. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) ensures regulations of protecting patient records, especially private information against unauthorized access. However, the increasingly popular wireless network devices used in healthcare facilities, though convenient and timesaving, increases the administration difficulty of network security. This paper provides an overview and guide forhealthcare managers with limited IT resources yet greater need to deal with the information security threats through wireless communication. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.","","Engineering education; Health care; Health insurance; Hospital data processing; Medical computing; Security of data; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Health insurance portability and accountability acts; Health monitoring devices; Information security threats; Information technology professionals; Mission-critical environments; Performance and reliabilities; Wireless communications; Wireless networking technology; Network security"

He also identified several specific areas of responsibility of the CTO including transparency of government operations, computer and network security (sometimes referred to as cybersecurity), identification and adoption of best technologies and practices by federal agencies, and interoperability of emergency communications technologies for first responders. On April 18, 2009, President Obama appointed Virginia Secretary of Technology Aneesh P. Chopra to serve in the newly created position of federal chief technology officer. In announcing the appointment, the president indicated that Mr. Chopra would undertake roles beyond what might be considered traditional CTO responsibilities, including promoting technological innovation to help the United States create jobs, reduce health care costs, protect the homeland, and address other national goals. Mr. Chopra will serve as assistant to the president and chief technology officer, and will also hold the position of associate director for technology in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Under a provision of Executive Order 13500, issued on February 5, 2009, he will also serve as a member of the White House Domestic Policy Council in his capacity as assistant to the president and CTO. The CTO may face a variety of challenges in executing the mission envisioned by the President. Among the early challenges will be negotiating domains of responsibilities within the White House and with executive branch agencies that have overlapping missions. Some commentators have expressed concerns about the impact the creation of a CTO might have on existing offices and agencies with respect to the allocation and coordination of authorities and responsibilities. Others commentators have asserted that a high-level CTO could serve as an advocate for technological innovation and foster increased knowledge sharing among federal agencies to more effectively implement information technology solutions to meet disparate mission requirements. Mr. Chopra’s appointment as both CTO and associate director for technology at OSTP may address, in part, questions related to mission alignment, coordination, and integration. Congress may elect to provide a statutory foundation for the CTO, define the roles and authorities of the CTO, authorize and appropriate funds, provide for oversight, and address other aspects of the position. President Obama has not indicated whether he intends to seek legislation to create a statutory foundation for the CTO position. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

Although some of the best practices are sector specific, such as ATM security measures, we assume that most of the ICT security challenges for banks are similar to the challenges of the energy sector. Therefore, we hope that this paper will bring up new ideas for those who are responsible for ICT security in the energy sector. Information security and business continuity measures together belong to the area of operational risk management in a banking environment. Operational risk management is highlighted in Section 9.2. Operational risk management within a bank can best being described as a structured approach to respond to a number of threats according to the principles of Basel II. One the key elements is the capital calculation for operational risks. Section 9.3 explains a simplified model for the analysis of operational risks and the classification of data into three quality aspects: availability, integrity and confidentiality. In Section 9.4 state-of-the-art attacks, such as man-inthe- browser attacks, on Internet banking systems are discussed as an example of external fraud banks face today. The next Section explains the industries co-operative responses to those attacks.

When the public trust is threatened, often new regulations and policies are put into place to restore trust. For example, Enron was a leading energy company in the 1990s that went bankrupt in 2001. Enron’s pensioners, employees, and ordinary shareholders suffered huge financial losses while Enron’s top management made hundreds of millions of dollars from selling stock at prices inflated by fraudulent financial reporting. Instead of stopping the fraud, Enron’s accounting auditor Arthur Andersen helped carry it out, then tried to destroy the evidence [4]. To restore public trust in the financial accountability of publicly traded corporations, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) [230] in 2002. To comply with SOX, companies have had to make fairly expensive changes to their IT processes; Congress’s intent is that the cost of these changes is much less than the cost to society of not being able to trust corporate financial reports. Similarly, compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [100] has been quite expensive, but presumably much less than the societal cost of errors, omissions, and inappropriate disclosure of medical records. HIPAA and SOX created markets for new IT products that could increase assurances at reasonable cost. As society increases its reliance on electronic delivery of services from government, business, and educational institutions, new trust issues will continue to arise, and trust-related legislation and opportunities for new technology that increase trust will continue to grow. Already there are many major regulations that address IT trust issues, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) [83], Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 17-a4 [212], Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 11 [78], the FERPA [79], the E-Government Act (EGA) [73], and the Patriot Act [193]. (In what follows, we will refer to these by their acronyms.) Information management issues play a major role in these regulations, illustrating the pervasive impact of security and privacy practices in data management on finance, commerce, health care, government, and individual members of society. In the reverse direction, policymakers (Figure 19.1) can exploit new developments in IT to improve societal security and trust. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Commerce; Government data processing; Health insurance; Human resource management; Information management; Losses; Regulatory compliance; Restoration; Security of data; Educational institutions; Financial accountability; Food and Drug Administration; Fraudulent financial reporting; Health insurance portability and accountability acts; Information security managements; Publicly-traded corporations; Securities and Exchange Commissions; Costs"

In adherence to Mathieson's thought about the use of Information Systems (IS) information security consciousness is, within that view, of fundamental importance. It is foreseen by a number of studies that a higher level of consciousness should significantly reduce ""user related faults"" and maximize the overall information system. Understanding of the context and of the original reasons of users-level errors, are crucial to achieve, at a strategic level, the above mentioned goals.

The philosophy behind this research is that artificial intelligence at the network node stage can recognize and avert DoS threats on a real time basis. Along this objective a firewall algorithm was designed that examines the header of each and every service requesting packet. Packet requests are classified into accounts by their destination URL, and metadata are being developed based on the volume of packet-requests destined for the same server, as this volume compares to the average such requests. Based on these two parameters-volume over unit of time and average volume over several units of time-an account's activity is deemed insignificant, significant or critical, from the DoS viewpoint threats, and is being identified as level green, yellow or red. At the green level, packets are being propagated as expected. At the yellow level, packets are being propagated along with a flag advising the next network node of the existence of a potential threat. Finally, at the red level packets are being either delayed or possibly blocked and a warning is being sent to surrounding network nodes and to the targeted URL's server. Although at a very small scale, the computer simulation conducted in this research demonstrated that artificial intelligence can be successfully deployed at the network node stage, and that further research refining the designed firewall algorithm is merited.","Artificial intelligence; Cybersecurity; Denial of service; Network security","Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Knowledge management; Network security; Transmission control protocol; Average volume; Cyber security; Denial of Service; Network node; Potential threats; Real time; Small scale; Denial-of-service attack"

Similarly the information security threats that they pose are increasing. In an era of constant connectivity and availability, information is freed up of constraints of time and place. The risks introduced by smartphones are analysed through multiple cases studies, and a maturity measurement model is formulated. This model is based on recommendations from two leading information security frameworks, the COBIT 4.1 framework and ISO27002 code of practice. Ultimately, a combination of Smartphone specific risks are integrated with key control recommendations to provide a set of key measurable security maturity components. The empirical evidence is gathered using an in-depth questionnaire of 67 question statements adapted from each of the activities recommended by the COBIT 4.1 processes which target risk management as a primary objective. The opinions of 58 respondents are included as key components in the model. The solution addresses the concerns of not only policy makers, but also the employees subjected to security policies. Nurturing security awareness into organisational culture through reinforcement and employee acceptance is highlighted in this research paper.

An EOC is equipped to perform a number of crisis management functions but is also able to function as a day-to-day operations resource and support efforts to test and exercise contingency and response plans. It is activated during an emergency that has overwhelmed the normal day-to-day functions of first responders. It typically performs the following functions: information collection, information processing, information display, information dissemination, management and coordination of interagency activities, implementation of relevant plans and command and control of assigned resources. Generally, an EOC includes communications links (i.e. telephones, two-way radios, patching equipment); computer equipment; map displays to show geographic attributes; dynamic data of the unfolding situation; static reference data; and response plans. This paper presents typical EOC requirements and the technology available to address them. Whether it's spanning multiple, geographically dispersed sites or crossing jurisdictions and national and local agencies, the ability to share information seamlessly is becoming more and more critical. While many tools and sensors exist to view operational and tactical information, what has been lacking is the ability to tie information from these many systems into a single view that can be shared among disparate organizations. The chief requirement to achieving this is open, enterprise level solutions that can interoperate with many systems, data sources, sensors and technologies. Intergraph provides the world's leading public safety dispatch system, which is accessed by more than half a billion people worldwide when they dial for emergency response. Because coordination with public safety agencies during a large-scale event is so critical, Intergraph's Computer-Aided Dispatch (I/CAD) system forms the basis for interagency coordination and management of operations and serves as the foundation of the decision support process. I/CAD seamlessly integrates an interactive, real-time map display with call handling, dispatching, records and information management, remote and field access, analysis and models. Intergraph's systems meet IT security requirements - such as the Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP) - and dispatch interoperability (APCO, CAP) without compromising performance. Built on standard interfaces, Intergraph products I/Sight, I/Sensor and I/Alarm Plus allow two-way communication with a variety of video, sensor and alarm types. At the same time, Intergraph has enjoyed a long, successful partnership with the OGC, since its founding in 1994, to create open and extensible software application programming interfaces for geographic information systems (GIS) and other mainstream technologies. Intergraph offers a broad range of solutions for EOCs. The key to Intergraph's approach is standards and interoperability. The partnerships with vendors, government and military agencies and commercial organizations enables Intergraph to continuously create and hone open and extensible software applications to meet the needs of EOCs. © 2010 Copernicus GmbH.

Potential problems concerning the management of people in information security are developed by using Geert Hofstede’s framework and based upon the authors’ experience in global business activities. To evaluate the magnitude of potential of problems, a recently proposed measure called Level of Potential (LoP) is adopted. A survey was conducted in Brazil to evaluate the severity of potential problems and the practicability of LoP. To examine the practicability of LoPs, the logical LoPs are compared with their surveyed severities. Our results show that LoP can predict problems to a certain extent in the Brazilian business environment. The results reveal that Japanese companies may face problems least, while the Dutch ones face the difficulties most.

As such, Information Security and its management is a critical element of the governance process within organisations. Information security has traditionally being viewed by management in terms of protecting information communication and technology systems and implementation of access controls. However due to a number of high profile organisational scandals such as the one of Enron and the legislation that was put in place to confront those (e.g., Sarbanes–Oxley Act in the United States), the Boards of Directors and Executive Management are compelled to examine their information security controls, ensuring that they are in place, adequate and operating effectively. Researches and professionals agree that information security is a multi-disciplinary, multi-departmental and multiorganisational issue which must get top managements priority. Information Security is no longer a dedicated function of the IT department but a business function of within the organisation which supports the viability of the organisation. In this respect, information security management is a critical component of organisational life. In this chapter we firstly review its core principles and subsequently explore some of the most influential international standards currently available to both business and technical managers as good practice for information security management implementation. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

An example of the application of the proposed approach to a real enterprise is also provided. The only prerequisite for the proposed methodology is a sufficient amount of incidents statistics collected under conditions described later in this paper. The reason for such research is that performing of IS related risk assessment is one of the procedures required to manage information security.

In response, the President, legislators, experts, and others have characterized cybersecurity as a pressing national security issue. Like other national security challenges in the post-9/11 era, the cyber threat is multi-faceted and lacks clearly delineated boundaries. Some cyber attackers operate through foreign nations' military or intelligence-gathering operations, whereas others have connections to terrorist groups or operate as individuals. Some cyber threats might be viewed as international or domestic criminal enterprises. In January 2008, the Bush Administration established the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (the CNCI) by a classified joint presidential directive. The CNCI establishes a multi- pronged approach the federal government is to take in identifying current and emerging cyber threats, shoring up current and future telecommunications and cyber vulnerabilities, and responding to or proactively addressing entities that wish to steal or manipulate protected data on secure federal systems. On February 9, 2009, President Obama initiated a 60-day interagency cybersecurity review to develop a strategic framework to ensure the CNCI is being appropriately integrated, resourced, and coordinated with Congress and the private sector. In response to the CNCI and other proposals, questions have emerged regarding: (1) the adequacy of existing legal authorities-statutory or constitutional-for responding to cyber threats; and (2) the appropriate roles for the executive and legislative branches in addressing cybersecurity. The new and emerging nature of cyber threats complicates these questions. Although existing statutory provisions might authorize some modest actions, inherent constitutional powers currently provide the most plausible legal basis for many potential executive responses to national security related cyber incidences. Given that cyber threats originate from various sources, it is difficult to determine whether actions to prevent cyber attacks fit within the traditional scope of executive power to conduct war and foreign affairs. Nonetheless, under the Supreme Court jurisprudence, it appears that the President is not prevented from taking action in the cybersecurity arena, at least until Congress takes further action. Regardless, Congress has a continuing oversight and appropriations role. In addition, potential government responses could be limited by individuals' constitutional rights or international laws of war. This report discusses the legal issues and addresses policy considerations related to the CNCI. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","",""

Many information security professionals focus on security and pay little or no regard to the privacy rights of the Internet user whereas the opposite can be said of privacy activists. Internationally countries face the challenge of applying new approaches to the Internet in the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorism and other crime and prosecution of the perpetrator. Securing the Internet against terrorism and other crime result in a conflict between security, a technical issue and privacy, a legal aspect. A perplexing question is whether an Internet user can expect online privacy or whether globalisation and the approaches in combating crime and especially terrorism, have not resulted in an online environment that is incompatible with privacy rights. The impact of Internet security on privacy is not automatically justifiable on the basis that Internet security aims to protect against criminal actions. The method used in securing the Internet and the impact thereof on Internet privacy must be subjected to scrutiny by all stakeholders to ensure compliance with legal principles to prevent abuse of governmental powers.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the distributed set of databases residing in computers around the world that contain address numbers mapped to corresponding domain names, making it possible to send and receive messages and to access information from computers anywhere on the Internet. The DNS is managed and operated by a not-for-profit public benefit corporation called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Because the Internet evolved from a network infrastructure created by the Department of Defense, the U.S. government originally owned and operated (primarily through private contractors) the key components of network architecture that enable the domain name system to function. A 1998 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between ICANN and the Department of Commerce (DOC) initiated a process intended to transition technical DNS coordination and management functions to a private sector not-for-profit entity. While the DOC currently plays no role in the internal governance or day-to-day operations of the DNS, ICANN remains accountable to the U.S. government through a Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with the DOC. Many of the technical, operational, and management decisions regarding the DNS can have significant impacts on Internet-related policy issues such as intellectual property, privacy, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. The ICANN-DOC Joint Project Agreement is due to expire on September 30, 2009. Congress and the Administration are assessing the appropriate federal role with respect to ICANN and the DNS, and examining to what extent ICANN is presently positioned to ensure Internet stability and security, competition, private and bottom-up policymaking and coordination, and fair representation of the Internet community. A related issue is whether the U.S. government's unique authority over the DNS root zone should continue indefinitely. Foreign governments have argued that it is inappropriate for the U.S. government to have exclusive authority over the worldwide DNS, and that technical coordination and management of the DNS should be accountable to international governmental entities. On the other hand, many U.S. officials argue that it is critical for the U.S. government to maintain authority over the DNS in order to guarantee the stability and security of the Internet. The expiration of the JPA and the continuing U.S. authority over the DNS root zone remain two issues of keen interest to the 111th Congress, the Administration, foreign governments, and other Internet stakeholders worldwide. How these issues are addressed will likely have profound impacts on the continuing evolution of ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

As communication advances and information management systems become more and more powerful and distributed, organizations are becoming increasingly vulnerable to potential security threats such as intrusions at all levels of Information Communication Technology (ICT). There is an urgency to provide secure and safe information security system through the use of firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs), encryption, authentication, and other hardware and software solutions. Many intrusion detection and prevention systems have been designed, but still there are significant drawbacks. Some of these drawbacks are low detection efficiency, inaccurate prevention schemes and high false alarm rates. Since IDSs and IPSs have become necessary security tools for detecting and preventing attacks on ICT resources, it is essential to upgrade the previous designs, techniques and methods to overcome flaws. Anomaly detection is an essential component of the detection mechanism against unknown attacks but this requires advanced techniques to be better and more effective. In this paper we put forward a new agent-based self-managed approach of anomaly intrusion prevention system based on risk assessment and managed by the principles of the Autonomic Computing (AC) concept, which has all the flavors of self-management. Applying AC will open up new frontiers, and enhance and improve the intrusion detection mechanism by not only protecting the system's information and assets but also to stop and prevent the breach before it happens. It can also assist in digital forensics and investigations.","Anomaly detection; Autonomic computing; Information security; Intrusion detection; Intrusion prevention; Misuse detection; Self-management","Authentication; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Cryptography; Information management; Mobile security; Risk assessment; Security of data; Security systems; Anomaly detection; Autonomic Computing; Intrusion prevention; Misuse detection; Self management; Intrusion detection"

This software is popularly known as spyware. The Internet users' perception is that spyware - likevirus infections - should be legislatively outlawed and operationally eradicated. However, whilst virus infectionsare designed to damage a targeted computer or network - clearly a criminal act - the distribution of spyware ismainly a commercial venture. It is from this fundamental point that spyware control strategies have becomeproblematic. Legislators have even struggled to specifically define spyware. Within this uncertainty, however, the existing spyware research has established three clear premises. Firstly, spyware is proliferating at asignificant rate across the Internet. Secondly, spyware produces several security risks - including privacybreaches and identity theft. Thirdly, anti-spyware controls in the areas of legislation, policy, and technology haveexperienced many hurdles and are still considered problematic for several significant reasons. The spyware research described within this paper has proceeded via a factor and gap analysis of the four majordimensions of spyware control: (1) anti-spyware legislative efforts in the U.S; (2) code signing initiatives that aredesigned to introduce trust into the use of mobile code; (3) filtering software (e.g. firewalls and proxies), and (4)hybrid solutions. The major result of this research is an information security management framework thatstrengthens the technological control of spyware. This security management framework, at its core, requires theauthentication of each outgoing Web session from each specific software application. The framework facilitatesthe user-management of all Web communication streams emanating from the host and this in turn must supportthe better identification of software that engages in the deceptive, misleading, and fraudulent practices alreadyproscribed in existing technology-focused legislation.","Controls; Information security management; Privacy; Risk; Spyware","Application programs; Communication; Computer system firewalls; Control; Crime; Data privacy; Industrial management; Information management; Internet; Laws and legislation; Research; Risks; Security of data; Control strategies; Filtering software; Information security managements; Management challenges; Security management; Software applications; Spy-ware; Web communications; Computer viruses"

ARM processor are most common for use in embedded industry. In this paper we propose an implementation of AES with minimum number of look-up tables in high level language C by performing a series of optimizations and their effects to enhance time performances that leads to our final implementation achieving speed of 323 μs to encrypt 128-bits block of plain text. We develop experiments by making the reference implementation, as known from the technical literature, optimized first for the 32-bits ARM based platforms and then compared with our final implementation. We analyze speed of AES, the leading symmetric block cipher on ARM processor and shows that our implementation outperforms the reference implementation by more than 3 times. The simulation results of our optimized implementation with the other reference implementation are compared and presented.","","ARM processors; C (programming language); Data privacy; Energy utilization; Mobile devices; Table lookup; Advanced Encryption Standard; Fast implementation; Optimized implementation; Reference implementation; Sensitive informations; Symmetric block ciphers; Technical literature; Wireless devices; Cryptography"

At times, it would appear that the two have become indistinguishable to the point of almost being synonymous. One might even ask if it is possible today to find an area of governance, from the micro to the global and from the public to the private that is not framed or motivated at least in some way by stated concerns for security. When one looks closely, it is hard not to conclude that our contemporary politics have become ‘saturated by “security”' (Neocleous 2008: 2) to such an extent that one might wonder if there is anything else, or indeed any politics left other than governance as security. Some of this state of affairs clearly has to do with the fact that the high political value added of ‘greater security’ has come to trump so easily other available political discourses. Every seasoned political tactician and marketeer surely knows that nothing in today’s world seems to advance the urgency and importance of a claim more easily than one grafted to security however tenuous such an operation might appear. Certainly this is part of the wager of those who advocate on behalf of environmental security, development and security, food security, human security, home security, information security, cyber security, border security, homeland security, airport security, maritime security, Arctic security, port security, personal security, financial security, economic security, system security, automobile security, pet security, space security, toy security, and child security. Even when not directly hyphenated by the moniker of ‘security’ most areas of governance in an environment of so-called minimal state intervention are only one rhetorical step away from becoming a security concern. © Miguel de Larrinaga and Marc G.

If users do not comply with IS security policies, security solutions lose their efficacy. Of the different IS security policy compliance approaches, training is the most commonly suggested in the literature. Yet, few of the existing studies about training to promote IS policy compliance utilize theory to explain what learning principles affect user compliance with IS security policies, or offer empirical evidence of their practical effec-tiveness. Consequently, there is a need for IS security training approaches that are theory-based and empirically evaluated. Accordingly, we propose a training program based on two theories: the universal constructive instructional theory and the elaboration likelihood model. We then validate the training program for IS security policy compliance training through an action research project. The action research intervention suggests that the theory-based training achieved positive results and was practical to deploy. Moreover, the intervention suggests that information security training should utilize contents and methods that activate and motivate the learners to systematic cognitive processing of information they receive during the training. In addition, the action research study made clear that a continuous communication process was also required to improve user IS security policy compliance. The findings of this study offer new insights for scholars and practitioners involved in IS security policy compliance.","Employees' compliance with security policies; IS security; IS security training","Curricula; Information systems; Information use; Security of data; Security systems; Communication process; Elaboration likelihood models; Information security trainings; Information systems security; Information systems security policies; Instructional theory; Security policy; Security training; Personnel training"

Because of these competencies, the concept of mobile agent is widely used in many different fields, such as Internet business, wireless communication, and information security technologies. Akl and Taylor (1983) suggested the concept of superkey to resolve the key management issues faced by the mobile agent. Later, Volker and Mehrdad (1998) proposed a tree base mobile agent model for access control. The proposed scheme is based upon the studies of public key and a hierarchical mobile agent model with addition of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC). ECC enhances the operational ability of mobile agent model, because of shorter key length and higher efficiency on encryption and decryption. In addition, after a period of time, due to error or change in the user's rights, said user will be forced to log out of the system. At the same time, to prevent a user from continuing to use the old key, the system must keep modifying the key so as to change the original access rights of the key, this action could cause unnecessary error and risks, in addition to the large amount of computations that the system needs to perform. Hence, this paper proposes date-constraint key management scheme, where a date is attached to the key, so as to give a validity period to the key. Thus, key management can be more efficient. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The research shows that this methodology can be used effectively in comparative analysis situations where two or more investments are being considered using a set of best choices per organisational goal. The proposed methodology incorporates the percentages of financial, customer, business and growth goals defined in a set of metrics and places a weighted value on those percentages to achieve an overall percentage of met goals.

Almost every standard on information security is concerned with internal control of an organization, and particularly with authentication. If an RP (relying party) has valuable information assets, and requires a high level to authentication for accepting access to the valuable assets, then a strong mechanism is required. Here, we focus on a trust model of certificate authentication. Conventionally, a trust model of certificates is defined as a validation of chains of certificates. However, today, this trust model does not function well because of complexity of paths and of requirement of security levels. In this paper, we propose “dynamic path validation,” together with another trust model of PKI for controlling this situation. First, we propose Policy Authority. Policy Authority assigns a level of compliance (LoC) to CAs in its domain. LoC is evaluated in terms of a common criteria of Policy Authority. Moreover, it controls the path building with considerations of LoC. Therefore, we can flexibly evaluate levels of CP/CPS’s in one server. In a typical bridge model, we need as many bridge CAs as the number of required levels of CP/CPS’s. In our framework, instead, we can do the same task in a single server, by which we can save the cost of maintaining lists of trust anchors of multiple levels. © 2010, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing","","Information services; Common criteria; Dynamic paths; Information assets; Internal controls; Multiple levels; Security level; Service architecture; Trust modeling; Authentication"

However, we still have problems; for example, database breaches, stolen passwords and identity theft continue to be major issues. Aside from usability issues, the major issue is that management usually considers information security governance as under the jurisdiction of their information technology department, separate from corporate governance. They do not realize that security cannot be treated as an ""add-on""; security must be made a priority and become integral to the organizational culture. This integration of security must be done from the top down and include everyone in the organization. I propose that the best and easiest way to accomplish this is by focusing on the everyday security issues that employees confront. Management should not initially try to force employee buy-in to the entire security policy. Instead, management should initially limit the policies with which all personnel must comply in order to help shape behavior that will ultimately become second nature. As employees learn and comply with these policies, management can slowly introduce the additional policies so that eventually the entire policy becomes integral to the organizational culture.

Despite these efforts, the battle with cyber attackers has reached a deadlock. While attackers always try to unveil new vulnerabilities, security experts are bounded to keep their softwares compliant with the latest updates. Intrusion response systems are thus relegated to a second rank because no one trusts them to modify system configuration during runtime. Current response cost evaluation techniques do not cover all impact aspects, favoring availability over confidentiality and integrity. They do not profit from the findings in intrusion prevention which led to powerful models including vulnerability graphs, exploit graphs, etc. This paper bridges the gap between these models and service dependency models that are used for response evaluation. It proposes a new service dependency representation that enables intrusion and response impact evaluation. The outcome is a service dependency model and a complete methodology to use this model in order to evaluate intrusion and response costs. The latter covers response collateral damages and positive response effects as they reduce intrusion costs. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Cybersecurity; Intrusion detection; Cost-sensitive; Cyber attackers; Dependency model; Intrusion detection and prevention; Intrusion response; Intrusion response system; IT security; Security experts; Service dependency; Systems Configuration; Costs"

But data mining often faces so much data which is raucous, disorder and nonlinear.

For the past seven years, Foreign Service officers and technicians of the US Government have sought to maintain diplomatic operations in the face of rising cyber attacks and test the hypothesis that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. As eight out of ten attacks leverage known computer security vulnerabilities or configuration setting weaknesses, a pound of cure would seem to be easy to come by. Yet modern security tools present an unusually consequential threat to business continuity - too much rather than too little information on cyber problems is presented, harking back to a phenomenon cited by social scientists in the 1960s called 'information overload'. Experience indicates that the longer the most serious cyber problems go untreated, the wider the attack surface adversaries can find. One technique used at the Department of State, called 'risk scoring', resulted in an 89 per cent overall reduction in measured risk over 12 months for the Department of State's servers and personal computers. Later refinements of risk scoring enabled technicians to correct unique security threats with unprecedented speed. This paper explores how the use of metrics, special care in presenting information to technicians and executives alike, as well as tactical use of organisational incentives can result in stronger cyber defences protecting modern organisations.","","Civil Defense; Computer Security; Disaster Planning; Humans; Organizational Innovation; Risk Assessment; United States; article; civil defense; computer security; disaster planning; human; organization; organization and management; risk assessment; United States"

However, existing approaches to delegation in IT systems are limited in their usability, flexibility, and capability to implement least privilege. The result is that delegation is either not implemented or is implemented informally (e.g. by sharing credentials between users), resulting in serious security concerns and a lack of accountability and auditability. This paper describes a proposed framework for delegation based on the persona concept. A persona is a special category of user that embodies only delegated privileges, and which is explicitly assumed only after the ""real"" human user taking on that persona explicitly chooses it. This paper describes the persona delegation framework in the context of a large enclave-based architecture currently being implemented by the US Air Force. Benefits of the framework include increased flexibility to handle a number of different delegation business scenarios, decreased complexity of the solution, and greater accountability with only a modest amount of additional infrastructure required.","Attribution; Delegation; Enterprise; Information security; Information sharing; Least privilege","Cybernetics; Industry; Security of data; Attribution; Business needs; Business scenario; Delegation; Increased flexibility; Information sharing; Least privilege; US Air force; Network function virtualization"

These academics recommended fourteen areas of specific effort. In addition to the recommendation for a scholarship program, there was also a call to establish specific IO academic programs. While a large number of universities have developed more specialized Information Assurance (IA) or computer security programs, the broader aspects of IO are still not seen as worthy of study by the academic community. Among other things, these academics posed two fundamental questions: 1. Why does this dichotomy exist? 2. Why is there such a broad consensus on the need for this kind of education and training by the United States military, when the academic community does not offer equivalent education or classes An effective response requires not only a curriculum but a shared body of knowledge and a shared language or taxonomy. The proposed technique suggested in that earlier paper used a subset of the eDACUM product that is part of an established set of bodies of knowledge for the computer security and Information Assurance (IA) disciplines. The eDACUM (Electronic Develop A Curriculum) technique and processes uses proprietary software developed at an American university that now houses one of the largest repositories of IA knowledge-base data. These data are now being re-mapped into IO knowledge domains. This is the beginning of establishing a taxonomic classification of the IO discipline is a critical first step in developing a structured curriculum. As expected, preliminary results show that there is a high commonality with the information assurance discipline; however, the categories used to classify the knowledge items have a different basis. Elements of the preliminary study are being mapped currently into candidate course material. This developmental route was taken because IA and IO are two sides of the same coin. From that original academic proposal, an international project to select key knowledge items that are shared between IO and IA has begun. In this, further efforts to continue this project will be described.","(isc); Curriculum; Information assurance; Information operations; Internationalization; Knowledge items","Classification (of information); Knowledge based systems; Security of data; (isc); Academic community; Body of knowledge; Education programmes; Information assurance; Information information; Information operations; Internationalisation; Knowledge items; Scholarship program; Curricula"

We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of this algorithm with synthetic traffic that combines real data center traffic collected from a large Internet content provider with worm traces and denial of service attacks. The experiment results show that our algorithm consistently diagnoses the abnormal traffic from normal ones, and does so in a short time with a low false alarm rate.

This allows to structure data sources and metrics, to rethink the notion of security productivity, and to distinguish sources of indeterminacy as measurement error and attacker behavior.

Cyberterrorism reflects a current concern in the way terrorists will seek to strike the innocent and wreak havoc. Since explosives are no longer the only means to bring a system down, many are uneasy about random cyber attacks that could leave us with difficult conditions due to the disruption of critical services. As a result of our increased dependency on networked communications, the outcomes of such interruptions could be quite disastrous. Cyberterrorism is an aspect of cybercrime that has thus become a growing interest in this the Digital Age. Various hacking and computer intrusion scenarios could possibly play a critical role in cyberterrorism. In the global battle of information and network warfare, cyberterrorism has become a more dominant force. However, much misconception exists over what exactly cyberterrorism entails. Media has sensationalised the possibility of cyberterrorism attacks causing great havoc. Images of eccentric activists taking down critical infrastructures like power stations or railway lines bombard us. Many live in fear of the possibility of vital resources being taken down. The role of security violations and hacking techniques also need to be better investigated to better understand the reality of such threats. Various theories surround cyberterrorism. However, there is a need for a more structured approach to understanding the various components of cyberterrorism. A conceptual framework outlining the core aspects of cyberterrorism is therefore proposed. This paper focuses on clarifying the field of cyberterrorism through a conceptual framework that addresses the techniques, objectives, target, types, effects, characteristics and capabilities required. The framework strives to provide a more descriptive synopsis of the field of cyberterrorism. It therefore aims to form a good baseline to contextually place the area of cyberterorism against the backdrop of other computer and network related crime.","Cybercrime; Cyberterrorism; Framework; Hacking; Warfare","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Explosives; Network security; Personal computing; 'current; Conceptual frameworks; Condition; Critical service; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-crimes; Cyber-terrorism; Cyberspaces; Framework; Hacking; Terrorism"

The study was conducted in the Kaunas Perinatal Center, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Hospital of Kaunas University of Medicine. The sample consisted of 181 parents and 37 nurses. The NICU Family Needs Inventory was used for data collection. The instrument included the following five dimensions (subscales) of needs: proximity, information, assurance, support, and comfort. Reliability of the scale was identified as 0.94 using Cronbach's alpha. The parents' needs perceived by both the groups were compared within the subscales. Using the Mann-Whitney rank test, the significant differences between the parents' and nurses' assessments of individual statements were identified. The majority of statistically significant differences between parents and nurses have been found assessing the proximity (75.0%) and informational (72.7%) needs related to the possibility for parents to be close to their newborns and to receive timely and adequate information about their newborns' health condition. Parents, if compared to nurses, rated these needs as more important. The assessment of support needs showed the lowest number of differences (38.9%). There was a statistically significant difference assessing the support in decision-making related to the newborn care, which was identified by parents as being more important. Nurses perceived the needs related to parent-to-parent support and possibility to share feelings as being more important. The comparison of parents' and nurses' perceptions of parents' needs in the neonatal intensive care unit showed that there are statistically significant differences in the assessment of individual statements within all five subscales.","","Age Factors; Attitude of Health Personnel; Data Collection; Fathers; Female; Humans; Infant Care; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Intensive Care, Neonatal; Lithuania; Male; Mothers; Needs Assessment; Neonatal Nursing; Nurse-Patient Relations; Nurses; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Perception; Professional-Family Relations; Statistics, Nonparametric; Time Factors; age; article; child care; child parent relation; father; female; health personnel attitude; human; human relation; information processing; Lithuania; male; mother; needs assessment; newborn; newborn intensive care; newborn nursing; nonparametric test; nurse; nurse patient relationship; parent; perception; prematurity; psychological aspect; time"

Governmental responses have differed, but commonly governments omit qualified computer security experts from exercising decisive weight in policy decisions. Given its current architecture and engineering, however, the Internet generally provides neither high assurance data security and integrity, nor reliable information transmission protected from denial of service and other attacks. Nevertheless, pressures to expand Internet-based election functions have intensified. This paper explores the foundational questions and features of a governance system that has the capacity to safeguard democratic elections where Internet-facing technologies will be deployed. The paper recommends that each nation include a policy board with appropriate computer and network security expertise, election administrative knowledge, and public accountability and transparency structures that mandate end-to-end auditability. It further recommends that the national regulatory apparatus not rely predominantly on issuance of rules and technical standards to be met, or particular product design. Owing to dynamic cyber threat environments, the board-whose majority should consist of computer and network security professionals-should issue particularized decisions. They should assess whether an election office proposal for using Internet transmissions for a specified election task is prudent in light of all factors relevant to security based on layered defense. Democratic nations should collaborate in alerting one other to election information system threats and attacks, for mutual aid and maximally robust mitigations.

This paper presents some new approaches for steganography in Hindi texts. Considering the structure of Hindi alphabet/words, in this approach, we hide the secret message in the text by shifting the subpart of some Hindi characters towards left or right, by rotating the line within the main character of some Hindi characters, by shifting the rightmost vertical line of the parallel lines formed by combining the consonant with vowel, by adding more spaces between the subparts of medial vowel and by shifting the point of the medial vowel. This approach can be categorized under feature coding methods.

These were at various stages of analysis and implementation when a decision was made to conduct a formal Security Vulnerability Assessment (SVA). A risk assessment study was carried out aimed at prioritization of the assets involved and potential enhancement measures. Security Department and security consultants (with participation of government security advisors) had previously carried out similar analyses and studies, and this risk assessment study was done as an extension to those studies. Included were core-business physical assets only. Cyber/data/information security, executive and personnel security, and non-core assets security were considered beyond the scope of this study. The methodology adopted herein has been based on that published in May 2003 by the American Petroleum Institute (API) in conjunction with the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association (NPRA) entitled: Security Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) Methodology for the Petroleum and Petrochemical Industries |1|. Also, the latest version of this API document (revised October 2004) was briefly checked while finalizing this paper. The method is similar to the one published previously by the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) |2| |3|. API's SVA process consists of the following five main steps: Step 1: Asset Characterization (critical assets, functions, and existing measures) Step 2: Threat Assessment Step 3: Vulnerability Analysis Step 4: Risk Assessment Step 5: Countermeasures Analysis Risk assessment was carried out in the form of risk ranking on a standard 5 x 5 matrix of likelihood and severity; it required judgment calls made by subject-matter experts. The API recommends an SVA team approach to assess rankings -in particular, the ""likelihood"" rankings require input from security professionals who have access to confidential information related to adversary types, adversary capabilities, past incidents, and target attractiveness compared to others in the region. Furthermore, unlike safety risk assessment, the threat types and likelihood rankings in SVA can drastically change from time to time. For example, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses a color-coded advisory system and issues current threat level bulletins for use by various states and industries. At the time of writing this paper, the general threat level in the U.S. was specified as ""yellow"" or ""elevated - significant risk of terrorist attack."" It should be noted that if a proposed security project can result in direct savings (for example, a reduction in the number of security patrols required) then justification for that needs to be developed on the basis of normal economic benefit methods such as those carried out for other profit projects. Security risk assessment and risk-based cost-benefit analysis for such a project is not required. In conducting this risk assessment, each project has been treated as ""stand-alone,"" i.e., no synergistic benefit has been assumed for implementing more than one project concurrently. This assumption is not valid in some cases. Results from this risk analysis are summarized in the form of a table listing the risk ranking derived from the SVA. For each pair of severity and likelihood ratings, a combined risk rating is calculated using the default values built into the commercially available software called PHAWORKS (used for generating worksheets for individual security enhancement projects) |4|. The overall risk ratings are then combined into a measure called Risk Prioritization Factor (RPF) - the ""before,"" ""after,"" and ""gain"" values of RPF associated with each project are listed in this paper. To develop the concept of prioritization further, a risk-reduction to cost ratio has been calculated (RPF gain was multiplied by 100 and divided by the cost factor). Note that for this SVA, the adversary types were limited to the following seven categories: 1 Foreign government or foreign government-backed terrorist 2 Terrorist group in collusion with insider 3 Terrorist group 4 Disgruntled employee or contractor 5 Professional criminals 6 Vandals 7 Horseplay/mischief.

However, history has shown that erroneous maintenance also can lead to reduced quality, incidents and accidents with extensive losses. Today, eMaintenance promises great opportunities for a paradigm shift from a rather narrow, condition-based maintenance approach with focus on a technical system's health to a true risk-based maintenance approach that also considers organizational excellence. This is achieved by proper information logistic solutions that address the needs of all stakeholders of the maintenance process, which are possible due to new and innovative information and communication technology (ICT). However, all opportunities are also linked with some threats, which are seldom highlighted in the case of eMaintenance. In this article, a risk management framework for evaluation of eMaintenance solutions is proposed. The framework is based on a combination of international standards (e.g. ISO 31000, ISO/IEC 27000, and IEC (2004) 60300-3-14) to achieve integrated Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and enable a linkage of eMaintenance to the strategic goals of an organization.

In an experimental evaluation, the authors find that the message embedding scheme allows 203 bytes of embedded hiddentext message per 100KB of covertext on average, and that the document modifications are not readily noticed by observers. The stegosystem is thus a practical and effective secure system for covert communication over Thai plain text channels.

There is already a strong internet backbone in place that has the capacity to offer high quality services to the most users. However, in some cases, the 'last mile' problem remains to be solved and one of the possibilities to resolve this problem is the satellite digital video broadcasting (DVB). This paper proposes a security upgrade for IP communications over satellite DVB that is suited for the characteristics of satellite communications and that offers support for both unicast and multicast communications. The usage of chaotic functions is proposed both for the generation of new keys and for the encryption of data. We propose the use of a strong chaotic key generator and of a robust encryption algorithm, which have been previously studied, to enhance the properties of the system. They offer strong cryptographic properties and low computational requirements.

It results from qualitatively researching a government information dilemma that a heightened risk for management has emerged from a national security environment that is now increasingly spawning asymmetric forms of Warfare. In particular, it is evident that there has been a major lift in security across the world over the past 5-10 years and increasing identification of terrorists now able to conduct Information Warfare. Also concerning is that there continues to be many interpretations of what constitutes this threat. The research meant collecting data using relatively structured interviews of those people around the world who hold key national security decision-making positions in government plus others from across the spectrum of society with the necessary knowledge in the research area. Constant literature review and relevant major conference attendance and workshops with delegates applied throughout the study to provide triangulation and rigour for this. The research participants feel that the results of the research have immediate application to national security management. Particularly, in terms of informing key parties about Information Warfare conducted by terrorist groups, which is a phenomenon that causes thinking of alternative scenarios and future options to manage national security from asymmetric threats. This paper outlines the macro considerations for philosophising about these so new ideas to manage information generally can evolve. Thus, in addition to extensively reviewing literature mainly on Information Warfare and Terrorism to define the threat of Information Terrorism, the security considerations for management and information warfare practitioners in general that have resultantly evolved are broadly outlined. This happens because it is argued that managers need to think about theory emerging from this increasing threat, as it forms the basis for future thinking.","Culture; Group dynamics; Information terrorism; Information warfare; Management theory; National security","Behavioral research; Decision making; Group theory; National security; Culture; Cyber security; Global informations; Government information; Group dynamics; Information assurance; Information terrorism; Information warfare; Management theory; Threats analysis; Terrorism"

To describe the behavior of such systems, we focus solely on externally observable execution traces generated by the observed computing system. In these extreme circumstances the pattern of sequences of primitive actions (execution traces) which is observed by an external observer cannot be designed and/or forecast in advance. We have also taken into account in our framework that security policies are partial-natured. To manage the outlined problem we need tools which are approximately able to discover secure or insecure patterns in execution traces based on presupposes of computer users. Rough set theory may be such a tool. According to it, the vagueness of a subset of a finite universe U is defined by the difference of its lower and upper approximations with respect to a partition of the universe U. Using partitions, however, is a very strict requirement. In this paper, our starting point will be an arbitrary family of subsets of U. Neither that this family of sets covers the universe nor that the universe is finite will be assumed. This new approach is called the partial approximative set theory. We will apply it to build up a new security model for distributed software systems solely focusing on their externally observable executions and to find out whether the observed system is secure or not. © 2010 IEEE.","","Computation theory; Security of data; Computing environments; Computing system; Distributed software system; External observer; Lower and upper approximations; Observed systems; Personal information securities; Primitive actions; Rough set theory"

This approach is relatively simple to manage since it needs almost no security governance below the top enterprise level where most decisions are made. However, while there is a role for more corporate governance, new regulations, and improved codes of best practice to address current weak organizational security practices, this may not be sufficient in the current dynamic security environment. Organizational information security must adapt to changing conditions by extending security governance to middle management as well as system/network administrators. Unfortunately the lack of clear business security objectives and strategies at the business unit level is likely to result in a compliance culture, where those responsible for implementing information security are more interested in complying with organizational standards and policies than improving security itself. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2010.","business security strategies; decentralized decision making; Security culture; security strategic context","Information management; Regulatory compliance; Risk management; Security of data; Business security; Centralized decision making; Decentralized decision making; Information security governance; Organizational information; Organizational standards; Security governances; security strategic context; Decision making"

We look for the value-add to decide if investing in a new method is worth the effort. How shall we evaluate if we have reached this tipping point for change? For contemporary researchers, understanding the properties of the data is a good starting point. The new generation of neutron scattering instruments being built are higher resolution and produce one or more orders of magnitude larger data than the previous generation of instruments. For instance, we have grown out of being able to perform some important tasks with our laptops - the data are too big and the computations would simply take too long. These large datasets can be problematic as facility users now begin to grapple with many of the same issues faced by more established computing communities. These issues include data access, management, and movement, data format standards, distributed computing, and collaboration among others. The Neutron Science Portal has been architected, designed, and implemented to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for managing and processing data, while also keeping an eye on meeting modern cybersecurity requirements imposed on institutions. The cost of entry for users has been lowered by utilizing a web interface providing access to backend portal resources. Users can browse or search for data which they are allowed to see, data reduction applications can be run without having to load the software, sample activation calculations can be performed for SNS and HFIR beamlines, McStas simulations can be run on TeraGrid and ORNL computers, and advanced analysis applications such as those being produced by the DANSE project can be run. Behind the scenes is a ""live cataloging"" system which automatically catalogs and archives experiment data via the data management system, and provides proposal team members access to their experiment data. The complexity of data movement and utilizing distributed computing resources has been taken care on behalf of users. Collaboration is facilitated by providing users a read/writeable common area, shared across all experiment team members. To date, these shared areas are the fastest growing data spaces. The portal currently has over 370 registered users, almost 5TB of experiment and user data, approximately 660K files cataloged, and had almost 10,000 unique visits last year. Future directions for enhancing portal robustness include examining how to mirror data and portal services, better facilitation of collaborations via virtual organizations, enhancing disconnected service via ""thick client"" applications, and better inter-facility connectivity to support cross-cutting research. The portal has established itself in the SNS/HFIR user community, and the development team strives to continue to improve the quality of features and services provided in order to better serve the community. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Activation analysis; Application programs; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Human resource management; Neutron scattering; Portals; Web crawler; Advanced analysis; Computing community; Data management system; Distributed computing resources; Higher resolution; Neutron scattering instruments; Orders of magnitude; Virtual organization; Information management"

Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to assess empirically the market value of voluntary disclosures of items pertaining to information security. Based on a sample of 1,641 disclosing and 19,266 non-disclosing firm-years in a cross-sectional pooled model, our primary findings provide strong evidence that voluntarily disclosing items concerning information security is associated positively with the market value of a firm. These findings are based on the use of a market-value relevance model, as well as a bid-ask spread analysis. The study's findings are robust to alternative statistical analyses. The findings also provide support for the signaling argument, which states that managers disclose information in a manner consistent with increased firm value. Finally, the study findings provide some insight into the strategic choice that firms make regarding voluntary disclosures about information security.","Bid-ask spread; Information security; Market value; Selection-bias; Voluntary disclosures","Commerce; Finance; Bid-ask spread; Digital economy; Firm value; Market values; Primary objective; Selection bias; Strategic choice; Voluntary disclosures; Security of data"

Hence, given the scale and complexity of current SCADA systems, there is a need for organisations to be able to model and review the risks emanating from the propagation of identifiable vulnerabilities in IPv6 prior to actual operational deployment.

Data hiding or watermarking for binary images authentication is a promising approach to alleviate these concerns. Even the use of a secret static key is not secured due to various attacks. To mitigate the damage of secret key exposure, key updating signature schemes can be used. Key updating is done using a one-way function. The oneway function used in this paper is the message-digest 5 (MD5) hash function. MD5 provide a unique relationship between the input and the output hash value. An additional string of data is appended with this hash value to represent the time elapsed and hence makes the key 140-bit long, which will vary dynamically. The objective is to develop real time, reliable and secure watermarking systems, which can be achieved through hardware implementations. In this paper, we present a hardware implementation of an invisible spatial domain image watermarking algorithm with dynamic key updating for binary image.

These attacks aim at recovering the secret key of a cryptographic core from measurements of its static (leakage) power. These attacks exploit the dependence of the leakage current of CMOS integrated circuits on their inputs (including the secret key of the cryptographic algorithm that they implement), as opposite to traditional power analysis attacks that are focused on the dynamic power. For this reason, this novel class of attacks is named Leakage Power Analysis (LPA). Since the leakage power increases much faster than the dynamic power at each new technology generation, LPA attacks are a serious threat to the information security of cryptographic circuits in sub-100-nm technologies. For the first time in the literature, a well-defined procedure to perform LPA attacks that is based on a solid theoretical background is presented. Advantages and measurement issues are also analyzed in comparison with traditional power analysis attacks based on dynamic power measurements. Examples are provided for various circuits, and an experimental attack to a register is performed for the first time. An analytical model of the LPA attack result is also provided to better understand the effectiveness of this technique. The impact of technology scaling is explicitly addressed by means of a simple analytical model and Monte Carlo simulations.

Information security provisions such as authorization, authentication, and encryption must be added to current communications protocols. To accomplish this, each protocol must be reexamined to determine the impact on performance of adding such security services. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the performance costs of a wide variety of authentication methods over IKEv2 in real and partly emulated scenarios of next generation wireless networks. The studied methods are pre-shared keys (PSKS), extensible authentication protocol (EAP) using MD5, SIM, TTLS-MD5, TLS, and PEAP-MSCHAPv2. For the EAP-based methods, RADIUS is used as the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server. Different lengths of certificate chains are studied in case of the TLS-based methods, i.e., TTLS-MD5, TLS, and PEAP-MSCHAPv2. The paper first presents a brief overview of the considered authentication methods. Then, a comparison of the costs for message transfers and computations associated with the authentication methods is provided. The measurement results are verified through a simple analysis, and interpreted by discussing the main contributing factors of the costs.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a dual-sided business data integrity policy framework. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a review of the available literature, case studies, and in-depth interviews with top CEOs and experts in the field, a fuzzy Delphi method is proposed in two frameworks. In addition, a risk evaluation rule is derived by applying Bayesian decision analysis to mitigate the risk and lower the cost in their outsourcing policy; and Delphi method is used to extract 11 DC service quality evaluation indicators and also use these indicators to conduct a benchmark in Taiwan. Furthermore, the proposed framework is applied to figure out critical service advantages as well as suggestions for the DC involved in the benchmark. Findings: The results of framework point out that enterprises should monitor the four operation elements (facility and infrastructure, server system management, information security management, and disaster recovery (DR) mechanism) to ensure and improve their data integrity; and DC firms need to build robust facilities and services in the five operation elements (customizability, serviceability, information technology infrastructure, security management, and knowledge intensity). Originality/value: This paper uses a hybrid Delphi-Bayesian method to propose a new framework, which is adequately integrated with the consensus of experts and business decision makers; higher professionalism and content validity are achieved. Enterprises can use these indicators to evaluate the service quality of DCs among DC firms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cybernetics; Data security; Decision making; Delphi method; Fuzzy logic; Risk management","Bayesian networks; Benchmarking; Cybernetics; Decision making; Disasters; Fuzzy logic; Industrial management; Outsourcing; Quality control; Quality of service; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Bayesian decision analysis; Business information systems; Delphi method; Design/methodology/approach; Information security managements; Information technology infrastructure; Service quality evaluation; Small and medium sized enterprise; Information management"

The use of existing approaches generally leads to measures that emphasize target hardening and incident detection. While such measures are appropriate and necessary, they do not capitalize on other measures, including those that surface when situational crime prevention (SCP) is applied to specific crimes. In particular, existing approaches do not typically surface measures designed to reduce criminal perceptions of the net benefits of the crime, or justification and provocation to commit the crime. However, the methods prescribed to-date for implementing SCP are cumbersome, requiring micro-level, individual analysis of crimes. In the current article, we propose that concepts derived from SCP can be strategically applied at an intermediate (meso) level of aggregation. We show that such meso-level application of SCP, when combined with the traditional risk management process, can reduce residual information security risk by identifying new strategies for combating computer crime. Using three illustrative cases, we demonstrate that the application of the proposed strategic approach does surface meaningful countermeasures not identified by the traditional risk management process alone. © 2010 by the auhtors.","IT strategy; Risk; SCP; Security; Situational crime prevention; Strategic planning","Crime; Risks; Security of data; Strategic planning; Crime Prevention; Information security risks; IT strategies; Organizational information; Risk management process; Security; Security strategies; Strategic approaches; Risk management"

First, eleven informants across five organizations were interviewed to gain an understanding of the types of activities and security controls in which users participated as part of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, along with associated outcomes. A research model was developed based on the findings of the qualitative study and extant user participation theories in the systems development literature. Analysis of the data collected in a questionnaire survey of 228 members of ISACA, a professional association specialized in information technology governance, audit, and security, supported the research model. The findings of the two studies converged and indicated that user participation contributed to improved security control performance through greater awareness, greater alignment between IS security risk management and the business environment, and improved control development. While the IS security literature often portrays users as the weak link in security, the current study suggests that users may be an important resource to IS security by providing needed business knowledge that contributes to more effective security measures. User participation is also a means to engage users in protecting sensitive information in their business processes.","Information security; Sarbanes-Oxley Act; Security risk management; User participation","Compliance control; Information systems; Information use; Regulatory compliance; Risk management; Security of data; Surveys; Information systems security; Information technology governance; Professional associations; Questionnaire surveys; Sarbanes-Oxley Act; Security risk managements; Sensitive informations; User participation; Information management"

Excitement, euphoria, and innovation by geeks are followed by industry assimilation and exploitation, which gives rise to pervasive public implementations, and then conflict among nations to maintain perceived advantages.

At the same time, because of growing hacker's activities, quality of provided content and reliability of its continuous delivery strongly depend on integrity of data transmission and availability of communication infrastructure, thus on information security of a given IT landscape. But, the amount of resources allocated to provide information security (like security staff, technical countermeasures and etc.) must be reasonable from the economic point of view. This fact, in turn, leads to the need to employ a forecasting technique in order to make planning of IT budget and short-term planning of potential bottlenecks. In this paper we present an approach to make such a forecasting for a wide class of information security related incidents (ISRI)-unambiguously detectable ISRI. This approach is based on different auto regression models which are widely used in financial time series analysis but can not be directly applied to ISRI time series due to specifics related to information security. We investigate and address this specifics by proposing rules (special conditions) of collection and storage of ISRI time series, adherence to which improves forecasting in this subject field. We present an application of our approach to one type of unambiguously detectable ISRI-amount of spam messages which, if not mitigated properly, could create additional load on communication infrastructure and consume significant amounts of network capacity. Finally we evaluate our approach by simulation and actual measurement.

Design/methodology/approach - These aspects were identified through in-depth qualitative interviews with employees of various organizations chosen for the invasiveness of their monitoring procedures. Specifically, the authors worked with individuals who had high-level government clearances, working in information security (infosec), who were subjected to comprehensive monitoring both before being employed and during the term of their employment. Findings - Through these interviews, the paper identifies four positive results of employee monitoring, four procedural issues that affected employee perception of the monitoring, and two secondary aspects that are specific benefits of holding a clearance, as opposed to benefits from the monitoring itself. Research limitations/implications - The research reported here is gathered from a specific sample: eight participants working at American infosec organizations. Thus, the results may not be widely generalizable to work environments, particularly for employees working in other countries where different monitoring requirements exist. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is the identification of positive aspects to voluntary monitoring as a condition of employment, the implication of which is that workplace monitoring can be deployed with positive results. The paper also identifies procedural aspects that organizations can address in order to improve employees' experience of being monitored. While preliminary, these results can be used to guide future research directions.

Combined with human social cognitive behaviors, a new dynamic trust forecasting model is proposed. Firstly, a new and adaptive trusted decision-making method based on historical evidences window is proposed, which can not only reduce the risk and improve system efficiency, but also solve trust measurement and forecasting problem when the direct evidences are insufficient. Then, a feedback trust information aggregating algorithm is used based on DTT (direct trust tree). Finally, Induced Ordered Weighted Averaging (IOWA) operator is introduced to construct the new combined direct dynamic trust forecasting model, to make up the shortage of traditional method, and the model hence can have a better rationality and a higher practicability.

The network security is becoming more important as the number of data being exchanged on the Internet increases. Therefore, the confidentiality and data integrity are requires to protect against unauthorized access and use. This has resulted in an explosive growth of the field of information hiding. Nowadays, protection system can be classified into more specific as hiding information (Steganography) or encryption information (Cryptography) or a combination between them. In this study, we have review the strength of the combine the steganography and cryptography techniques, since there is non-existence of standard algorithms to be used in (hiding and encryption) secret messages.

An efficient sequencing of the questions may reduce the number of questions needed to be asked in order to reach a decision. This problem is modeled as a question sequencing problem. The problem is intrinsically hard and hence we develop two approaches to solving the problem.

Although offshoring and outsourcing have been studied from a transactional perspective, the moral issues embedded within these decisions can profoundly affect how the organization is perceived by outside stakeholders. First, we contend that investors use different moral paradigms compared with consumer stakeholders, as a result the stakeholder role an individual occupies significantly influences their ethical evaluation of offshoring and outsourcing decisions. Next, we examine whether embedded issues of product quality and information security increase the moral intensity of offshoring and outsourcing decisions, thereby negatively influencing ethical evaluations. Using vignettes, we find that respondents viewed either offshoring or outsourcing less favorably than relocation. Surprisingly, respondents viewed offshoring with data security risks more negatively than offshore outsourcing with quality risks, suggesting that the issue of information security has a greater moral intensity than the issue of product or service quality for both consumer and investor stakeholders. Thus, we show that that embedded issues play a significant role in stakeholders' ethical judgments of business decisions, such as offshoring and outsourcing. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Ethics; Information security; Internationalization; Moral intensity; Offshoring; Outsourcing; Product quality",""

Vehicle privacy is provided as long as a vehicle does not attempt to endorse the same message more than once. In spite of a message having been validly endorsed, if it is later found to be false, the system offers the possibility of a posteriori tracing the message generator and its endorsers. Our proposal demonstrates a number of distinctive features. The system is equipped with both a priori and a posteriori countermeasures. The threshold used for a priori endorsement can adaptively change according to the message urgency and traffic context, rather than being preset in the system design stage as in existing schemes. The verification of authenticated V2V messages is accelerated by batch message-processing techniques. Simulation results illustrate that the system maintains its performance under various traffic conditions. © 2010 IEEE.","Group signature; Information security; Network security; Protocol design; Vehicular communication","Ad hoc networks; Communication; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network protocols; Real time systems; Vehicles; Apriori; Distinctive features; Group signatures; In-vehicle; Message processing; Posteriori; Privacy preserving; Simulation result; System design; Traffic conditions; Traffic safety; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Vehicular communications; Network security"

Synchronization mechanisms are essential to coordinate the execution of federates and event transmissions across the boundaries of interlinked federations. We have developed a generic synchronization mechanism for federation community networks with its correctness mathematically proved. The synchronization mechanism suits various types of federation community network and supports the reusability of legacy federates. It is platform-neutral and independent of federate modeling approaches. The synchronization mechanism has been evaluated in the context of the Grid-enabled federation community approach, which allows simulation users to benefit from both Grid computing technologies and the federation community approach. A series of experiments has been carried out to validate and benchmark the synchronization mechanism. The experimental results indicate that the proposed mechanism provides correct time management services to federation communities. The results also show that the mechanism exhibits encouraging performance in terms of synchronization efficiency and scalability. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Second, the information security audit revealed that 98% of the sites secured users' accounts with SSL encryption for data transmission, and the sites' search tools enable public users to search for public information only. Third, although the sites had most of their internet ports filtered or behind firewalls, all of them had their main IP addresses detected and their port 80/tcp open. The study discussed the threats and opportunities and suggested possible solutions for improving e-government security. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate and timely health record information is essential and dependent upon the security of the system and the security of related, interconnected systems. The current methodology of broad regulatory guidance and letting industry ""do its best"" has failed in the financial sector where identity theft has become a significant crime. Allowing the same outcome to occur in EHRs will both limit the efficiency, effectiveness and interoperability of systems. The solution is to incorporate security ""from the ground up"" in a fashion similar to national security systems. To do so across the myriad of players in healthcare will require regulation.

Software vulnerability disclosure, which refers to the publication of vulnerability information, has generated intense debate. An important consideration in this debate is the behavior of software vendors. How quickly do vendors patch vulnerabilities and how does disclosure affect patch release time? This paper compiles a unique data set from the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT) and SecurityFocus to answer this question. Our results suggest that disclosure accelerates patch release. The instantaneous probability of releasing the patch rises by nearly two and a half times because of disclosure. Open source vendors release patches more quickly than closed source vendors. Vendors are more responsive to more severe vulnerabilities. We also find that vendors respond more slowly to vulnerabilities not disclosed by CERT. We verify our results by using another publicly available data set and find that results are consistent. We also show how our estimates can aid policy makers in their decision making. © 2010 INFORMS.","Disclosure policy; Hazard model; Information security; Open source vendors; Patch release time; Security vulnerability; Software vendors","Decision making; Open systems; Security of data; Disclosure policies; Hazard modeling; Open sources; Patch release time; Security vulnerabilities; Software vendors; Open source software"

To protect the rights of both the merchant and the customer, the fingerprinting is designed to be asymmetric, where the merchant can trace the traitor by means of the embedded fingerprint and the customer is immune to being framed due to the asymmetric property. This paper proposes an asymmetric fingerprinting scheme that is efficient from the bandwidth usage point of view, where a one-out-of-two oblivious transfer protocol is used to achieve the asymmetric property. In our scheme, symmetric encryption instead of public-key encryption, is performed on the multimedia data, which can reduce the complexity and communication cost. In addition, multicast that is an efficient transport technology for one-to-many communication is exploited, which can reduce the bandwidth usage significantly.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a security guideline tool for home users based on the implementation of a protection profile (PP) for home user systems. Design/methodology/approach-The application was developed in three basic steps. First, a PP for home user systems was created on the basis of the international standard ISO/IEC15408.

Finally, the paper created a web application tool to be used as a security guideline for home users. Findings-This tool is developed in order to support users to understand the threats which affect their environment and select the appropriate security policy. By using this tool, users can access information about international standards in accordance to their level of knowledge. Research limitations/implications-The authors created a tool based on EAL4. In the future, tools based on EAL1, EAL2, and EAL3 can be created easily on the basis of the present model.

Since employees who comply with the information security rules and regulations of the organization are the key to strengthening information security, under-standing compliance behavior is crucial for organizations that want to leverage their human capital. This research identifies the antecedents of employee com-pliance with the information security policy (ISP) of an organization. Specifically, we investigate the rationality-based factors that drive an employee to comply with require-ments of the ISP with regard to protecting the organization's information and technology resources. Drawing on the theory of planned behavior, we posit that, along with norma-tive belief and self-efficacy, an employee's attitude toward compliance determines intention to comply with the ISP. As a key contribution, we posit that an employee's attitude is influenced by benefit of compliance, cost of compliance, and cost of noncompliance, which are beliefs about the overall assessment of consequences of compliance or noncom-pliance. We then postulate that these beliefs are shaped by the employee's outcome beliefs concerning the events that follow compliance or noncompliance: benefit of compliance is shaped by intrinsic benefit, safety of resources, and rewards, while cost of compliance is shaped by work impediment; and cost of noncompliance is shaped by intrinsic cost, vulnerability of resources, and sanctions. We also investigate the impact of information security awareness (ISA) on outcome beliefs and an employee's attitude toward compliance with the ISP. Our results show that an employee's intention to comply with the ISP is significantly influenced by attitude, normative beliefs, and self-efficacy to comply. Outcome beliefs significantly affect beliefs about overall assessment of conse-quences, and they, in turn, significantly affect an employee's attitude. Furthermore, ISA positively affects both attitude and outcome beliefs. As the importance of employees' following their organizations' information security rules and regulations increases, our study sheds light on the role of ISA and compliance-related beliefs in an organization's efforts to encourage compliance.","Behavioral issues of information security; Compliance; Information security awareness; Information security management; Information security policy; Theory of planned behavior","Personnel; Security systems; Compliance; Information security awareness; Information security managements; Information security policies; Theory of Planned Behavior; Security of data"

In [1], we propose a super node system architecture based on the concept of delay tolerant network (DTN) to overcome roaming user intermittent connections over interconnected heterogeneous wireless networks. Mobile ad hoc networks play a key role in the super node system as it can provide a coverage for areas that lack a network infrastructure to bridge gaps between wireless networks within the system. Long delays combined with the lack of continuous communications with a network server introduces new challenges in information security for mobile nodes in a DTN environment. One of the major open challenges is to prevent unauthorized traffic from entering the network. This paper addresses this problem within the super node system. Two schemes are proposed: one is based on asymmetric key cryptography by authenticating the message sender, and the other is based on the idea of separating message authorization checking at intermediate nodes from message sender authentication. Consequently, the second scheme uses symmetric key cryptography in order to reduce the computation overhead imposed on intermediate mobile nodes, where one-way key chains are used. A simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of each scheme and compare the performance with and without using an authorization scheme. Moreover, the problem of secure end-to-end message exchanges is introduced by mapping the problem from a challenged network domain (i.e., among roaming nodes) to a reliable network domain (i.e., among super nodes over the Internet backbone). The proposed symmetric key based scheme is extended to achieve end-to-end security. © 2010 Academy Publisher.","Connectivity; Delay tolerant network (DTN); End-to-end information security; Heterogeneous wireless networks; Intermittent links; Prevention of unauthorized traffic","Block codes; Cryptography; Internet; Mobile ad hoc networks; Servers; Asymmetric key cryptography; Challenged networks; Computation overheads; Delay tolerant; Delay tolerant networks; End-to-end security; Geographic coverage; Heterogeneous wireless network; Information security; Intermediate node; Internet backbone; Key chain; Message exchange; Mobile nodes; Network domains; Network infrastructure; Network server; Simulation studies; Supernodes; Symmetric key cryptography; Symmetric keys; System architectures; Ad hoc networks"

In order to achieve the collaborative intrusion detection and defenses in distributed environments, the system and its constituent components should have a common mechanism to share the collected knowledge about security attacks and counter measures. Thus, we develop and apply security ontologies that will serve as the common vocabulary that is understandable for both humans and software agents to share and analyse the received information. In particular, several security ontologies are introduced including the security attack ontology, the defence ontology, the asset-vulnerability ontology, the algorithmstandard ontology, and the security function ontology.

Some of these phones are owned and managed by the organisations concerned, but increasingly, employees are using their own devices that the IT department knows nothing about. Goode Intelligence provides a snapshot of how businesses are tackling the problems posed by mobile phones, and ascertains if they are ready and equipped to deal with these unique challenges. This comprehensive survey covers most aspects of mobile phone security including policy and standards awareness, mobile applications and security, staffing and management, access and authentication (including use of the mobile phone as an authentication device), virus and malware, spam, data loss prevention (including data encryption), voice encryption (in addition that provided by the network operators), anti-theft (including data wiping) and data backup. The latest generation of mobile phones, such as the iPhone and Google's Android platforms, are having a transformational effect on the way that we access, use and store information. There is no doubt of the business benefit that data-enabled, multi-network (mobile operator and WiFi enabled), always-on mobile devices give us but what are the implications for information security? Does access to company-confidential information on a mobile phone give us cause for alarm and by allowing employees to use their own phones for business are we opening up a compliance can of worms?

This article suggests the time has come to resolve the core issue of what organizing principle should drive national cybersecurity policy. Specifically, we argue that an offense-defense strategic framework must be adopted to think about and organize against cyber threats in the 21st century. This means that the United States must set aside deterrence - the dominant strategic anchor of the past fifty-plus years - and adopt a full war-fighting posture.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey that focuses mainly on, but not limited to, computational linguistics aspects of steganography and it is organised as follows: Section 1 concisely details the fundamental concepts related to steganography, summarises the current state of the research, and highlights the technical concerns. Then, it briefly describes the modern steganography, namely noiseless steganography (Nostega). Section 2 discusses the contemporary steganography and Nostega paradigm (the modern steganography). Section 3 demonstrates Nostega-based methodologies. Section 4 presents a brief overview of steganalysis. Section 5 concludes the survey and highlights directions for future research.

Security has always been a major concern since time immemorial. In the past, people used hidden tattoos or invisible ink to convey steganographic content. Today, digital technology and Internet provide for easy to use cover media for steganography. In order to improve the security by providing the stego image with imperceptible quality, three different steganographic methods for gray level images are presented in this paper. Four neighbors, diagonal neighbors and eight neighbors methods are employed in our scheme. These methods utilize a pixel's dependency on its neighborhood and psycho visual redundancy to ascertain the smooth areas and complicated areas in the image. In smooth areas we embed three bits of secret information. In the complicated areas, variable rate bits are embedded. From the experimental results it is seen that the proposed methods achieve a much higher visual quality as indicated by the high peak signal-to-noise ratio in spite of hiding a larger number of secret bits in the image. In addition, to embed this large amount of secret information, at most only half of the total number of pixels in an image is used. Moreover, extraction of the secret information is independent of original cover image.","Cover image; Data hiding; Information security; Steganography; Stego image",""

The time-window based local trust model TW-Trust was presented to solve these problems. It considers the inherent connection among trust, reputation and incentive and the effect of time factor on the trust computation. Six trust parameters are introduced to compute trustworthiness of peers, named direct trust, history reputation, difference reputation, misusing reputation, similarity and incentive utility. These parameters are adjusted in time to reflect the dynamic of the trust environment using feedback control mechanism, thus, the trust evaluation has better adaptability to the dynamic of trust. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the TW-Trust has advantages in countering strategic altering behavior and dishonest feedbacks of malicious peers and solving the sparseness issue in the computation of similarity.

Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative data from three in-depth case studies are collected. The three case studies are small UK ETO companies, i.e. manufacturing companies that customise generic product types to meet specific customer requirements and only make these to order. Findings - The paper identifies three key barriers: management awareness of the benefits and implementation challenges of these systems, perceived risk to the business and to information security and intensity of skills needed for their successful implementation. The paper proposes an iterative model that aims at overcoming these barriers. Research limitations/implications - The authors apply the knowledge on technology adoption in the context of small ETO companies to explain the apparent lack of implementation of supply chain integration systems by small ETO organisations; and propose a model to overcome these barriers. The main limitation is the lack of full validation of our model. Although this model has been presented and discussed the with case study companies, it has not been fully implemented yet. A full implementation and subsequent review would provide unequivocal validation. Practical implications - The paper presents a model for overcoming the key barriers of implementation of supply chain integration systems by small ETO companies. Managers and consultants that aim at implementing such systems can use this model prior to implementation to reduce the potential impact of these barriers on the implementation.

The generic structure of research article introductions and abstracts, which form a genre set, from two different fields, Computer Information Security and Computer Programs and Languages of Computer Science and Technology, was compared.

Though ontologies are publicly available as a crucial component of the semantic web infrastructure, many data instances are sensitive and should be kept confidential. Sensitive information can be illegally inferred from other seemingly unclassified information in combination with the underlying data semantics and interrelationships revealed by ontologies. In other words, the visibility of ontologies can pose inference threats to the security of data instances, and this requires that security policies be specified in such a way that the semantic relationships among data instances are taken into account. To protect the semantic web data or other semantics-rich data, this paper presents semantics-aware security policy specification. We propose concept-level, association-level and property-level access control models for different security objects, and that authorisations be propagated based on different inference patterns. These propagation policies can be used to generate safe and consistent access control authorisations.

In (Ruan and Varadharajan in Proceedings of the 7th Australasian Conference on Information Security and Privacy, pp. 271-285, 2002) we proposed a graph based framework that supports authorization delegation and conflict resolution. In this paper, we have extended the model to allow grantors of delegations to express degrees of certainties about their delegations and grants of authorizations. This expression of certainty gives the subjects (e.g. users) more flexibility to control their delegations of access rights. We propose a new conflict resolution policy based on weighted lengths of authorization paths. This policy provides a greater degree of flexibility in that it enables to specify and analyse the effect of predecessor-successor relationship as well as the weights of authorizations on the conflicts. We present a detailed algorithm to evaluate authorization delegations and conflict resolutions. The correctness proof and time complexity of the algorithm are also provided. Since in a dynamic environment, the authorization state is not static, we have considered how authorization state changes occur and have developed an algorithm to analyse authorization state transformations and given correctness proofs. Finally, we discuss how to achieve a global decision policy from local authorization policies in a distributed environment. Three integration models based on the degrees of node autonomy are proposed, and different strategies of integrating the local policies into the global policies in each model are systematically discussed. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Access control; Authorization delegation; Conflict resolution; Weighted graph","Integration; Multimedia services; Security systems; Access rights; Authorization policy; Conflict Resolution; Correctness proofs; Decentralised systems; Decision policy; Degree of flexibility; Distributed environments; Dynamic environments; Global policies; Graph theoretic approach; Graph-based; Information security; Integration models; Local policies; State transformation; Time complexity; Weighted graph; Access control"

Information security issues add to the need for developing high-performance network processing hardware, particularly that for real-time processing of cryptographic algorithms. This paper presents a configurable architecture for Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption, whose major building blocks are a group of AES processors. Each AES processor provides 219 block cipher schemes with a novel on-the-fly key expansion design for the original AES algorithm and an extended AES algorithm. In this multicore architecture, the memory controller of each AES processor is designed for the maximum overlapping between data transfer and encryption, reducing interrupt handling load of the host processor. This design can be applied to high-speed systems since its independent data paths greatly reduces the input/output bandwidth problem. A test chip has been fabricated for the AES architecture, using a standard 0.25-μm CMOS process. It has a silicon area of 6.29 mm2, containing about 200,500 logic gates, and runs at a 66-MHz clock. In electronic codebook (ECB) and cipher-block chaining (CBC) cipher modes, the throughput rates are 844.9, 704, and 603.4 Mb/s for 128-, 192-, and 256-b keys, respectively. In order to achieve 1-Gb/s throughput (including overhead) at the worst case, we design a multicore architecture containing three AES processors with 0.18-μm CMOS process. The throughput rate of the architecture is between 1.29 and 3.75 Gb/s at 102 MHz. The architecture performs encryption and decryption of large data with 128-b key in CBC mode using on-the-fly key generation and composite field S-box, making it more cost effective (with better thousand-gate/gigabit-per-second ratio) than conventional methods. © 2006 IEEE.","Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); Configurability; Cryptography; Encryption; Hardware design; Multicore architecture; Network security","CMOS integrated circuits; Data transfer; Design; Hardware; Public key cryptography; Software architecture; Standards; Advanced Encryption Standard; AES algorithms; Block chaining; Block cipher scheme; Building blockes; Cipher modes; CMOS processs; Codebooks; Composite fields; Configurability; Configurable; Configurable architectures; Conventional methods; Cost effective; Cryptographic algorithms; Data paths; Encryption and decryption; Hardware design; High performance networks; High speed systems; Information security; Input/output bandwidths; Interrupt handling; Key expansion; Key generation; Large data; Memory controller; Multi core; Multicore architectures; Network bandwidth; Network processing; Networking technology; On-the-fly; Realtime processing; Silicon area; Test chips; Throughput rate; Worst case; Network security"

However, today's commercially available intrusion detection systems are signature-based that are not capable of detecting unknown attacks. In this paper, we present a new learning algorithm for anomaly based network intrusion detection system using decision tree algorithm that distinguishes attacks from normal behaviors and identifies different types of intrusions.

Chief among these principles and methods are two useful pedagogical techniques: (1) developing a cross-layer view of systems (one unconstrained by API definitions or traditional subject matter boundaries) and (2) understanding systems by analyzing their failure modes (this approach works well with learning networking concepts and assessing software vulnerabilities). Both techniques provide a rich contrast to traditional teaching approaches, particularly for information security topics.

In this paper, we extend previous system dynamics models on operation transition and change of vulnerability, investigating the role of IR capability in controlling the severity of incidents. The model simulation shows that a reactive approach to security risk management might trap the organization in low IR capability and lead to severe incidents.

Poor implementation of the Bluetooth architecture on mobile devices has led to some high profile Bluetooth hacks. Weak security protocol designs expose the Bluetooth system to some devastating protocol attacks [1]. Because some of these devices often contain sensitive personal or corporate information, security is always an issue when using Bluetooth with these devices. One issue with wireless technology is that signals might leak to outside of desired boundaries. These leaked signals can be used for various attacks ranging from eavesdropping to injecting traffic to fully impersonating another device. Over the years, several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Bluetooth protocol design as well as the implementation of Bluetooth technology in applications. In this paper I will begin with briefly describing the Bluetooth protocol, explaining security measures in Bluetooth, and go into detail on specific analyze and discuss the vulnerabilities, and finally present an improvement pairing protocol that works with Encrypted Key Exchange Protocol.[24].","Bluetooth; Mac; SPEKE; Station-to-station","Mobile devices; Network security; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Technology; Authentication protocols; Bluetooth architectures; Bluetooth protocol; Bluetooth systems; Bluetooth technology; Cable replacement; Corporate information; Encrypted key exchange; Pairing protocol; Protocol attacks; Security measure; Security protocols; Various attacks; Wireless technologies; Bluetooth"

The use of paired private and public keys, issued by a trusted third-party authority, enables documents to be transferred securely and for the sender to be authenticated. The use of biometrics offers the potential to enhance considerably the PKI model in restricting the use of your private key for encryption and decryption. The use of a fingerprint, for example, can provide a higher level of confidence than the traditional password/PIN model. This provides the additional level of individual or personal authentification should a group of people have access to one key. The authentification of data, or a document, is often physically remote from the owner, especially for Internet-based communications. Conversely, traditional biometric usage has been to identity the physical presence of a person, for example for secure entry, or the receipt of information, or the receipt of goods. Within the EU, the European Electronic Signature Standardisation Initiative (EESSI) has led to a plethora of standards covering PKI, electronic signature algorithms, electronic signature formats, time stamping, the provision of certi.cation services, information security and the preservation of evidence. This paper illustrates how a legally compliant and secure framework for the verification and non-repudiation of digital technology can be established using PKI and biometric technologies. In particular, the legal requirements for digital signatures and their certification must be defined, especially with reference to biometric methods for certificate protection and access. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Electronic signature; Fingerprint; Identity",""

DWT based algorithm for image data hiding has been proposed in the recent past that embeds the secret message in CH band of cover image. This paper intends to observe the effect of embedding the secret message in different bands such as CH, CV and CD on the performance of stegano image in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Organisations require guidance in establishing an information security-aware or implementing an acceptable information security culture. They need to measure and report on the state of information security culture in the organisation. Various approaches exist to address the threats that employee behaviour could pose. However, these approaches do not focus specifically on the interaction between the behaviour of an employee and the culture in an organisation.

Disclosures of sensitive information such as emotional problems, sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, and genetic predispositions to diseases-could cause embarrassment and affect insurability, child custody cases, and employment. A recent survey by IDC found that ""Most consumers were uncomfortable with their health plan sharing health information with a hospital, a specialist or their primary care doctor (and) were concerned with who saw their information and were worried that the information could be made available online (and) other respondents said they didn't trust their health plan or hospital to protect their information."" Clearly, patients (consumers) feel that it is critical that their medical information is held in confidence. If patients do not feel that their personal medical information will be kept confidential, they may withhold important medical information from health care providers making it difficult to provide quality and effective health care. This issue of safeguarding sensitive patient information has become even more critical given that the Electronic Protected Health Information (PHI), in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), may consist of a patient's medical, demographic and insurance information. Thus, presenting a significant information assurance and security challenge to the health care industry as reflected by the consumers' concerns related to building trust with health care community. If the health care industry falls behind in assuring the public that it can indeed safeguard patient information, then the initiative to create a more efficient and cost effective health care system by using Information Technology will be in serious jeopardy. The research presented in this article addresses this important information assurance and security challenge by building upon past research and presenting a framework of Information Assurance and Compliance developed through multi-site case study approach involving multiple health care providers in the U.S. Mercuri correctly identified that ""solutions (to the information assurance challenge) are not as simple as adding on security tools and providing employees with policies and procedures for their job classification and requiring them to read and sign off on them."" Information Assurance (IA) technologies such as encryption, password protection, access control mechanisms, and so on, for PHI may not be sufficient, since not all individual health care professionals may be familiar with the requirements of the law nor sufficiently motivated or trained to protect private and sensitive patient information. Health care Information Assurance policy (IA Policy) may be in place due to HIPPA requirements, but if health care employees fail to comply with such policy then patient information will be at a risk for disclosure. In this context, Mercuri correctly underscores the importance of human and management factors related to compliance by stating that ""the workers (must be given) a sufficient period in which to incorporate the new structures and rules into their culture and ethics. Otherwise efforts (related to IA Policy compliance) may be frustrated and unsuccessful."" Even though human and management factors, related to compliance, have been recognized as important as technical factors in providing security to PHI in the health care industry, there is a lack of well-developed framework to understand IA policy compliance factors addressing the behavioral dimension in the context of patient health care information. Without such a framework, it is difficult to develop both managerial interventions and research studies in this important area of health care information assurance. The purpose of this research (using multi-site case research approach) is to present such a research framework that examines what factors affect health care employee's behavior to comply with information assurance (IA) policy related to protection of patient health care information. We also present sample measures to assess individual compliance. In the light of recent breaches and/ or theft of sensitive consumer data from banking, academic institutions, government agencies, and health care providers, this study provides a framework that can be extended and adapted to understand IA Policy issues in health care as well as in other industries. Therefore, the implication of this study is much broader and can be extended to other industries with appropriate adaptation. The unifying foundation for our research framework is the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). TRA posits that external factors affect beliefs and beliefs in turn affect attitudes, and attitudes affect intention which ultimately affect one's behavior. We examine how these concepts are related to one's behavior in complying with information assurance policy regarding patient health information. Using TRA, we build our framework on solid theoretical foundations drawing from research in technology acceptance model, information assurance and security, ethical behavior, organizational culture4 and health information management. © 2010 ACM.","","Access control; Bioinformatics; Classification (of information); Cryptography; Health; Health care; Health insurance; Health risks; Hospitals; Information dissemination; Information management; Medical computing; Network security; Personnel; Planning; Research; Academic institutions; Access control mechanism; Care process; Case study approach; Cost effective; Electronic medical record; Emotional problems; Ethical behavior; External factors; Genetic predisposition; Government agencies; Health care professionals; Health care providers; Health information management; Health informations; Health insurance portability and accountability acts; Health-care system; Healthcare industry; Information assurance; Job classification; Medical information; Multi-site; New structures; Password protection; Patient health; Patient health care; Patient information; Policy compliance; Policy issues; Primary care; Protected health informations; Research approach; Research studies; Security challenges; Security tools; Sensitive informations; Sexually transmitted disease; Sign-off; Substance abuse; Technical factors; Technology acceptance model; Theoretical foundations; Theory of reasoned action; Information use"

HIPAA privacy and security regulations represent the minimum standards, and the expectation is that institutions will develop policies and practices that are reasonable and appropriate for their institution. These privacy and information security safeguards impact the use of sensitive and protected data often used by cancer educators. Therefore, it is important for cancer educators to be familiar with the policies, rules, and guidelines their institution has developed to comply with HIPAA. However, despite institutional differences, certain principles related to the confidentiality, protection, and uses of a patient's health information remain consistent. HIPAA provides two sets of regulations that directly impact the work of many cancer educators: privacy and information security. The HIPAA Privacy Rule includes some security requirements, and HIPAA Security Regulations were designed to ensure privacy of the patient's protected health information (PHI).

This paradigm separates the program storage and execution, which is implemented in the network environment. It is realized by a new generation server and client BIOS, namely EFI BIOS, and coordinated with the MetaOS management platform and related switching and input/ouput devices of transparent computing. Through the interface between hardware and software, it conducts effective control, monitoring and management of data and instructions in a block-streaming way for the operating system and the application programs above it. At the same time, it adopts a security protection mechanism to prevent and remove prevalent malicious software such as worm and Trojan horse.

Typical categories of malicious code include Trojan Horses, viruses, worms etc. Malware has been a major cause of concern for information security. With the growth in complexity of computing systems and the ubiquity of information due to WWW, detection of malware has become horrendously complex. In this paper, we shall survey the theory behind malware to provide the challenges behind detection of malware. It is of interest to note that the power of the malware (or for that matter computer warfare) can be seen in the theories proposed by the iconic scientists Alan Turing and John von Neumann. The malicious nature of malware can be broadly categorized as injury and infection analogously in the epidemiological framework. On the same lines, the remedies can also be thought of through analogies with epidemiological notions like disinfection, quarantine, environment control etc. We shall discuss these aspects and relate the above to notions of computability. Adleman in his seminal paper has extrapolated protection mechanisms such as quarantine, disinfection and certification. It may be noted that most of the remedies in general are undecidable. We shall discuss remedies that are being used and contemplated. One of the well-known restricted kind of remedies is to search for signatures of possible malwares and detect them before getting it through to the computer. Large part of the current remedies rely on signature based approaches that is, heavy reliance on the detection of syntactic patterns. Recent trends in security incidence reports show a huge increase in obfuscated exploits; note that in the majority of obfuscators, the execution behaviour remains the same while it can escape syntactic recognitions. Further, malware writers are using a combination of features from various types of classic malwares such as viruses and worms. Thus, it has become all the more necessary to take a holistic approach and arrive at detection techniques that are based on characterizations of malware behaviour that includes the environment in which it is expected to execute. In the paper, we shall first survey various approaches of behavioural characterization of malware, difficulties of virus detection, practical virus detection techniques and protection mechanisms from viruses. Towards the end of the paper, we shall briefly discuss our new approach of detecting malware via a new method of validation in a quarantine environment and show our preliminary results for the detection of malware on systems that are expected to carry a priori known set of software. © 2010 Springer.","","Characterization; Computer software; Computer worms; Disinfection; Internet; Network security; Surveys; Syntactics; Viruses; Apriori; Computing system; Detection technique; Environment control; Holistic approach; Information security; John von Neumann; Large parts; Malicious codes; Malicious software; Malwares; New approaches; Protection mechanisms; Recent trends; Signature-based approach; Syntactic patterns; Syntactic recognition; Trojan horse; Virus detection; Computer viruses"

It is also considered ISM standards' complicated links with many other management standards. Principles, concepts and definitions are not considered consistently in the ISM standards. ISM standards use the recognized business management models very superficially. Standards do not make clear relations between ISM and Information Security Assurance (ISA). A real crisis in the ISM standardization is that it has no innovative solutions for modern business environments that emphasize speed, changes, agility, and complexity. The situational knowledge for the paper is based on worldwide observations by the authors through collaboration with many different contexts, organizations and expert networks. The paper provides a practical business-dedicated approach to the issue and brings together a business practitioner and an information security researcher knowing by long-standing experiences the real difficulties and possibilities in organizations.

Unfortunately, it has long been understood that good security cannot be achieved through technical means alone and a solid understanding of the issues and how to protect yourself is required from users. Whilst many initiatives, programs and strategies have been proposed to improve the level of information security awareness, most have been directed at organizations, with a few national programs focused upon home users. Given people's use of technology is primarily focused upon those two areas: the workplace and home, this paper seeks to understand the knowledge and practice relationship between these environments. Through the survey that was developed, it was identified that the majority of the learning about information security occurred in the workplace, where clear motivations, such as legislation and regulation, existed. It was also found that user's were more than willing to engage with such awareness raising initiatives. From a comparison of practice between work and home environments, it was found that this knowledge and practice obtained at the workplace was transferred to the home environment. Given this positive transferability of knowledge and the willingness to learn about how to remain secure, an opportunity exists to move away from specific organizational awareness programs and to move towards awareness raising strategies that, whilst deployed in the organization, will develop an all-round individual security culture for users independent of the environment within which they are operating. © 2010 IEEE.","Information security; Information security awareness; Security culture; Security management","Human engineering; Industrial management; Laws and legislation; Mobile devices; Awareness raising; Home environment; Home users; Information security; Information security awareness; National program; Organizational awareness; Security management; Work environments; Security of data"

Good digital evidence is becoming a business enabler. Very few organizations have the structures (management and infrastructure) in place to enable them to conduct cost effective, low-impact and efficient digital investigations [1]. Digital Forensics (DF) is a vehicle that organizations use to provide good and trustworthy evidence and processes. The current DF models concentrate on reactive investigations, with limited reference to DF readiness and live investigations. However, organizations use DF for other purposes for example compliance testing. The paper proposes that DF consists of three components: Pro-active (ProDF), Active (ActDF) and Re-active (ReDF). ProDF concentrates on DF readiness and the proactive responsible use of DF to demonstrate good governance and enhance governance structures. ActDF considers the gathering of live evidence during an ongoing attack with a limited live investigation element whilst ReDF deals with the traditional DF investigation.

We then propose several knowledge components to be added in the curriculum to enhance the global perspective. We also examine how to incorporate knowledge from various related disciplines, including political science, criminal justice, and business administration. Through our empirical study on faculty from various disciplines and the industry practitioners with first-hand information security knowledge, we confirm that the proposed knowledge components are relevant to the information security education and practice. Analyzing the similarities and differences among responses from various disciplines, we also found that albeit different disciplines have slightly different emphases on the curriculum components, they all tend to agree on the importance of adding the global perspectives in information security education.

Various security technologies have been developed, such as authentication, authorization, and auditing. However, once a user logs on, it is assumed that the system would be controlled by the same person. To address this flaw, we developed a demonstration system that uses facial recognition technology to periodically verify the identity of the user. If the authenticated user's face disappears, the system automatically performs a log-off or screen-lock operation. This paper presents our further efforts in developing image preprocessing algorithms and dealing with angled facial images. The objective is to improve the accuracy of facial recognition under uncontrolled conditions. To compare the results with others, the frontal pose subset of the Face Recognition Technology (FERET) database was used for the test. The experiments showed that the proposed algorithms provided promising results. Copyright © 2010 Q. Xiao and X.-D.

These and other forms of malware form the sharp end of a complex network of criminal activity designed to exploit computer users, and according to Mel Morris, CEO of Prevx, the cybersecurity community could be doing better at catching these malware attacks. In this article, Morris explores the cybercrime landscape, and finds out what we could be doing more effectively. For three decades, information security has struggled to contain the evolution of malicious software. Viruses, worms, spyware, rootkits, Trojans and phishing have all enjoyed their reign of terror. The spyware years (2000-2003) showed how the security industry was caught off-guard when most of the major security vendors took an agonising two to three years to respond to a new category of threat that affected hundreds of millions of users. Had it not been for the start-up vendors such as Lavasoft, Webroot, Safer Networking and Giant, who quickly plugged a hole for an estimated 250 million PC users, order may never have been restored. It was a close-run thing. Had organised crime spotted and leveraged the opportunity afforded by sluggish vendors, then the effects would have been catastrophic. Fortunately, spyware at this time was more about exploitation of internet advertising than bank accounts or industrial espionage. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

While communication networks and supply chain integration facilitate optimization of traditional supply chain functions, they also exacerbate the information security risk: communication networks propagate security breaches from one firm to another, and supply chain integration causes breach on one firm to affect other firms in the supply chain. We study the impact of network security vulnerability and supply chain integration on firms' incentives to invest in information security. We find that even though an increase in either the degree of network vulnerability or the degree of supply chain integration increases the security risk, they have different impacts on firms' incentives to invest in security. If the degree of supply chain integration is low, then an increase in network vulnerability induces firms to reduce, rather than increase, their security investments. A sufficiently high degree of supply chain integration alters the impact of network vulnerability into one in which firms have an incentive to increase their investments when the network vulnerability is higher. Though an increase in the degree of supply integration enhances firms' incentives to invest in security, private provisioning for security always results in a less than socially optimal security level. A liability mechanism that makes the responsible party partially compensate for the other party's loss induces each firm to invest at the socially optimal level. If firms choose the degree of integration, in addition to security investment, then firms may choose a higher degree of integration when they decide individually than when they decide jointly, suggesting an even greater security risk to the supply chain. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Information security; Investment incentives; Supply chain management",""

Authenticated key agreement (AKA) is a KA protocol enhanced to prevent active attacks. AKA can be achieved using a public-key infrastructure (PKI) or identity-based cryptography. However, the former suffers from a heavy certificate management burden while the latter is subject to the so-called key escrow problem. Recently, certificateless cryptography was introduced to mitigate these limitations. In this paper, we first propose a security model for AKA protocols using certificateless cryptography. Following this model, we then propose a simulatable certificateless two-party AKA protocol. Security is proven under the standard computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) and bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumptions. Our protocol is efficient and practical, because it requires only one pairing operation and five multiplications by each party. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, over the open Internet, a content protection mechanism is extremely required to resist any eavesdropping and modification on the content and the associated license. Cryptography is a general measure to construct content protection. Nevertheless, in the existing schemes, much cost is spent on the management, delivery, and validity verification of cryptographic keys. As we know, even marginal cost reductions can lead to competitive advantage in the electronic business. Therefore, reducing cost for content protection is a significant issue. In this paper, a secure and cost-effective content protection scheme is presented for providing content confidentiality, content integrity, and the associated license integrity with simplifying key management, delivery, and verification. The proposed scheme eliminates sensitive key tables and reduces the number of secure channels and public key dictionaries.

This paper efficiently copes with these challenges with a decentralized group-authentication protocol in the sense that the group is maintained by each roadside unit (RSU) rather than by a centralized authority, as in most existing protocols that are employing group signatures. In our proposal, we employ each RSU to maintain and manage an on-the-fly group within its communication range. Vehicles entering the group can anonymously broadcast vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) messages, which can be instantly verified by the vehicles in the same group (and neighboring groups). Later, if the message is found to be false, a third party can be invoked to disclose the identity of the message originator. Our protocol efficiently exploits the specific features of vehicular mobility, physical road limitations, and properly distributed RSUs. Our design leads to a robust VANET since, if some RSUs occasionally collapse, only the vehicles that are driving in those collapsed areas will be affected. Due to the numerous RSUs sharing the load to maintain the system, performance does not significantly degrade when more vehicles join the VANET; hence, the system is scalable. © 2006 IEEE.","Conditional privacy; Information security; Protocol design; Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)","Authentication; Design; Embedded systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network protocols; Network security; Real time systems; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Authentication protocols; Communication range; Group signatures; On-the-fly; Privacy information; Robust authentication protocols; Tamper-proof devices; Third parties; Vehicle to vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Vehicular communications; Ad hoc networks"

Among these mechanisms, authentication plays a quite important role in the entire mobile network system and acts as the first defense against attackers since it ensures the correctness of the identities of distributed communication entities before they engage in any other communication activity. Therefore, in order to guarantee the quality of this advanced service, an efficient (especially user-efficient) and secure authentication scheme is urgently desired. In this paper, we come up with a novel authentication mechanism, called the nested one-time secret mechanism, tailored for mobile communication environments. Through maintaining inner and outer synchronously changeable common secrets, respectively, every mobile user can be rapidly authenticated by visited location register (VLR) and home location register (HLR), respectively, in the proposed scheme. Not only does the proposed solution achieve mutual authentication, but it also greatly reduces the computation and communication cost of the mobile users as compared to the existing authentication schemes. Finally, the security of the proposed scheme will be demonstrated by formal proofs. © 2006 IEEE.","Information security; Mutual authentication; One-time secrets; Secure mobile communication","Authentication; Cost reduction; Global system for mobile communications; Security of data; Authentication mechanisms; Authentication scheme; Communication activities; Communication cost; Distributed communications; Formal proofs; Home location register; Information security; Location register; Mobile communications; Mobile networks; Mobile users; Mutual authentication; Provably secure; Secure mobile communications; Security mechanism; Communication"

A framework for cohesive integration of these technologies facilitates convergence of acutely needed standards, and implementation of necessary analytical capabilities. This paper critically reviews the reliability impacts of major smart grid resources such as renewables, demand response, and storage. We observe that an ideal mix of these resources leads to a flatter net demand that eventually accentuates reliability challenges further.

However, we find that the leakage of values AV and BV in the CLC protocol will make a man-in-the-middle attack feasible in practice, where AV and BV are the authentication information chosen by the server for the participants A and B.

Our protocol can resist attacks available, including man-in-the-middle attack we mount on the initial CLC protocol.

Since Yevgeniy Dodis first proposed the concept of fuzzy extractor, many theoretical work have been done on this project, but no concrete scheme have been proposed which can be used in a real cryptographic application. In this paper, we first give the concept of Robust Fingerprint Key Extractor (RFKE), then fingerprint's FingerCode model, which capture ridge orientation and frequency information in a fingerprint, and fingerprint's minutiae model, which are fingerprint's local ridge characteristics, are incorporated together to construct a practical RFKE.

Although the main goal was to create a standard UML profile for DoDAF and MODAF, UPDM fulfills other goals as well. The standardized format decreases training requirements as well as providing a standard display format, thus improving communication. UPDM also includes concepts found in the recently created Systems Modeling Language (SysML) providing flow-down and traceability to systems development. SysML parametric diagrams provide trade-off analysis via quantitative analysis with equation solvers and simulation tools. SysML also provides requirements traceability with its requirements model and allocation across levels of abstraction and separation of concerns. The US DoD and UK MOD are interested in leveraging commercial standards for their Military Architecture Frameworks and the UPDM standard meets this goal as it is an OMG standard and will be considered for ISO standardization. Interoperability between Military Architecture Framework Tools is provided via OMG XMI. The common meta-model also provides interoperability between MODAF and DoDAF frameworks. Additional frameworks are already planned to be added such as the NATO framework NAF and the Canadian DNDAF. Additional features such as Human Factors, architectural patterns, and information assurance can be more easily integrated. Finally, the number of tool vendors implementing this standard means improved tools, increased competition, and additional choice for system architect.

This study is novel in three ways compared to previous works: (1) The proposed method extracts iris feature values using the DOG method, which is robust to local variations of illumination and shows fine texture information, including various frequency components. (2) When determining iris binary codes, image noises that cause the quantization error of the feature values are reduced with the fuzzy membership function.

Recently, products and produce are required to be traceable by customers and buyers who ask for safety and quality. However, products and produce are sometimes lost or swapped whether intentionally or not in transportation. They are usually packaged individually and then these packages are put together in a cardboard box. Several of the boxes are put together on a pallet and wound with plastic tape. Several of the pallets are put in a container. Nested wrapping in those processes makes traceability unreliable in physical distribution since contents inside a case cannot be verified without opening the case. It is not feasible to unpack all of the nests in order to verify each product and produce when they are transshipped. The method proposed in this paper makes it possible to authenticate these nested items in transshipments by once verifying one code with an attached digital signature that certifies all nested items inside a case. Still more, the items keep traceability even if they are parted later. Moreover, the method keeps compatibility with current labelling standards in physical distribution, and it will contribute to digital forensics in physical distribution in the future. © 2010 IEEE.","2D code; Authentication; Digital forensics; Information security; RFID","Authentication; Electronic crime countermeasures; Pallets; 2D code; 2D codes; Cardboard boxes; Digital forensic; Digital Signature; Information security; Computer applications"

Moreover, the doctor who diagnoses a medical image is insufficient in Japan. Because of such a background, we have provided diagnostic assistance methods to medical screening specialists by developing a lung cancer screening algorithm that automatically detects suspected lung cancers in helical CT images, a coronary artery calcification screening algorithm that automatically detects suspected coronary artery calcification and a vertebra body analysis algorithm for quantitative evaluation of osteoporosis. We also have developed the teleradiology network system by using web medical image conference system. In the teleradiology network system, the security of information network is very important subjects. Our teleradiology network system can perform Web medical image conference in the medical institutions of a remote place using the web medical image conference system. We completed the basic proof experiment of the web medical image conference system with information security solution. We can share the screen of web medical image conference system from two or more web conference terminals at the same time. An opinion can be exchanged mutually by using a camera and a microphone that are connected with the workstation that builds in some diagnostic assistance methods. Biometric face authentication used on site of teleradiology makes ""Encryption of file"" and ""Success in login"" effective. Our Privacy and information security technology of information security solution ensures compliance with Japanese regulations. As a result, patients' private information is protected. Based on these diagnostic assistance methods, we have developed a new computer-aided workstation and a new teleradiology network that can display suspected lesions three-dimensionally in a short time.

Statistical analyses revealed that the intervention was powerful enough to significantly change a broad range of awareness and behaviour indicators among the intervention participants. In the control group, awareness and behaviour remained by and large unchanged during the period of the study. Unlike the approach taken by the intervention studied in this paper, mainstream information security awareness measures are typically top-down, and seek to bring about changes at the individual level by means of an expert-based approach directed at a large population, e.g. through formal presentations, e-mail messages, leaflets and posters.

Anomaly detection is an approach of intrusion detection that constructs models of normal behavior of users or systems and detects the behaviors that deviate from the model. Monitoring the sequences of system calls generated during the execution of privileged programs has been known to be an effective means of anomaly detection. In this paper, an approach for anolymal intrusion detection is presented and applied to monitor the abnormal behavior of processes. The approach is based on rough set theory and capable of extracting a set of rules with the minimum size to form a normal behavior model from the record of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process. It may detect the abnormal operating status of a process. The normal behavior model in terms of the system call sequences is defined. And the detection algorithm is given for the application of rough set theory in intrusion detection. The illustrative example shows that it is feasible and effective. ©2010 IEEE.","Computer security; Intrusion detection; Rule extraction; System call sequences","Computer crime; Electronic commerce; Information systems; Mathematical models; Rough set theory; Security systems; Abnormal behavior; Anomaly detection; Computer security; Detection algorithm; Detection rules; Illustrative examples; Information security; Intrusion detection approaches; Intrusion Detection Systems; Normal behavior; Rules extraction; Set of rules; System calls; System resources; System-call sequence; Intrusion detection"

The network flows had been subjected to attacks and intrusions and therefore an analysis will be necessary to determinate when data constitutes evidence and as consequence it can be presented to a court.

The method uses multiple antennas at the base station and a single antenna at each mobile terminal. When expected mobile terminals (target users) transmit training symbols. The base station estimates the channel from the symbols. Then the base station randomly selects several antennas for weighted transmission, and the weighting coefficients are obtained by using the method of distributed beamforming according to the estimated channel. Signals from all the selected antennas are finally superimposed at the target user so that the maximum likelihood demodulation can be directly employed. The base station randomly changes antennas to transmit each symbol, which makes the channel of any eavesdropper change fast. Hence the eavesdropper can not demodulate his received signals by blind equalization, and the low probability of interception is achieved. A comparison with the traditional method of using random weighting coefficients shows that the RAA method improves the utilization of power. Simulation results show that the bit error rate of the RAA method is reduced by one order of magnitude at the target user, while the eavesdropper can not demodulate correctly.","Antenna array; Beamforming; Low probability of interception; Physical layer security; Wireless communication","Antenna arrays; Base stations; Beamforming; Bit error rate; Blind equalization; Computer terminals; Local area networks; Maximum likelihood; Mobile phones; Probability; Receiving antennas; Targets; Wireless telecommunication systems; Distributed beamforming; Information security; Low probability of interceptions; Maximum likelihood demodulations; Mobile terminal; Multiple antenna; Order of magnitude; Physical layer security; Physical layers; Received signals; Security methods; Simulation result; Single antenna; Training symbols; Weighting coefficient; Wireless communication; Wireless communications; Mobile antennas"

Due to the complexity of widely dispersed assets and the interdependences among computer, communication, and power infrastructures, the requirement to meet security and quality compliance on operations is a challenging issue. In recent years, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) established a cybersecurity standard that requires utilities' compliance on cybersecurity of control systems. This standard identifies several cyber-related vulnerabilities that exist in control systems and recommends several remedial actions (e.g., best practices). In this paper, a comprehensive survey on cybersecurity of critical infrastructures is reported. A supervisory control and data acquisition security framework with the following four major components is proposed: 1) real-time monitoring; 2) anomaly detection; 3) impact analysis; and 4) mitigation strategies. In addition, an attack-tree-based methodology for impact analysis is developed. The attack-tree formulation based on power system control networks is used to evaluate system-, scenario -, and leaf-level vulnerabilities by identifying the system's adversary objectives. The leaf vulnerability is fundamental to the methodology that involves port auditing or password strength evaluation. The measure of vulnerabilities in the power system control framework is determined based on existing cybersecurity conditions, and then, the vulnerability indices are evaluated. © 2010 IEEE.","Attack tree; cybersecurity; defense systems; power system control; security vulnerability","Control systems; Public works; Regulatory compliance; Anomaly detection; Attack tree; Best practice; Critical infrastructure; Cyber security; Cybersecurity standards; Defense system; Electric power; Electric reliability; Impact analysis; In-control; Mitigation strategy; National security; North American; Password strength; Power infrastructures; Power system controls; Real time monitoring; Remedial actions; Security frameworks; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Tree-based; Vulnerability index; Security of data"

Data security is an extremely crucial issue for many sensor network applications. Data hiding technique, which is considered less consumptive than cryptology, is introduced to guarantee the security of the sensitive data in wireless sensor networks. However, the low invisibility of such schemes has always been the most fatal weaknesses. In this paper, we propose an innovative data hiding method. Sensitive data are uniformly and randomly embedded into the ordinary data by using the space-efficient randomized data structure characteristic of Bloom Filter. Full embedding and simple fixed embedding laws are avoided. Any intermediate nodes of the network and eavesdroppers are more difficult to detect the existence of sensitive data. Experimental results and performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme can efficiently protect the sensitive data, without affecting the transmission and usability of the ordinary data. At the same time, this method also has little additional energy consumption. © 2010 IEEE.","Bloom filter; Data hiding; Information security; Sensitive data; WSNs","Blooms (metal); Cryptography; Data processing; Data structures; Information technology; Sensor networks; Steganography; Bloom filters; Complex environments; Cryptology; Data hiding; Data security; Energy consumption; Information security; Intermediate node; Performance analysis; Real-time data processing; Sensitive datas; Sensor network applications; Wireless sensor networks"

Cryptography provides a layer of security in cases where the medium of transmission is susceptible to interception, by translating a message into a form that cannot be read by an unauthorized third party. All non-quantum transmission media known today are capable of being intercepted in one way or another. This paper seeks to implement a novel partial pipelined, robust architecture of Blowfish algorithm in hardware. Blowfish algorithm has no known cryptanalysis. The best proven attack against Blowfish till date is an exhaustive brute-force attack. This makes Blowfish an attractive cryptographic algorithm since it is not susceptible to any reasonable attack. The hardware implementation of Blowfish would be a powerful tool for any mobile device, or any technology requiring strong encryption. The proposed design uses the core-slow library for worst-case scenario analysis and attains an incredible encryption speed of 2670 MBits/sec and decryption speed of 2642 MBits/sec.

Sensor networks have found their way into many applications, from military domains to traffic or environmental monitoring, and as sensor networks reach toward wide spread deployment, security becomes a major concern. In this regard, one needs to be sure about the confidentiality, authenticity and tamper-proof of data. The research thus far has focused on how to deploy sensor networks so that they can work efficiently; however, the focus of this paper is on sensor networks' security issues. In this paper, the authors propose a formal model to design and analyze the secure sensor network system. The model is based on an augmented Petri net formalism called Extended Elementary Object System. This proposed secure sensor network model has a multi-layered structure consisting of sink node layer, sensor node layer and security mechanism layer. At the security mechanism layer, a synchronous firing mechanism is utilized as a security measure to detect malicious node attacks to sensor data and information flow. In addition, the model applies SNEP protocol for authentication and confidentiality of sensor data.

Fuzzy mathematics is based on the extended principles which ensured that the resultant fuzzy number continuously maintained its fuzzy properties during the arithmetic operating procedure. Since fuzzy results are in the form of a complex nonlinear representation, and do not always provide a totally ordered set in the same way that crisp numbers do, the current paper approximates the resulting fuzzy profitability indexes by a triangular fuzzy number initially, and then uses the Mellin Transform to obtain the means and variances of the triangle fuzzy numbers in order to determine their relative ranking in a decision-making process. The performances of the proposed models are verified by considering their application to a practical illustration, which were used in a previous literature. These investigations not only confirm that the results of the fuzzy economic models are consistent with those of the conventional crisp models, but also demonstrate that the proposed models represent readily implemented possibility analysis tools for use in the arena of uncertain financial decision-making.

However, rapid proliferation of the Internet and Web applications has increased the threat of information security breaches. Traditional database security mechanisms are often not sufficient to protect sensitive information against novel attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used to detect any such intrusion, once traditional security mechanisms have been compromised. User-level profile is effective for database intrusion detection, but maintaining such profiles is not practical for an organization with a large number of users. Thus, an IDS needs to be flexible enough to choose a profile granularity according to the type of the organization. Further, only intra-transactional pattern matching for intrusion detection is not quite effective for detecting intrusion in a database.

Public sector departments may have to fore-go three to five year replacement cycles for desktop and laptop PCs. Information security budgets may be ringfenced in public sector agencies, but government plays a wider societal role in protecting the nation against cybercrime. The closure of quangos like BeCTA is also bound to have an impact on the future of IT trends.

Data mining has become a very useful technique for detecting network intrusions by extracting useful knowledge from large number of network data or logs. Naïve Bayesian classifier is one of the most popular data mining algorithm for classification, which provides an optimal way to predict the class of an unknown example. It has been tested that one set of probability derived from data is not good enough to have good classification rate. In this paper, we proposed a new learning algorithm for mining network logs to detect network intrusions through naïve Bayesian classifier, which first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of logs, and then calculates the prior and conditional probabilities for each group of logs. For classifying a new log, the algorithm checks in which cluster the log belongs and then use that cluster's probability set to classify the new log. We tested the performance of our proposed algorithm by employing KDD99 benchmark network intrusion detection dataset, and the experimental results proved that it improves detection rates as well as reduces false positives for different types of network intrusions.","Clustering; Detection rate; False positive; Naïve bayesian classifier; Network intrusion detection","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Classifiers; Clustering algorithms; Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Network security; Probability; Benchmarking; Bayesian; Bayesian classifier; Benchmark networks; Classification rates; Clustering; Computational intelligence; Conditional probabilities; Data mining algorithm; Data sets; Detection rates; False positive; Information security policies; Mining network; Network data; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusions; Data mining"

In the process of achieving this vision for high-speed, highly mobile warfare, there are a number of issues that must be addressed and solved; issues that are not addressed by commercial systems because Department of Defense (DoD) Information Technology (IT) systems operate in an environment different from the commercial world. The differences arise from the differences in the scope and skill used in attacks upon DoD systems, the interdependencies between DoD software systems used for network centric warfare (NCW), and the need to rely upon commercial software components in virtually every DoD system. As a result, while NCW promises more effective and efficient means for employing DoD resources, it also increases the vulnerability and allure of DoD systems to cyber attack. A further challenge arises due to the rapid changes in software and information assurance (IA) requirements and technologies over the course of a project. Therefore, the four challenges that must be addressed are determining how to specify the information assurance requirements for a DoD system, minimizing changes to commercial software, incorporation of new system and IA requirements in a timely manner with minimal impact, and insuring that the interdependencies between systems do not result in cyber attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we address all four issues. In addition to addressing the four challenges outlined above, the interdependencies and interconnections between systems indicate that the IA requirements for a system must consider two important facets of a system's IA defensive capabilities. The facets are the types of IA attacks that the system must repel and the ability of a system to insure that any IA attack that penetrates the system is contained within the system and does not spread. The IA requirements should be derived from threat assessments for the system as well as for the need to address the four requirements challenges outlined above. To address these issues, we developed a system architecture and acquisition approach designed to separate the system's IA capabilities requirements and development from the other system capability requirements; thereby, allowing the IA capabilities to be developed rapidly and assessed separately from the other system capabilities. Simulation environments and technologies allow us to test and evaluate solutions to the issues while also insuring that the system being tested and the solution are not exposed to real-world threats. © 2010 SPIE.","","Computer crime; Computer simulation; Computer software; Information technology; Philosophical aspects; Commercial software; Commercial systems; Cyber-attacks; Defensive capabilities; Department of Defense; High-speed; Information assurance; Network centric warfare; New system; Rapid changes; Real-world; Simulation environment; Software systems; System architectures; System capabilities; Threat assessment; US military; Virtual machines; Military applications"

As a result, the Home Office terminated the £1.5 million contract with the management consultancy firm. The world woke up to the largest attempted bank fraud ever when the UK's National Hi-Tech Crime Unit foiled the world's largest potential bank robbery in March 2005. With the help of the security supervisor, thieves masquerading as cleaning staff installed hardware keystroke loggers on computers within the London branch of a Japanese bank, to steal £220m. It is indeed sobering to imagine that any organisation could fall victim to such events and the damage an insider can do. The consulting firm lost the contract worth £1.5 million due to a small mistake by an employee. The London branch of the Japanese Bank would have lost £220 million had not the crime been foiled. Insider threat is a reality. Insiders commit fraud or steal sensitive information when motivated by money or revenge. Well-meaning employees can compromise the security of an organisation with their overzealousness in getting their job done. Every organisation has a varied mix of employees, consultants, management, partners and complex infrastructure and that makes handling insider threats a daunting challenge. With insider attacks, organisations face potential damage through loss of revenue, loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property or even loss of human life. The insider threat problem is more elusive and perplexing than any other threat. Assessing the insider threat is the first step to determine the likelihood of any insider attack. Technical solutions do not suffice since insider threats are fundamentally a people issue. Therefore, a three-pronged approach - technological, behavioural and organisational assessment is essential in facilitating the prediction of insider threats and pre-empt any insider attack thus improving the organization's security, survivability, and resiliency in light of insider threats. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

With information security the tension becomes even more complex and fascinating. Tannenbaum and Schmidt believed that getting the right balance between management control and the autonomy of staff was key to the success of any team. In information security, the move to a more cultural approach to security practice means that the implementation of security is becoming more a matter of the practice of staff than the direction of management. Wendy Goucher examines this move, in the context of the dynamic tension of the Tannenbaum Schmidt Continuum, to see if it means that security will, necessarily, be weakened. Here is an experience that many of us share. Someone who remains a member of the same team for many years will probably see a number of leaders or department heads come and go. These team leaders will have varying styles and approaches, but the team itself will generally try to carry on in much the same way it always has - especially when its members know that a new leader is likely to come along within a year or two. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","","Management; Managers; Dynamic tension; Information security; Management control; Security Practice; Team leaders; Security of data"

Having no a priori knowledge on whether a security related event or corporate policy violation will lead to litigation, it is argued in this paper that digital forensics principles need to be applied to all corporate investigatory, monitoring and auditing activities. Corporate forensics are also necessary in modern organizations in order to credibly investigate what and how it happened, what part of the security policy was breached, whether existing corporate security mechanisms are sufficient and responding promptly, help investigate the impact and costs of a security incident, help management take well documented actions, and so forth. Forensic practices are therefore departing fast from the niche of law enforcement and becoming a business function and infrastructural component. This migration poses new challenges to security professionals that must be resolved. Furthermore, protecting information and information assets solely through technical means and security procedures is also no longer sufficient in modern corporate environments, as accountability from management is also needed. Forensic readiness helps enhance the security strategy of an organization, reduce the impact of a security incident and provide management with the means to demonstrate that reasonable care has been taken to protect information resources. Forensic readiness is becoming important for modern corporate environments and a significant component of the Information Security Good Practice. In this paper we also advocate that the scope of forensics needs to be expanded in order to encompass the whole information security domain and we address a number of related issues that need further attention or must be resolved in order to take full advantage of forensic readiness in a corporate environment. The expanded scope of information security due to the inclusion of forensic readiness is expected to disturb established information security good practices. As such we challenge the concept of a generic good practice, its applicability to a specific organizational context and we investigate alternatives for adapting information security good practices to accommodate digital forensics processes. © 2010 IEEE.","Corporate digital forensics; Digital forensic readiness; Security policy","Computer crime; Electronic crime countermeasures; Public policy; Security systems; Business functions; Corporate environment; Corporate policies; Digital forensic; Digital forensic readiness; Essential component; Forensic readiness; Good practices; Information assets; Information security; Organizational context; Priori knowledge; Protect information; Security incident; Security mechanism; Security policy; Security procedures; Security professionals; Security strategies; Security of data"

While some uncertainties can be resolved through the design process, others must be addressed experientially, through action (implementation or enactment) punctuated by reflection. Online learning designs, since they are often motivated by broad, asynchronous accessibility, offer both unique challenges and opportunities for design reflection. The challenges tend to concern greater diversity among larger learner populations, and therefore a need to account for greater potential variance in learner experiences.

Most laws provide a safe harbour to this obligation if acquired data has been encrypted. There are three types of safe harbour: an exemption; a rebuttable presumption and factor-based analysis. We demonstrate, using three condition-based scenarios, that the broad formulation of most encryption safe harbours is based on the flawed assumption that encryption is the silver bullet for personal information protection. We then contend that reliance upon an encryption safe harbour should be dependent upon a rigorous and competent risk-based review that is required on a case-by-case basis.

But the modifications of data structure will necessarily lead to some inconsistencies in a system. By finding the inconsistencies in a system, we can detect the rootkit. Our approach has four main steps: (1) elaborately choose data structures in different layers of a system; (2) perform the same information-calculation process by using different layers of data structures respectively, and form a information space according to the result obtained after each calculation; (3) defines rules as invariants based on information spaces formed in step (2); (4) if these rules are held, the system is clean; otherwise the system is probably infected by a rootkit. © 2010 IEEE.","Information security; Rootkit","Computer crime; Data structures; Security of data; Calculation process; Computer security; Information security; Information spaces; Malware detection; Rootkits; Rule-based approach; Information management"

These strategies typically call for both Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and home Internet users to adopt a greater share of the responsibility for overall security. However, to date no study has attempted to determine how accepting the public would be of these strategies. This study takes the first step in filling that gap. The results of this pilot survey suggest that, in general, individuals would be willing to spend additional time each month meeting security requirements set by their ISPs. The results also suggest that although only 50% of respondents would be willing to pay their ISP more per month to protect themselves from cyber threats, more people would be willing to do so if they perceived ISPs as being effective or very effective at reducing such threats. The findings provide important guidance for policy makers and ISPs seeking to gain support for such strategies. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Botnets; cybersecurity; digital infrastructure; economic incentives; Internet Services Providers; threat reduction strategies","Internet; Network security; World Wide Web; Botnets; Cyber security; Economic incentive; Internet services; Reduction strategy; Internet service providers"

A new image encryption algorithm based on encryption template is presented in this paper. This algorithm is implemented by using the natural DNA sequences as main keys and the new defined encryption template as main tool to fully exert the special advantages. Firstly, the original image is confused in the light of the chaotic sequence is generated by Logistic Mapping. Secondly, the encryption template is generated by the new given definition in which DNA sequences and chaos game representation are used. Thirdly, the pixel gray values of the new image and the ones of the encryption template are XORed bit-by-bit. The experimental result demonstrates that the image encryption algorithm is feasible and simple. Through performance analysis, this algorithm is robust against all kinds of attacks and owns higher security.

Based on previous studies, it was hypothesized that negatively-framed messages would have a greater effect on the adoption of security technologies which detect system abuse than on technologies for prevention. To test this hypothesis, two security technologies were selected: one to represent preventative technologies and one to represent detective technologies. Undergraduate business students at a major southeastern university were first introduced to both security technologies, then exposed to negatively-framed messages and asked to complete a survey regarding their attitudes and intentions toward adopting each. In line with previous studies, it was determined that negatively-framed messages are better suited for detection technologies than for prevention technologies, and that IS managers should become more sensitive to the manner in which new security technologies are introduced and to the factors that help shape adoption intentions.","Detection; Information security; Message framing; Persuasion; Prevention; Technology adoption","Error detection; Security of data; Students; Adoption intention; Detection technology; Message framing; Persuasion; Prevention; Prevention technologies; Security technology; Technology adoption; Technology"

The Information Security Management System standards specify guidelines and a general framework for risk assessment In many existing standards, such as NIST and ISO27001, risk assessment is described however, while these standards present some guidelines, there are no details on how to implement it in an organization. In a complex organization, risk assessment is a complicated process and involves a lot of assets. In this paper, we present the FEMRA model, which uses fuzzy expert systems to assess risk in organizations. The risk assessment varies considerably with the context, the metrics used as dependent variables, and the opinions of the persons involved. Fuzzy logic thus represents an excellent model for this application. Organizations can use FEMRA as a tool to improve the ISMS implementation. One of the interesting characteristics of FEMRA is that it can represent each risk with a numerical value. The managers can detect higher risks by comparing these values and develop a good strategy to reduce them. © 2010 IEEE.","Asset; Fuzzy; Risk assessment; Threat; Vulnerability","Expert systems; Fuzzy logic; Internet; Risk management; Standards; Dependent variables; Fuzzy expert; Fuzzy expert systems; Fuzzy risk; Information security management systems; Numerical values; Risk assessment"

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our evaluation of the distributed algorithm using QSSVM reveals that it detects anomalies with comparable accuracy and less communication overhead than a centralized approach. © 2010 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; distributed computing; information security; machine learning; outlier detection; security; support vector machines (SVMs); wireless sensor networks","Computational complexity; Gears; Intrusion detection; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Spheres; Support vector machines; Telecommunication equipment; Vector spaces; Vectors; Anomaly detection; Distributed Computing; Information security; Machine-learning; Outlier Detection; security; Support vector; Wireless sensor; Wireless sensor networks"

In Chapter 1 the terms in the title are defined, and a comprehensive overview of botnets is provided in order to equip the reader with an understanding of the context for the remaining chapters. The motives for using botnets and the methods in which they are used are outlined. The methods of botnet attack are then analysed in terms of their potential impact on information security and a conclusion is drawn that botnets are indeed a threat to information security in general terms. Chapter 2 then goes on to examine the extent of the threat from the three different perspectives of governments, corporate and the general public. The threats from each perspective and their impacts are identified, and each threat type for each perspective is then categorised in terms of probability and potential impact. The extent of the threat of each botnet-related attack from each perspective is then assessed using a model recommended by ISO/IEC 27005:2008, and the conclusion is drawn that the extent of the threat that botnets pose to governments, corporates and the general public is High. In Chapter 3, we look at how law enforcement agencies investigate botnets and the criminals behind them, and establish the challenges they face in doing so. It is clear that law enforcement face an uphill struggle due to technical tricks employed by the botherders to remain untraceable, lack of resources with the necessary skillset, the legal complexity of working with multiple jurisdictions, and procedural delays working with foreign law enforcement agencies. The conclusion is drawn that botnets are here to stay and that for the time being the botherders will have the upper hand. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The main focus of this method is on steganography in Black & white picture image. This method embeds more number of bits in a block as compared to earlier methods, which are limited to one or two bits. This method suggests the searching of the block of suitable size and choosing it for data embedding. The selection of block size is dependent on the encrypted secret message pattern which is encrypted using a secret key shared by sender and receiver and the pattern of block. Here main aim is to utilize the image as much as possible with its own pattern of black and white pixel. In this method very first the encrypted message pattern is taken and it is matched with the block size of 2X2, 3X3 and like wise. The blocks which are giving maximum matching with the bits of the encrypted message is selected for the embedding. To maintain the visual quality of image we will only change at the maximum 2 pixels in the block if size is more than 2X2 and 1 pixel for 2X2 block. To extract the correct data we will use the odd even feature of the block of size 3X3, which will be utilized to keep the embedding information that is size of the message, block size and locations where data is embedded. This information is also encrypted with secret key for security purpose and embedding will start from the end of the image that is right bottom corner and scanning and embedding will be from right to left and bottom to top. This information is used to extract exact amount of data without the need of checking total image. The secret message is extracted after decoding extracted bits from the stego-image with secret key without using original image accurately. This method will prove to be good for embedding increased capacity of data without causing much distortion .© 2010 IEEE.","Binary images; Data extraction; Data hiding; Image processing; Information security; Steganography","Binary images; Data mining; Feature extraction; Imaging systems; Information management; Network security; Pixels; Steganography; Black and white pixels; Block sizes; Data embedding; Data extraction; Data hiding; Embedding information; Encrypted messages; Information security; Maximum matchings; Novel methods; Original images; Secret key; Secret messages; Stego image; Visual qualities; Cryptography"

Our goal is to understand the general principles that could lead to successful watermarking methods. Whereas cryptography is a relatively mature area of information security, serious study of digital watermarking began only recently, and much is yet unknown. Digital Piracy poses an unprecedented array of threats, ranging from intellectual property violations; to military, industrial and economic espionage; to outright despicable theft of works available in digital format. Digital watermarking while nascent is a promising technology that offers protection of unencrypted or decrypted digital content. The three main technical challenges faced by watermarking algorithms are fidelity, robustness and security. Current watermarking methods while offering acceptable fidelity and robustness against certain types of processing, fail to overcome data compression and noise addition challenges. Further difficulties are encountered when robust geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation and cropping of still and moving images takes place. Theoretical approaches have been developed that could lead to secure watermarking methods, but substantial gaps remain between theory and practice. The merging of computation and communication, as embodied in the myriad of digital devices and communications systems present substantial new challenges and opportunities for the processing and distribution of valuable digital creations such as audio tracks, still images, and movies for commercial, military and educational purposes. At the same time, new technology has opened the Pandora's Box of cheap, easy copying and distribution of pirated material. A standard and wellunderstood technical approach to reducing piracy is to use cryptography, where, only authorized users have the decryption keys. Cryptography is useful so long as the authorized user has no intention of making free copies of protected material and distributing them to friends or relatives. A complementary approach that offers protection of unencrypted material is digital watermarking to effectively limit illegal copying and distribution. We conclude the paper by presenting a digital water marking algorithm based on Quantized Index Modulated Convoluted Bezier and Hermite Splines. Using this technique, vital data can be hidden and transmitted using random phase carrier techniques. The theory behind this method is reviewed and shown to hide both pictorial and non-pictorial data with fidelity, robustness and security. The details of the procedures used for design, possible optimization, message extraction, optimization, synchronization, rotation and scaling are also discussed.

Information security is becoming more and more important. Applications such as covert communication, copyright protection, etc, stimulate the research of information hiding techniques. Traditionally, encryption is used to realize the communication security. However, important information is not protected once decoded. Steganography is the art and science of communicating in a way which hides the existence of the communication. Important information is firstly hidden in a host data, such as digital image, video or audio, etc, and then transmitted secretly to the receiver.In this paper a data hiding model with high security features combining both cryptography using finite state sequential machine and image based steganography technique for communicating information more securely between two locations is proposed. The authors incorporated the idea of secret key for authentication at both ends in order to achieve high level of security. Before the embedding operation the secret information has been encrypted with the help of finite-state sequential machine and segmented in different parts. The cover image is also segmented in different objects through normalized cut.Each part of the encoded secret information has been embedded with the help of a novel image steganographic method (PMM) on different cuts of the cover image to form different stego objects. Finally stego image is formed by combining different stego objects and transmit to the receiver side. At the receiving end different opposite processes should run to get the back the original secret message.","Cover image; Finite state sequential machine; Melay machine; NCUT; Pixel mapping method (PMM); Stego image","Computer graphics; Copyrights; Cryptography; Pixels; Security systems; Steganography; Cover-image; Finite state; Melay machine; NCUT; Pixel mapping method (PMM); Stego image; Network security"

While it is well-known that such signal processing hardware needs to be implemented under tight area and power constraints for small footprint and increased battery-life, new design requirements emerge with their increasing complexity. Use of nanoscale technology shows tremendous benefits in implementing these advanced circuits due to dramatic improvement in integration density and power dissipation per operation. However, it also brings in new challenges such as reliability and high leakage power. Besides, programmability of the device and security of the recorded information are desirable features, which need to be considered during the design of such systems. Programmability is important to adapt to individual subjects as well as to the temporal fluctuations in subject condition. On the other hand, information security is rapidly becoming an important design parameter since the recorded signal often needs to be transmitted outside the body through wireless channels. In this paper, we analyze the emerging issues associated with the design of the DSP unit in an implantable system. We note that conventional design solutions may not be attractive for such systems.

The image is first decomposed into non-overlapping blocks and scrambling of these blocks is done by using 2D Cat transform. Multi-level blocks scrambling (MLBS) is implemented by starting with a large block size and the size of blocks gets reduced iteratively at each level. The scrambling of blocks is performed at multiple levels to get cummulative effect. At each level, the control parameters of scrambling are randomly generated through 2D coupled Logistic map to make the process of scrambling key dependent. The scrambled image obtained after carrying out MLBS scrambling is encrypted using chaotic sequence generated by one-dimensional Logistic map. The experimental results show that the proposed encryption scheme can successfully encrypts/decrypts the images with same secret keys. The algorithm has large key space and high sensitivity to a small change in secret keys.

We investigate the feasibility to use current GPUs for asynchronous host intrusion detection as proposed in a former work and come to the conclusion that several constraints of GPUs limit the use for concurrent and asynchronous off-CPU processing in host IDSs. GPUs have restrictions in terms of continuity, asynchronism, and unrestricted access to perform this task.

At the same time, mobile devices such as personal digital assistants and smart phones are increasing in popularity. This paper seeks to examine the supply of pirate software for mobile devices, against a backdrop of conventional desktop piracy theory. Design/methodology/approach Using a novel data set of pirate software releases, the paper reviews 18,000 entries from a pirate software database to examine the type and origin of this software. Findings The paper finds that more popular platforms are not necessarily subject to greater levels of software piracy. For mobile devices, productivity software was more popular than game software. Many piracy groups were involved, but only four groups were responsible for over half of all releases. Some popular devices, such as the Blackberry and Apple iPhone, showed little to no piracy levels. Research limitations/implications As with empirical research into any criminal or deviant behaviour, there may be intention to deceive. The findings regarding device popularity and availability of pirate software have implications for demand-side research. Practical implications The findings provide insights for business managers and information security professionals in the telecommunications and mobile applications industries. Originality/value Prior research work has focused on software for desktop computers. This study contributes by being some of the first published work on piracy for mobile devices. The work is also original in that most prior research has focused on the demand for pirate software.

A feed forward network called the back propagation network is trained to classify data as being normal or intrusive. Five training functions are used and analysis is done to decide which training function gives an optimal performance. In addition, the selection of a subset will reduce the dimensionality of the data samples and eliminate the redundancy and ambiguity introduced by some attributes. The user classifier can then operate only on the selected features to perform the learning process. Experiments are performed using kddcup99 dataset.

An DoS attack notification is sent back from the edge routers to the entrance-side edge routers, which mark matching IP packets and send them around a loop added to their route. The feature of our method is that attack packets are delayed rather than just discarded to avoid the loss of normal packets misrecognized as attack packets by letting the end user decide their normality. This is acceptable because DoS attack packets are usually meaningless rather than dangerous. Our method eliminates attack-induced congestion and restores service provision.

The state of the art lacks a systematic methodology to support security investment decision-making. We describe a methodology that integrates methods from multi-attribute utility evaluation and mathematical systems modelling. We illustrate our approach using a collaborative case study with the security managers of a large organization divesting itself of its IT support services. The case study was validated against the experience and observations of the security managers and delivered, according to their judgement, useful results. Specifically, by integrating a mathematical model of system behaviour with an account of the utility of available security investment strategies, the case study has enabled them to understand better the trade-offs between the security performance and the operational consequences of their choices. © 2010 IEEE.","Decision support; Economics; Information security; Risk management; Systems modelling","Computer supported cooperative work; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economics; Investments; Managers; Research; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security of data; Security systems; Technical presentations; Business objectives; Decision supports; Fixed budget; Information security; IT support services; Large organizations; Multi-attribute utility; Security investments; Security manager; Security measure; State of the art; Systematic methodology; Systems modelling; Systems security; Mathematical models"

Some of the principle problems are identified and a first group of relevant dimensions is presented for an efficient management of information security. The study is based on the literature review made, using some of the more relevant certified articles of this theme, in international reports and in the principle norms of management of information security. From the readings that were done, we identified some of the methods oriented for risk management, norms of certification and good practice of security of information. Some of the norms are oriented for the certification of the product or system and others oriented to the processes of the business. There are also studies with the proposal of Frameworks that suggest the integration of different approaches with the foundation of norms focused on technologies, in processes and taking into consideration the organizational and human environment of the organizations. In our perspective, the biggest contribute to the security of information is the development of a method of security of information for an organization in a conflicting environment. This should make available the security of information, against the possible dimensions of attack that the threats could exploit, through the vulnerability of the organizational actives.

This book chapter will focus on the encryption techniques for H.264, which is the latest video coding standard and has become one of the most promising techniques for future video communications. A major concern in the design of H.264 encryption algorithms is how to achieve a sufficiently high level of security, while maintaining the efficiency of the underlying compression algorithm. In this chapter, a review on various H.264 video encryption methods will first be performed. Feasibility study on various techniques meeting application specific criteria will be carried out and some problems of the existing techniques will be pointed out. As chaos has intrinsic properties such as sensitivity to initial conditions, deterministic oscillations and noise-like behavior, it has acquired much attention for video content protection. A novel joint compression and encryption scheme based on the context-based adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) module of H.264 video codec is then presented using a chaotic stream cipher. It is shown that the proposed H.264 encryption scheme based on a discrete piecewise linear chaotic map is secure in perception, efficient and format compliant and suitable for practical video protection. Finally, some possible directions on H.264 encryption will also be discussed in this chapter. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Chaotic encryption algorithm; H.264 video; Video encryption; Video security",""

A detailed security analysis on an IEC61850 automated substation is peformed initially with a focus on the possible goals of the attacker. This is followed by the development of a scheme to audit the security of such a network. Security metrics are considered since they provide a tangible means of quantifying the security of a network. The proposed auditing scheme is tested by using it to audit the security of an IEC61850 network. The results are then compared with two other metric schemesthe mean time to compromise (MTTC) metric and the VEA-bility metric, which are used for auditing conventional computer networks. The input data for both metrics are obtained by using a network security tool to scan the IEDs of the network.

In the educational environment, which includes various areas of computer-supported learning, the scope of security ranges from human-centred to technology-centred issues. Both of these deal with information security in a socio-technical educational context, the first emphasizing human activity and the latter IT.

The terms Network Security and Information Security are often used interchangeably. Network Security is generally taken as providing protection at the boundaries of an organization by keeping out intruders (hackers). Information Security, however, explicitly focuses on protecting data resources from malware attack or simple mistakes by people within an organization by use of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) techniques. One of these techniques is to compartmentalize large networks with internal boundaries. Employees have to cross these boundaries and be authenticated when attempting to access protected information. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Computer crime; Internet protocols; Loss prevention; Personal computing; Semantic Web; Technical presentations; Continuous monitoring; Data resources; Information security; Internal boundary; Large networks; Malware attacks; Network administrator; Network infrastructure; Networking protocols; Network security"

Security policies, in particular acceptable use policies, have traditionally been written with a strategy of deterrence in mind, but in practice they rely mostly on deontological ethics, i.e. employees doing the right thing, to work. As far back as 1990, evidence has been reported of a widening socio-technical gap, where employees no longer always act according to expected social norms in an organisation. This change in moral behaviour is reducing the effectiveness of acceptable use policies in an organisation. In this paper, an alternative approach to the development of security policies is proposed to encourage ethical decision making based on consequential ethics. Acceptable use policies will need to distinguish between guidelines, standards and procedures, and guidelines will need to be written in such a way that the policy continuously acknowledges that employees are no longer expected to blindly follow these guidelines. And, as acceptable use policies can no longer cover all the possible risks related to an employee's behaviour, the policy will need to emphasise both explicitly an implicitly that employees are expected to make an ethical judgement on all their actions that may possibly endanger the organisation's security. This will in turn have positive effects on the usability and suitability of the acceptable use policy to the organisation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

First, a mathematical model of the multi-track separating theory was built, and a new type of track called the binary XOR group circular track was defined. Then, a new separating algorithm for the kind of track was proposed, by which the problem of solving the element that performs XOR operation with the base track can be converted into deciding the eigen bit mode of the track. It proved to be correct in theory and improved the operability greatly. Finally, the algorithm was applied to the shared-access host number detection to prove its effectiveness.

The Net Present Value (NPV), and discounted Return on Investment (dRoI) models are proposed for the execution of cost-benefit analysis. Since fuzzy results are in the form of a complex nonlinear representation, and do not always provide a totally ordered set in the same way that crisp numbers do, the current paper approximates the resulting fuzzy profitability indexes by a triangular fuzzy number initially, and then uses the Mellin Transform to obtain the means and variances of the triangle fuzzy numbers in order to determine their relative ranking in a decision-making process. The performances of the proposed fuzzy economic models are verified by considering their application to a practical illustration. These investigations not only confirm that the results of the fuzzy economic models are consistent with those of the conventional crisp models, but also demonstrate that the proposed models are more flexible, intelligent and computationally efficient compared to the traditional crisp engineering economics. The developed models represent readily implemented feasibility analysis tools for use in the arena of uncertain economic decision-making.","Decision-making; Fuzzy mathematics; Fuzzy ranking; Information security; Risk management","Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Economics; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy sets; Information science; Investments; Models; Profitability; Risk analysis; Risk management; Computationally efficient; Crisp models; Crisp numbers; Decision making process; Developed model; Economic decision model; Economic decision-making; Economic feasibilities; Economic models; Engineering economics; Feasibility analysis; Fuzzy economics; Fuzzy mathematics; Fuzzy rankings; Information security; Information security investment; Mellin transform; Net present value; Ordered set; Relative rankings; Return on investments; Triangle fuzzy numbers; Triangular fuzzy numbers; Security of data"

During most practical cooperating processes, both developers and administrators won't abandon the legacy systems of entitlement management and access control completely, but expect to hold the balance between authorization opening and rebuilding costs. Just in such background, authorization interoperation becomes a representative research method. From multidimensional perspectives, this paper focuses on carding and dissecting the progress and evolution of the theory and technology of interoperation. For example: from the perspective of inter-domain cooperative architecture, the interopertion can be divided into loosely-coupled pattern and federated pattern; from the perspective of security detection mechanism, it can be divided into mediator-based scenario and mediator-free scenario; from the perspective of modeling approach, it can be divided into arbitrary management advance modeling and request-driven real time modeling; from the perspective of assistive technology, it relates to trust-based, risk-based and semantic based assistance, etc; and from the perspective of policy integration level, it can be separated into authorization management oriented integration and resource aggregation oriented integration. For every typical scheme, the survey elaborates the basic theory and applicable scene, and analyzes technical features and limitation through comparison.

A survey based on AHP methodology was conducted to obtain decision maker preferences. Instead of relying on dedicated AHP software, we prefer to clearly demonstrate the process of AHP calculations by using Open Office Calc in data analysis. The aims are to show the applicability of open source software in handling AHP decision making problem and to help decision makers in understanding AHP data analysis procedures without relying on proprietary software.

But the process of increasing the computational effort needed by an adversary in order to break the provided security has a dramatic impact on the performance of the cryptographic application and sets a severe limit to the proposed security level due to the computational and data intensive operations which require extensive processing power and storage resources. Our solution is to link cryptography to an architecture specially designed to satisfy these demands, namely Grid computing, which has known an increasing popularity in recent years. The wide majority of cryptographic algorithms are designed sequentially and are not ready to embrace the enhancement brought by advances in parallel and distributed computing technologies and hence can not take the plunge to a higher performance level through parallel execution without a proper adjustment process. This paper presents our results on adjusting and implementing several well known cryptographic algorithms on a Grid infrastructure focusing on the achieved performance improvements.","Bloc cipher; Cryptographic algorithms; gLite middleware; Grid; Hash function; Parallel execution; Private key; Public key; Random number generator; Stream cipher","Computational complexity; Grid computing; Hash functions; Hydraulics; Middleware; Number theory; Public key cryptography; Random number generation; Robotics; Bloc cipher; Cryptographic algorithms; gLite middleware; Grid; Parallel executions; Private key; Public keys; Random number generators; Stream Ciphers; Security of data"

In the phase of enrollment, it firstly irreversibly converts the feature value extracted from the original fingerprint image into a string of binary sequence with a fixed length by BioHashing, and then binds the key to the binary sequence by the Fuzzy Commitment scheme to generate a cancellable fingerprint template which can be stored in the database or a smartcard. In the phase of identification, the error correcting code is employed to regain the binding key from the cancelable template with the help of query fingerprint images. If using the DCFT method, even if all the data in the database is stolen, none of the original fingerprint biometric information will be leaked. Moreover, the stored template can be regenerated by changing the random matrix in BioHashing or the bingding key, so that the leakage of information is not available in verification. It avoids the permanent security threat caused by non-changeability of fingerprint. In the end, the simulation result is showed to illuminate the validity of the DCFT method.","BioHashing; Biometric template protection; Error correcting code; FingerCode; Fingerprint recognition; Key binding","Binary sequences; Biometrics; Image processing; Smart cards; BioHashing; Biometric template protection; Error correcting code; FingerCode; Fingerprint Recognition; Key binding; Security of data"

Security is hard for users, administrators, and developers to understand, making it all too easy to use, configure, or operate systems in ways that are inadvertently insecure. Moreover, security and privacy technologies originally were developed in a context in which system administrators had primary responsibility for security and privacy protections and in which the users tended to be sophisticated. Today, the user base is much wider--including the vast majority of employees in many organizations and a large fraction of households--but the basic models for security and privacy are essentially unchanged. Security features can be clumsy and awkward to use and can present significant obstacles to getting work done. As a result, cybersecurity measures are all too often disabled or bypassed by the users they are intended to protect. Similarly, when security gets in the way of functionality, designers and administrators deemphasize it. The result is that end users often engage in actions, knowingly or unknowingly, that compromise the security of computer systems or contribute to the unwanted release of personal or other confidential information.

The P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences) proposed by W3C is a method for protecting user privacy, however, it is not flexible enough to meet the needs of the interaction between users and sites, this technology has not received wide spread support. In order to overcome the shortcomings of P3P and achieve flexibility in accommodating the privacy interaction between users and sites, this paper proposes an auto privacy negotiation mechanism, and researches the privacy negotiation model and algorithm. The mechanism uses the Pareto-based genetic algorithms to implement auto privacy negotiation and uses the MATLAB 2009A to carry out the experiments. The results of the experiments showed the algorithm supported bilateral multi-issue automated negotiation, and the negotiation time was very short, thus confirming the feasibility of applying the genetic algorithms to privacy negotiation. ©2010 IEEE.","Genetic algorithms; Negotiation; P3P; Privacy","Experiments; Internet; Security of data; Automated negotiations; Multi-issue; Negotiation; Negotiation mechanism; Negotiation models; Online privacy; P3P; Personal privacy; Platform for privacy preferences; Privacy; User privacy; Wide spreads; Genetic algorithms"

A shared key is established by authenticated key-exchange(AKE) protocol and used with message authentication code(MAC). By the way, the existing solutions for authentication introduce non-negligible computational overheads such as modular exponentiation.

Stated beliefs about deception and deceptive messages or incidents are content analyzed in a sample of 324 computer-mediated communications. Relevant stated beliefs are obtained through systematic sampling and querying of the blogosphere based on 80 English words commonly used to describe deceptive incidents. Deception is conceptualized broader than lying and includes a variety of deceptive strategies: falsification, concealment (omitting material facts) and equivocation (dodging or skirting issues). The stated beliefs are argued to be valuable toward the creation of a unified multi-faceted ontology of deception, stratified along several classificatory facets such as (1) contextual domain (e.g., personal relations, politics, finances & insurance), (2) deception content (e.g., events, time, place, abstract notions), (3) message format (e.g., a complaint: they lied to us, a victim story: I was lied to or tricked, or a direct accusation: you're lying), and (4) deception variety, each tied to particular verbal cues (e.g., misinforming, scheming, misrepresenting, or cheating).

Not only businesses depend on the Internet for all types of electronic transactions, but more and more home users are also experiencing the immense benefit of the Internet. However, this dependence and use of the Internet bring new and dangerous risks. This is due to increasing attempts from unauthorised third parties to compromise private information for their own benefit - the whole wide area of cyber crime. It is therefore essential that all users understand the risks of using Internet, the importance of securing their personal information and the consequences if this is not done properly. It is well known that home users are specifically vulnerable, and that cyber criminals have such users squarely in their target. This vulnerability of home users is due to many factors, but one of the most important one is the fact that such home users in many cases are not aware of the risks of using the Internet, and often venture into cyber space without any awareness preparation for this journey. This paper specifically investigates the position of the home user, and proposes a new model, the E-Awareness Model (E-AM), in which home users can be forced to acquaint themselves with the risks involved in venturing into cyber space. The E-AM consists of two components: the awareness component housed in the E-Awareness Portal, and the enforcement component. This model proposes a way to improve information security awareness among home users by presenting some information security content and enforcing the absorption of this content. The main difference between the presented model and other existing information security awareness models is that in the presented model the acquiring/absorption of the awareness content is compulsory - the user is forced to proceed via the E-Awareness Portal without the option of bypassing it. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

XML document is used as cover-media in XML document information hiding algorithms. A new algorithm of XML document information hiding based on equal element is presented, which overcomes the shortcoming of imperceptibility, robustness and hiding capacity of traditional XML document information hiding algorithms. According to the embedded rule, firstly, the algorithm turns secret message to a decimal integer, and then created equal element through sub-elements' permutation and combination. According to mapping function between integer and equal element, the integer is embedded into the XML document by replacing the element with its equal element. The experimental results show that the algorithm does not change the size of XML document, and has good imperceptibility and robustness. The embedding capacity of the algorithm gets better increase than traditional XML document information hiding algorithms. So the algorithm could be used to covert communication and protect the content of XML documents. © 2010 IEEE.","Equal element; Information hiding; Sub-element; XML","Algorithms; Computer graphics; Computer science; Copyrights; Information technology; XML; Copyright protections; Covert communications; Digital multimedia; Digital Objects; Embedding capacity; Equal element; General observers; Hiding capacity; Hot spot; Information hiding; Information security; Mapping functions; Secret messages; Sub-element; Security of data"

For example, on 7th July in 2009, a DDoS attack occurred against 48 web sites in South Korea and U.S.A. In this attack, the attack traffic pattern and the botnet construction methods are different from that of previous version. Due to the differences of the attack patterns, the 7.7 DDoS attack was not detected easily. These days, such new types of sophisticated attacks occur and it's not easy to detect those attacks effectively. In fact, it's been more than ten years since DDoS attacks discovered in late 1990s. However, DDoS attack is still one of the biggest threats in Internet infrastructure and IT environment. It is because almost all the DDoS defense techniques are not focused on general characteristics and infrastructure but on specific characteristics in each attack. In order to develop a general purpose DDoS defense technology, all the attack process and general characteristics should be analyzed. Furthermore, based on the each attack phases and location of network topology also have to be analyzed. For that, in this paper, we show a general DDoS attack process and each phase in this process. For each phase, we propose DDoS attack prevention requirements and finally suggest the integrated DDoS attack defense infrastructure.

Design/methodology/approach: An empirical survey, using a self-administered questionnaire, is conducted to explore and evaluate the current status and the main features of ISG in the Saudi environment. The questionnaire is developed based on ISG guidelines for boards of directors and executive management issued by the Information Technology (IT) Governance Institute and other related materials available in the literature. A total of 167 valid questionnaires are collected and processed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 16. Findings: The results of the study reveal that although the majority of Saudi organizations recognize the importance of ISG as an integrant factor for the success of IT and corporate governance, most of them have no clear information security strategies or written information security policy statements. The majority of Saudi organizations have no disaster recovery plans to deal with information security incidents and emergencies; information security roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined and communicated. The results also show that alignment between ISG and the organization's overall business strategy is relatively poor and not adequately implemented. The results also show that risk assessment procedures are not adequately and effectively implemented, ISG is not a regular item in the board's agenda, and there are no properly functioning ISG processes or performance-measuring systems in the majority of Saudi organizations. Accordingly, appropriate actions should be taken to improve implementing and measuring the ISG performance in Saudi organizations. Originality/value: From a practical standpoint, managers and practitioners alike stand to gain from the findings of this study. The results of the paper enable them to better understand and evaluate ISG and to champion IT development for business success in Saudi organizations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0968-5227.","Data security; Governance; Information management; Saudi Arabia; Self-assessment","Disaster prevention; Information management; Information technology; Risk assessment; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Assessment procedure; Boards of directors; Business strategy; Business success; Corporate governance; Current status; Data security; Design/methodology/approach; Disaster recovery plan; Empirical studies; Executive management; Governance; Information security; Information security governance; Information technologies (it); Measuring systems; Roles and responsibilities; Saudi Arabia; Self-administered questionnaire; Self-assessment; Statistical packages; Written information; Security of data"

In order to understand the structure of twisted light, it is useful to start with an ordinary light beam with zero twist, namely a plane wave. Another major difference is that the light in a twisted light beam does not propagate directly forward, parallel to the beam axis as in an ordinary light beam, but tends to move sideways in opposite directions on opposite sides of the beam. The net result is that the twisted light beam carries orbital angular momentum (OAM). The property of quantum entanglement allows quantum cryptography to become viable. For two photons that are entangled, only two parties are allowed to take part in the communication process. Any additional eavesdropper would destroy one of the photons and cause all but one of the realities to vanish.

Unfortunately, despite the investments made in process improvement, there is still no guarantee that the developed software products are protected from attacks or do not present security vulnerabilities. As soon as software products continue to present security flaws and be compromised by attacks, the Systems Security Engineering - Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM) becomes the de facto model to structure a software security approach. Moreover, security best practices, practical experience or international standards, like ISO/IEC 15408, should also be considered to support security engineering as they propose activities that can be adapted to enhance security in a software development process and contribute towards the overall software security. This paper proposes a security engineering approach to support software security through a specialized process that helps develop more secure software, entitled Process to Support Software Security (PSSS).

Real-valued Negative selection algorithms(RNSA) of AIS generate their detector sets based on the points of self data. Self data is regarded as the normal pattern of behavior of the monitored system. This paper provide a new fault detection method based on RNSA of artificial immunity. It can effectively overcome the deficiency of the various fault detection methods of today that cannot implement fault detections because there are only normal samples and not enough fault samples and short of the function of continuous learning. The test result shows that, by increasing a certain number of training samples, the accuracy of fault diagnosis has made great changes.

Within the ISIE framework, the derived models are obtained from the root model by extracting the necessary (for a given particular problem) partial model and its subsequent regulated modification: supplement, generalization, evolving etc. With these operations, the derived models, in general, remain coordinated with the root model and the corresponding IS standard that ensures the possibility of reuse of every particular derived model in other tasks.

This is a quasi quantum secure direct communication protocol, since it closely unites the quantum key distribution and the classical communication. In the protocol, a key is distributed between both parties participating in communication using EPR pairs, the secret message is sent through classical public channel and the both are closely combined. The protocol applies a braid-based key agreement protocol to let both parties share a secret random number, whose size and magnitude are undecided in advance. It is used to perform all the authentications of the communication. So the communication is simplified. The security of the proposed protocol is based on the no-cloning theorem and the fact that the p-th root finding problem on braid groups is intractable even on quantum computers, as well as classical computers. © 2010 IEEE.","Bell states; Braid-based key agreement protocol; Information security; Quantum cryptography; Quantum key distribution; Quantum secure direct communication","Authentication; Bells; Cloning; Communication; Computer science; Information technology; Network protocols; Network security; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Weaving; Bell state; Information security; Key agreement protocol; Quantum key distribution; Quantum secure direct communication; Quantum cryptography"

Based on the experimental results with MPEG2/AES-CCM software, we confirm that the multicore-based solution can improve the energy efficiency of a singlecore-based solution by a factor of 22 under the real-time constraint.","Component; Energy efficiency; Information security; Multicore-based embedded systems; Privacy protection; Video surveillance system","Copyrights; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Monitoring; Real time systems; Security of data; Sensors; Component; Information security; Multi core; Privacy protection; Video surveillance systems; Security systems"

Traditionally, anti-virus products use signature matching to detect malware, but the drawback is that they can not detect new and unknown malware. Recent studies showed that the use of machine learning can successfully detect new and unknown malware, but the limitation of this technique is its high false rate. The performance of machine learning is influenced by two main factors: (1) the features used to represent the instances; and (2) the algorithm used to generate classifier. In this paper, we improved the accuracy of machine learning from these two factors. On the one hand we combined features extracted from both content-based and behavior-based analyses to represent the instances; on the other hand, we used classifier ensembles to replace individual classifier. Based on our methodology, a hybrid-classifier was implemented to classify unknown executables as either malicious or benign.

Various approaches have been devised to protect and transfer such information securely. However, as technology and communications advance and information management systems become more and more powerful and distributed, the problem has taken on new and more complex dimensions and has become a major challenge. The widespread use of wired and wireless communication networks, internet, web applications and computing has increased the gravity of the problem. Organizations are totally dependent on reliable, secure and fault-tolerant systems, communications, applications and information bases. Unfortunately, serious security and privacy breaches still occur every day, creating an absolute necessity to provide secure and safe information security systems through the use of firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (ID/PSs), encryption, authentication and other hardware and software solutions. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This survey presents an up-to-date comprehensive state of the art overview of ID/PSs based on risk analysis, a description of what ID/PSs are, the functions they serve, its two primary types and different methods of ID that may employ. Findings: As security incidents are increasing and are more aggressive, ID/PSs have also become increasingly necessary, they compliment the arsenal of security measures, working in conjunction with other information security tools such as malware filters and firewalls. Because of a growing number of intrusion events and also because the internet and local networks together with user applications have become so ubiquitous, the need arises to use sophisticated advanced techniques from autonomic computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence and data mining to make intelligent/smart ID/PSs. Originality/value: This paper perceives the requirements of developing a new detection mechanism to detect known and unknown threats, based on intelligent techniques such as machine learning and autonomic computing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0968-5227.","Data security; Information management; Risk management","Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Cryptography; Fault tolerant computer systems; Filtration; Information management; Internet; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Occupational risks; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Surveys; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless telecommunication systems; Autonomic Computing; Complex dimensions; Data flow; Data security; Design/methodology/approach; Detection mechanism; Fault-tolerant systems; Hardware and software; Information basis; Information exchanges; Information management systems; Information security; Information security systems; Intelligent techniques; Intrusion detection and prevention systems; Intrusion events; Local networks; Machine-learning; Malwares; Security and privacy; Security incident; Security measure; State of the art; WEB application; Wired and wireless communications; Network security"

This paper is aimed at proposing a novel attack with improved performance indices with the following implications: 1) employing higher order statistics from a curvelet sub-band image representation that offers better discrimination ability for detecting stego anomalies in images, as compared to other conventional wavelet transforms; 2) increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the system by the feature reduction phase; 3) realizing the system using an efficient classification engine, a neuro-C4. 5 classifier, which provides better classification rate.

Information Security (IS) is to protect our important information assets from accidental or deliberate damages. Cyber Security (CS) is a whole set of procedures and systems providing protection of computer systems and networks from the intentional and unintentional damages or dangers in the cyberspace through services like confidentiality, integrity, authentication, availability, nonrepudiation, auditing, and digital signature. To counter the increasing cyber terrorism threats, we need predictive calculation of cyber attacks occurrences. We can do this by giving mathematical models for the elements of CS systems. Researchers have suggested some models for the quantification of CS, however, the existing models have either enforced only qualitative measures or the quantification models lack modeling features and without validation with the realistic data. There is a requirement for a unified model for the quantification of CS that considers majority of the parameters and services for it and which should be validated with realistic data. We propose a quantification model of cyber security, which considers most of the CS parameters. This is a generalized model, which is customizable enough to be used in multitude implementation environments. The proposed model is simulated and validated with an example of real life data for the SZABIST Islamabad Campus email server.

The most widely used class of RFID tags is the class 1 tag because it offers identification functionality at low cost. Class 1 tags have limited computational power and memory resources. Due to these limitations, common authentication protocols such as AES cannot be implemented on the class 1 tags.

The essence of low-carbon economy is to fundamentally abandon human's dependence on fossil energy through technological and managerial innovation. Featuring in low energy consumption, low emission and low pollution, a sustainable development path shall be established to decrease the greenhouse gas emission, such as CO2. In China, urban cities receive about 75% of the total carbon emission of the whole country. Currently, urban management in China is facing a variety of difficulties and problems, including departments' redundancy, feeble coordination, out-dated management pattern, and low management efficiency as well. Through research, we find out that it is crucial to control the carbon emission in cities in a bid to establish a low-carbon and ecological development pattern. Moreover, serious departmentalization is the most difficulty point for urban management. Poor information sharing and coordination both obstruct the management procedure. In view of the research, we believe the key for urban management in China is to solve the information isolation island problem, creating a more coordinated and efficient cooperation among departments. A digital urban management pattern shall also be adopted in China, which will improve the quality of decision-making and urban management level. Furthermore, the integration of networking industry and other information industries has to be strengthened to train modern managerial talents and develop China's own digital management system with property rights.

Efficiency and effectiveness of information security policy is crucial, especially when dealing with situations that affect the status and life-history of the patient. In addition, the rules and procedures to follow, in order to provide confidentiality of sensitive information, have to focus on management of events on any table of the HIS. On the other hand, control and statement constraints, as well as events and security auditing techniques, play also an important role, due to the heterogeneity of healthcare professionals' roles, actions and physical locations, as well as to the specific characteristics and needs of the healthcare organizations. This chapter will first explore issues in managing access control and security of healthcare information by reviewing the possible threats and vulnerabilities as well as the basic attributes of the hospital's security plan.

Escalating increase in pervasive computing devices in an increasingly wireless networked environment has created a conducive breeding infrastructure for security and privacy breach attacks in e-Healthcare.

It would seem to be logical that such a framework would have based on a convergence of the key drivers to e-Healthcare information privacy and security.

Different generic data encryption standards, such as DES, RSA, AES, have been developed. These encryption standards provide high level of security to the encrypted data. However, they are not very efficient in the encryption of multimedia contents due to the large volume of digital image/video data. In order to address this issue, different image/video encryption methodologies have been developed. These methodologies encrypt only the key parameters of image/video data instead of encrypting it as a bitstream. Joint compressionencryption is a very promising direction for image/video encryption. Nowadays, researchers start to utilize information hiding techniques to enhance the security level of data encryption methodologies. Information hiding conceals not only the content of the secret message, but also its very existence. In terms of the amount of data to be embedded, information hiding methodologies can be classified into low bitrate and high bitrate algorithms. In terms of the domain for embedding, they can be classified into spatial domain and transform domain algorithms. In this chapter, we have reviewed various data encryption standards, image/video encryption algorithms, and joint compression-encryption methodologies. Besides, we have also presented different categories of information hiding methodologies as well as data embedding strategies for digital image/video contents.

The aim of this paper is to present a quantitative framework as an alternative way of analysing IT security investments in a banking environment in order to address the two issues mentioned above. A two step framework is proposed. The first step utilizes a cluster analysis (CA) technique and the second step employs a linear programming technique called data envelopment analysis (DEA). The purpose of the clustering step is to ensure that evaluations are carried out in groups of homogenous bank branches while the purpose of the DEA model is to determine which of the branches make efficient use of the IT security resources available to them.

Computer hacks are usually addressed through technical means thus ensuring that perpetrators are unable to exploit system vulnerabilities. We however argue that a computer hack is a result of different events in a heterogeneous network embodying human and non-human actors. Hence a secure organizational environment is one that is characterized by 'stability' and 'social order', which is a result of negotiations and alignment of interests among different actants. The argument is conducted through a case study. Our findings reveal not only the usefulness of ANT in developing an understanding of the (in)security environment at the case study organization, but also the ability of ANT to identify differences in interests among actants. At a practical level, our analysis suggests three principles that management needs to pay attention to in order to prevent future security breaches. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2010.","Actor network theory; Computer hack; Information security; IS security","Heterogeneous networks; Actor network theory; Information security managements; IS security; Security breaches; Security environments; Social order; System vulnerability; Security of data"

Individuals or groups compete for limited resources using a variety of strategies, the most effective of which are reused and refined in later 'generations'. Traditionally this behavior has made detection of malicious entities very difficult because 1) recognition systems are often built on exact matching to a pattern that can only be 'learned' after a malicious entity reveals itself and 2) the enormous volume and variation in benign entities is an overwhelming source of previously unseen entities that often confound detectors. To turn the tables of complexity on the would-be attackers, we have developed a method for mapping the sequence of behaviors in which cyber entities engage to strings of text and analyze these strings using modified bioinformatics algorithms. Bioinformatics algorithms optimize the alignment between text strings even in the presence of mismatches, insertions or deletions and do not require an a priori definition of the patterns one is seeking. Nor do they require any type of exact matching. This allows the data itself to suggest meaningful patterns that are conserved between cyber entities. We demonstrate this method on data generated from live network traffic. The impact of this approach is that it can rapidly calculate similarity measures of previously unseen cyber entities in terms of well-characterized entities. These measures may also be used to organize large collections of data into families, making it possible to identify motifs indicative of each family. © 2010 ACM.","bioinformatics; BLAST; cybersecurity; network security","Bioinformatics; Pattern recognition systems; BLAST; Cyber security; Exact matching; Live network traffic; Malicious entity; Organic systems; Recognition systems; Similarity measure; Text string; Network security"

Security is important for several reasons, most of which have a foundation in economics. Firstly, equipment is expensive to get, install, and integrate into the infrastructure of an organization. Secondly, the operations of an organization are based on the applied technology infrastructure, which means that disruption of operations quickly turns into unnecessary costs and, when applicable, potential loss of revenue. The adoption of digital patient records, increased regulation, supplier consolidation, and the increasing demand for information, highlights the need for better information security. Electronic health (e-Health) has become an important area of concern. A comprehensive EHR (Electronic Health Record) at the point of care could be created by collecting and sharing data among all sites at which patient receives care, as well as by incorporating information supplied by the patient. One of the greatest incentives to adopting EHRs will be reaching a critical mass of information sharing investors in health care information technology. In this work the authors examine the security properties of the EHR, with a special emphasis on software reliability. The authors focus on modelling and studying the reliability feature of the EHR. Special attention is given on exploiting the mathematical foundations of reliability modelling in a service-oriented architecture.

Due to the rapid growth of computer community, many network architectures are becoming multi-server based. Recently, there have been many remote password authentication schemes proposed for securing multi-server environments. These schemes used either a nonce or a timestamp technique to prevent the replay attack. However, using the nonce technique to withstand the replay attack is potentially susceptible to the man-in-the-middle attack. Alternatively, when employing the timestamp method to secure remote password authentication, it will encounter the difficulty of implementing time synchronization. In order to solve both the above two issues, this paper proposes a self-verified timestamp technique to not only securely achieve password authenticated key agreement but also avoid the difficulty of implementing time synchronization in multi-server environments. On the other hand, the function of service period management can allow servers to update the list of illegal users easily and periodically. Therefore, we also further develop the scheme of service period management in this paper. © 2010 IEEE.","Information security; Internet key agreement; Password authentication; Smart card","Computer architecture; Internet; Network architecture; Security of data; Servers; Smart cards; Information security; Man in the middle attacks; Multi-server; Multi-server environment; Password authentication; Password-authenticated key agreement; Rapid growth; Remote user authentication; Replay attack; Secure remote passwords; Time synchronization; Time-stamp; Timestamp technique; Authentication"

An organization needs to identify which ones to respond to. The selection, implementetion and maintenance of information security countermeasures requires a complex combination of organisational policies, functions and processes, which form Information Security Management. This chapter examines the role of current information security management practices in addressing the insider threat. Most approaches focus on frameworks for regulating insider behaviour and do not allow for the various cultural responses to the regulatory and compliance framework. Such responses are not only determined by enforcement of policies and awareness programs, but also by various psychological and organisational factors at an individual or group level. Crime theories offer techniques that focus on such cultural responses and can be used to enhance the information security management design. The chapter examines the applicability of several crime theories and concludes that they can contribute in providing additional controls and redesign of information security management processes better suited to responding to the insider threat. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","",""

This contemporary paradigm creates openings for potentially harmful unanticipated information security incidents of both a criminal or civil nature, with the potential to cause considerable direct and indirect damage to smaller businesses. Electronic evidence is fundamental to the successful handling of such incidents. If an organisation does not prepare proactively for such incidents it is highly likely that important relevant digital evidence will not be available. Not being able to respond effectively could be extremely damaging to smaller companies, as they are unable to absorb losses as easily as larger organisations. In order to prepare smaller businesses for incidents of this nature, the implementation of Digital Forensic Readiness policies and procedures is necessitated. Numerous varying factors such as the perceived high cost, as well as the current lack of forensic skills, make the implementation of Digital Forensic Readiness appear difficult if not infeasible for smaller organisations. In order to solve this problem it is necessary to develop a scalable and flexible framework for the implementation of Digital Forensic Readiness based on the individual risk profile of a small to medium enterprise (SME). This paper aims to determine, from literature, the concepts of Digital Forensic Readiness and how they apply to SMEs.

Although this documentation is distributed recently usually IT supported it is almost felt as additional workload with a little or no advantage, it is not totally corresponding with the lived processes. Therefore it is hardly used as reference book for solving job problems and questions. It is not basis for a structured, systematic regulation management to improve the organization. Based on this situation we prepared the regulations and system documentation according to media-pedagogical and didactical principles and published it on organizational document learning and knowledge system based on constructivist theory.

The RSA, the widely used public key algorithm and other public key algorithms may not guarantee that the cipher text is fully secured. As an alternative approach to handling ASCII value of the text in the cryptosystem, a magic square of order 16 equivalent to ASCII set generated from two different approaches is thought of in this work. It attempts to enhance the efficiency by providing add-on security to the cryptosystem. Here, encryption/decryption is based on numerals generated by magic square rather than ASCII values. This proposed work provides another layer of security to any public key algorithms. Since, this model is acting as a wrapper to a public-key algorithm, it ensures that the security is enhanced.

Universities offer Internet services to users, store personal information of learners, staff, conference and attendees. which exposes them to potential risks and legal liabilities. Failure to ensure compliance with information security laws poses significant financial and reputation risk and may invite serious scrutiny of university activities by law enforcement bodies [24]. While universities have sought various measures to achieve compliance (e.g. self-regulations, security policies, staff/student handbooks, public relation campaigns, Web and email reminders and audits.), these have had limited success in influencing user behaviours. The rate of electronic abuse and lack of compliance with policies is simply on the rise. The August 2009 EDUCAUSE Review indicates that security remains one of the top strategic issues facing higher education institutions [2]. [20] claims that half of all personal identity breaches occur in higher education. The recording industry and motion picture associations are increasingly holding institutions liable for illegal downloading of copyright materials [11] and students have also been accused of privacy violations [8]. So, what makes compliance with policies and regulations in universities difficult and how can compliance be measured and achieved effectively? This study examines the factors that influence compliance with security policies and regulations in universities. First, some key regulations governing information security in South Africa are introduced, followed by a review of the security environment and compliance behaviours in universities. A framework aligning regulatory requirements with control standards is developed to guide compliance behaviours in universities. ©2010 IEEE.","IS security compliance; Security regulations & policies, universities, control frameworks","Behavioral research; Computer crime; Crime; Education; Internet; Motion pictures; Public relations; Regulatory compliance; Security systems; Societies and institutions; Computer security; Control standards; Copyright materials; Educational institutions; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Information security; Information security laws; Internet services; Legal liability; Personal identity; Personal information; Potential risks; Privacy violation; Regulatory requirements; Security compliance; Security environments; Security policy; Security regulations; South Africa; Strategic issues; User behaviour; Security of data"

We are in a period of aggressive technological growth to which there is no foreseeable end. New technologies, such as Web 2.0 and cloud computing, are emerging at an exponential rate, and as a consequence, security threats, controls, and standards are iteratively evolving. As yet, we do not know the security and privacy implications that such a rapid and wide uptake of cloud computing, and other multi-user virtual environment initiatives, and Web 2.0 technologies, will bring. In no way is this cause to panic, instead it is cause to focus on self-education, employee-education, and awareness. To put it simply, these offer our best defense to security threats. By being educated, aware, and vigilant, the majority of threats are nullified, as they are designed to prey upon those who rely on trust when reading emails, visiting Websites, and accessing site content, when navigating the World Wide Web. For example, there are millions of users who are completely unaware of threats, such as phishing, and other forms of Internet-based fraud. More than ever before, the onus is on the individual, both at home and in the workplace, to be responsible for maintaining best practice techniques, while utilizing digital resources to ensure that information security, individual privacy, and applicable legislation are not breached.

As such, the rise of computer related offenses pose a threat to the fundamental aspects of e-democracy and e-governance. Digital forensics are a key component for protecting and enabling the underlying (e-)democratic values and therefore forensic readiness should be considered in an e-democratic setting. This position paper commences from the observation that the density of compliance and potential litigation activities is monotonically increasing in modern organizations, as rules, legislative regulations and policies are being constantly added to the corporate environment. Forensic practices seem to be departing from the niche of law enforcement and are becoming a business function and infrastructural component, posing new challenges to the security professionals. Having no a priori knowledge on whether a security related event or corporate policy violation will lead to litigation, we advocate that computer forensics need to be applied to all investigatory, monitoring and auditing activities. This would result into an inflation of the responsibilities of the Information Security Officer. After exploring some commonalities and differences between IS audit and computer forensics, we present a list of strategic challenges the organization and, in effect, the IS security and audit practitioner will face. © 2010 Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Compliance; Computer forensics; e-discovery; IS audit","Computer crime; Crime; Laws and legislation; Business functions; Compliance; Corporate environment; Corporate policies; Digital forensic; E-democracy; e-discovery; E-governance; Forensic readiness; Information assurance; IS audit; Key component; Position papers; Priori knowledge; Regulations and policy; Security professionals; Strategic challenges; Computer forensics"

Information Assurance controls must be implemented throughout the grid, from large scale power generating facilities, through transmission and distribution systems, to Building Management Systems (BMS) & Home Area Networks (HAN). A precursor to determining the appropriate controls for any particular device is to determine the trust model within which these devices exist. This paper sets out to define a multi-level framework for a trust model to be used throughout the electrical grid. The model is based on two core principles: categorize cyber security requirements based on a subsystem's potential impact on the overall grid; and implement controls based on an assumed compromise of adjacent subsystems. From a Smart Grid Cyber Security perspective, rather than attempting to create an all encompassing enclave of trust, this model suggests that systems should be designed in ways which expect compromise of adjacent systems. An expansive sphere of implied trust will inevitably lead an expansive sphere of vulnerability. Having an expectation of compromise, of a lack of trust, would be preferable as it will require subsystems to implement independent, rather than dependent, cyber security controls. © 2010 ACM.","cyber security; information assurance; Smart Grid; standards; trust model","Intelligent buildings; Spheres; Building management system; Core principles; Cyber security; Electrical grids; High assurance; Home area network; Information assurance; Multi-level; Potential impacts; Sensors and actuators; Significant factors; Smart grid; Through transmission; Trust models; Security of data"

This chapter provides an overview of the information security and counterintelligence, the primary threats to information and intangible assets, identify the various types of information security vulnerabilities, reasonable risk mitigation and security measures, the role of the professional protection officer and security service providers in the protection of sensitive information and intangible assets. The counterintelligence activities include any measures taken to negate intelligence collection efforts against an organization or its people and may be defensive or offensive in nature. The threats to information and intangible assets may be intentional, natural, and inadvertent. The methods that comprise the threat to information assets cover the gamut from old, the time-tested techniques to new, and the innovative collection measures such as data mining, electronic eavesdropping, theft of hardcopy information, and theft of softcopy information/media. Technology, which is moving and advancing at an amazing pace, results in wonderful opportunities for information sharing, productivity, and accomplishment; however, it also represents a new paradigm for security risks. Following a thorough risk assessment, an orchestrated suite of security, legal, and management solutions are applied to the identified organizational risks. The protection officers play a key role in the protection of information and intangible assets, influence the reputation of an organization by presenting a highly competent and professional image, and acknowledge the nature of the assets that they are responsible for protecting. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This paper explores the hypothesis that employers want new hires skilled in ICT literacy, which includes navigating information effectively and using technology efficiently. Based on an ICT literacy framework for higher education, two surveys were created to assess the opinions of human resources (HR) consultants and business school faculty. HR consultants endorsed practically all elements of the framework as being important or essential for new hires. Especially valued were skills associated with information security, confidentiality, and ethical behavior. However, business school faculty did not report a corresponding focus on ICT literacy generally, or ethical/legal issues in particular, in their instruction. The results suggest that while ICT literacy does indeed appear to be among the key skills for today's workforce, much work must still be done to integrate these skills throughout the business school undergraduate curriculum. © 2010 Educational Testing Service.","higher education; human resources; information and communication technology (ICT) literacy; information literacy; schools of business",""

Although some flexibility has been achieved with the introduction of dynamic policies, these efforts have only addressed a fraction of the requirements necessary to secure today's enterprises. Currently, no feedback mechanisms are in place to evaluate the effectiveness or economic impacts of static or dynamic policy implementation. Here, we address the requirement for feedback and present a policy for the next generation. This is a policy that includes a dynamic feedback response to the effectiveness of changes. The structure of this new type of policy, called a ""management system"", is borrowed from discrete event system (DES) theory and functions as a control loop. A management system consists of four elements (control system, sensor, controller, and actuator) that are involved in a control law. Two types of management system can be defined. A simple management system (1st order management system) responds to and regulates only perturbations. An advanced management system (2nd order management system) has an overarching target function that influences the controller. This target function is usually economically oriented. Finally, we compare our new type of policy with two management systems that follows the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA cycle) model. We investigate the two PDCA cycle standards ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management System, ISMS) and BS 25999 (Business Continuity Management System, BCMS). We also show that the new type of policy can be applied to management systems based on a PDCA cycle. © 2010 IEEE.","1<sup>st</sup> order management system; 2<sup>nd</sup> order management system; Balance system; Control loop; Static/dynamic policies","Computer control; Control theory; Controllers; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Industrial management; Information technology; Remote control; Balance systems; Business continuity management; Control laws; Control loop; Discrete event systems; Dynamic feedback; Dynamic policy; Economic impacts; Feedback mechanisms; Information security; Information security management systems; ISO/IEC; Management systems; Order management; PDCA cycles; Plan do check acts; Static/dynamic policies; Target functions; Security of data"

Our schemes generate a secret One Time Pad (OTP) shared by the sender and the receiver, from a large number of public random bits produced by the sender or by an external source. Our schemes initially generate a small number of shared secret bits, using known techniques. We introduce a new method to expand a small number of shared bits to a much longer, shared key. Our schemes are tailored to the requirements of sensor nodes and wireless networks. They are simple, efficient to implement and take advantage of the fact that practical wireless protocols transmit data in frames, unlike previous protocols, which assume access to specific bits in a stream of data. Indeed, our main contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we construct schemes that are attractive in terms of simplicity, computational complexity, number of bits read from the shared random source and expansion factor of the initial key to the final shared key. On the other hand, we show how to transform any existing scheme for key exchange in BSM into a more efficient scheme in the number of bits it reads from the shared source, given that the source is transmitted in frames.","bounded storage model; information theoretic security; wireless network","Computational complexity; Information theory; Mobile computing; Network security; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless sensor networks; Bounded storage model; Expansion factors; External sources; Information security; Information-theoretic security; Key exchange; Limited storage; One time pads; Random bits; Random sequence; Random sources; Shared secrets; Transmit data; Wireless protocol; Wireless networks"

On the spacecraft, these security functions are implemented using on-board security units. Synchronization between the on-board security unit and ground control is achieved by using application layer services. Our contribution in this paper is the proposition of generic application layer services based on the European Packet Utilization Standard (PUS) standard, providing a common interface to implement mainly for key management but also other security-unit operations. Such a common interface reduces system development costs for new space missions and allows the development of interoperable on-board security unit hardware. © 2010 by ESA.","","Rock mechanics; Security of data; Space flight; Application layers; Common interfaces; Communication infrastructure; Key management; Security functions; Security requirements; Space missions; System development; Interoperability"

However it has traditionally been considered during the final stages of development, once the main components of the system have been developed and therefore provides solutions which are inappropriate for security integration. Software engineering has traditionally been separated from security engineering, and security issues have not usually been included in software engineering processes, activities, techniques, models, and so on. Furthermore, security engineering has not been aligned with information systems, and has focused rather on the definition of protocols, cryptographic algorithms, access control policies, etc. However, the scientific community is beginning to realize the importance of aligning software engineering and security engineering in order to develop more secure systems. Security in software engineering is a branch of research in which many contributions dealing with security integration from the early development stages have recently appeared. This chapter discusses some of the most interesting contributions in this area, and also provides a summary of our contributions through the development of various research lines dealing with different strategies to integrate security into information systems development as early in the development stages as is possible. © 2011, IGI Global.","",""

Social applications provide a convenient approach where users can communicate and share their personal information. However, privacy and information security have been concerned as a critical issue in development social applications. Policy-based management, which is a management approach, has been used to control the information access privilege. Users' policies are more flexible and ease to change.

In operating systems like Windows there is no security enforcement for code running in kernel mode and therefore such code always runs with maximum privileges. The principle of least privilege therefore demands the use of a user mode solutions when given the choice between a kernel mode and user mode solution if the two solutions provide the same results. Discussions in this paper will be restricted to OSI model levels five and above. This paper describes the SAML delegation framework in the context of a large enclave-based architecture currently being implemented by the US Air Force. Benefits of the framework include increased flexibility to handle a number of different delegation business scenarios, decreased complexity of the solution, and greater accountability with only a modest amount of additional infrastructure required.","Attribution; Delegation; Enterprise; Information security; Information sharing; Least privilege","Industry; Security of data; Attribution; Business scenario; Code running; Delegation; Increased flexibility; Information sharing; Least privilege; Security enforcement; Information analysis"

Clustering is a principal data discovery technique in data mining that segregates a dataset into subsets or clusters so that data values in the same cluster have some common characteristics or attributes. A number of clustering techniques have been proposed in the past by many researchers that can identify arbitrary shaped cluster; where a cluster is defined as a dense region separated by the low-density regions and among them DBSCAN is a prime density-based clustering algorithm. DBSCAN is capable of discovering clusters of any arbitrary shape and size in databases which even include noise and outliers. Many researchers have attempted to overcome certain deficiencies in the original DBSCAN like identifying patterns within datasets of varied densities and its high computational complexity; hence a number of augmented forms of DBSCAN algorithm are available. We present an incremental density-based clustering technique which is based on the fundamental DBSCAN clustering algorithm to enhance its computational complexity.

It also creates new possibilities for conducting antagonistic, criminal and hazardous activities by using the Internet. A qualified cyber attack against an opponent's critical information infrastructure can within very short period of time lead to effects in a country's security policy. One area of great concerns is malicious hacking and hacktivism. The paper discusses the escalation of conflict on the Internet between different kinds of hacker groups fuelled by political, religious and national manifestations that tend to increase over time. The level and intensity of the activities are governed by recent incidents whereas conflicts are spreading from the physical sphere into cyber space. Symbols of different kinds are often used as tools for escalating conflicts. Whenever a cyber conflict is initiated a situation develops where different parties are willing to help either side. Unholy alliances form between disparate groups of people that could come from all over the world. The conflicts boost on various internet forums with everything from rumours and accusations from one part towards another to directed cyber attacks on a large scale. Misleading information is continuously disseminated with the purpose to create antagonism. In the text several examples are given on cyber antagonism with malicious hackings and defacement attacks that has developed from the physical sphere. For instance the infected debate of the Mohamed Cartoons as well as the publishing of the Swedish painter Lars Vilks ""Roundabout dog"", the second Intifada between Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing quarrel between Pakistani and Indian hacker groups, all with implication on security policy level. The paper ends with a short discussion on the risk for cyber escalation and the need to improve both information security and international cooperation in order to hinder or reduce the negative effects of antagonistic cyber operations.","Cyber conflicts; Cyber escalation; Defacement attacks; Hacker groups; Hacktivism; Indian-pakistan hacker conflict","Critical infrastructures; Information technology; International cooperation; Internet; Personal computing; Security of data; Security systems; Cyber conflicts; Cyber escalation; Defacement attacks; Hacker groups; Hacktivism; Indian-pakistan hacker conflict; Computer crime"

As such, many researchers have called for information security culture (ISC) to be embedded into organizations to positively influence employee behaviour towards protecting organizational information. Despite claims that ISC may influence employee behaviours to protect organizational information, there is little empirical work that examines the embedding of ISC into organizations. This paper argues that embedding ISC should not only focus on employee behaviour, but rather in a holistic manner, involve everyone in the organization. The argument is developed through case studies in two organizations based on semi structured interviews of respondents, observations, and documents analysis from each organization. The results show that the challenges of embedding ISC are not as simple as changing employee behaviour and technical aspects of security. Rather, the more challenging problem is how to embed ISC in a holistic manner that includes senior management support and involvement to instil awareness through mandatory training with a clear assignment of responsibility and constant enforcement of security policies and procedures. We believe that the findings will provide researchers in ISC with a broader view of how ISC can be embedded in organizations.","Enforcement; Information security; Information security culture; Information security policy; Organizational culture","Information systems; Research; Security systems; Societies and institutions; Embedding information; Enforcement; Holistic manner; Information security policy; Key factors; Organizational cultures; Organizational information; Security policy; Semi structured interviews; Senior management support; Technical aspects; Security of data"

Methods: The ISMS check-list derived from international/domestic standards was distributed to each hospital to complete and the staff of each hospital was interviewed. Information Security Indicator and Information Security Values were used to estimate the present security levels and evaluate the application of each hospital's current sys-tem. Results: With regard to the moderate clause of the ISMS, the hospitals were determined to be in compliance. The most vulnerable clause was asset management, in particular, information asset classification guidelines. The clauses of information security incident management and business continuity management were deemed necessary for the establishment of success-ful ISMS. Conclusions: The level of current ISMS in the hospitals evaluated was determined to be insufficient. Establishment of adequate ISMS is necessary to ensure patient privacy and the safe use of medical records for various purposes. Implemen-tation of ISMS which meet international standards with a long-term and comprehensive perspective is of prime importance.

We place a special emphasis on the methodical, tool-supported elicitation and definition of RBAC policies in this environment. In addition, we use the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) to transfer RBAC policies between the different nodes in information federations. Further, we present a corresponding security architecture in which those XACML policies are applied for authorization decision and enforcement.

As such, ETSI is a key player of the global Cybersecurity efforts, by addressing security issues in a broad number of areas including Next Generation Networks (NGN), protecting communications and the ICT infrastructure, working on mobile/wireless communications, emergency telecommunications, lawful interception and data retention.","","Cybernetics; Industrial research; Information science; Interoperability; Profitability; Regulatory compliance; Security of data; Standards; Telecommunication; Telecommunication networks; Continuous improvements; Cyber security; Data retention; Diverse range; European telecommunications standards institutes; Global community; ICT infrastructures; Industrial sector; Information and communications technology; Lawful interception; Mobile/wireless communication; Security issues; Information technology"

Although some reflection on the IR process may be involved, it is typically limited to technical issues and does not leverage opportunities to learn about the organisational security threat environment and to adapt incident response capabilities. Given the science of incident response is rooted in practice, it is not surprising that the same criticisms can be applied to much of IR literature. However, a review of literature in the area of organisational learning suggests that improvements can be made to the incident response process.

At the same time, Cyber Security emerges as one of the major concerns in the Power Sector, being reflected in the level of attention given to Information Security in forums such as CIGRÉ, IEEE, IEC, ISO, ISA and NIST. In spite of this, there is a high degree of obscurity on information security issues in the Power Industry. In this paper, a parallel is drawn between current arguments in favor of Cyber Security policies and procedures being kept secret, and the controversial strategy for protecting information called Security Through Obscurity (STO). In STO, endeavoring to maintaining the secrecy of the security mechanisms applied to protect the information is itself an important part of the security strategy. However, most cryptologists and experts in computational security refuse to apply such a strategy, arguing, instead, in favor of focusing on the improvement of systems design itself, not on its concealment. By considering technical and cultural aspects of the Power Industry, we argue that reducing the obscurity in Cyber Security is not only to be recommended, but is becoming mandatory. Additionally, we examine how Cyber Security is being tackled in Brazil, and the trends and major challenges faced by the largest power companies in Brazil.","Cyber security; Information security policy; IT governance in power companies","Electric utilities; Security systems; Computational security; Cultural aspects; Cyber security; Information security policies; Power company; Security mechanism; Security strategies; Technological convergence; Security of data"

This is necessary for both: designing the ""correct"" system and achieving interoperability with other systems. Security is maybe the best example of this need. If the understanding of the security requirements is not the same for all involved parties and the security mechanisms that will be implemented do not comply with some globally accepted rules and practices, then the system that will be designed will not necessarily achieve the desired security level and it will be very difficult to securely interoperate with other systems. It is therefore clear that the role and contribution of international standards to the design and implementation of security mechanisms is dominant. In this paper we provide a state of the art review on information security management standards published by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission. Such an analysis is meaningful to security practitioners for an efficient management of information security. Moreover, the classification of the standards in the clauses of ISO/IEC 27001:2005 that results from our analysis is expected to provide assistance in dealing with the plethora of security standards. © 2010 Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Information security management systems; Standardization","Industrial management; Information management; Information systems; International cooperation; Interoperability; Laws and legislation; Management information systems; Standardization; Systems analysis; Information security management systems; Information security managements; Information systems security; International Electrotechnical Commission; International organization for standardizations; International standards; ISO standards; ISO/IEC; Non-functional requirements; Security level; Security mechanism; Security practitioners; Security requirements; Security standards; State-of-the-art reviews; Security of data"

Further, the rapid technological advances have also created significant risks to organizations and government operations. The risks are expected to continue to escalate as new technologies and new Internet-enabled services emerge. As a result, the security strategies of these organizations need to evolve as well, in response to the evolving information security requirements. In short, there is a need for a proper information security management, within the context of the organization's structure, objectives and activities. One way to achieve this goal is to plan regular audits to evaluate the information systems security. The current available resources are typically guidelines and checklists, more or less linked to particular views. To address this issue, it was developed a framework based on a conceptual model approach. This solution introduces a new perspective to model information in security domain. It allows the description of the data semantics and enables to firm up and unify the concepts and terminology defined in the information security domain, based on the ISO/IEC-JTC1 standards. This paper presents the preliminary stage of the framework development, in particular, the adoption of the ontological approach for the information security management.","Audit; Conceptual model; Information security management; Information system security; Information systems security auditing; Ontology","Industrial management; Information systems; Internet; Ontology; Security of data; Semantics; Societies and institutions; Audit; Conceptual model; Information security managements; Information system security; Information systems security; Information management"

Any node is made up a myriad of software components, where each can potentially cripple the operations of the node. To address the security of the node, it is then crucial to determine the susceptibility of the underlying software components. Traditional protection systems like firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS), focus on high-level abstractions of the system. They fail to address the concerns of specific targeted attacks on the underlying software components. For this reason, we are developing a security system that profiles the individual software components, and monitors for threats specific to the vulnerabilities present in those components. This paper presents the research that has been conducted towards the creation of a unified analysis framework. We identify multiple open-source software analyzers, commercial approaches, and those based in literature. We then determine the methodology of the approaches and identify the characteristics adopt. Furthermore, we then identify the areas that are not addressed already, and incorporate them into the unified analysis framework.

The model is based on months of discussions with the Director of Security at the University of Maryland. It includes 1) the three stakeholders involved in security (attacker, user and organization) and the organization's assets, 2) characteristics for each stakeholder and the organization's assets (characteristics consist in attributes of each stakeholder and the organization's assets that have an influence on increasing or decreasing security), and 3) influences between the different characteristics. We will show how the qualitative model can be used to reason about security at several levels: assess organizational security, decide how to invest in security, and identify causes of security issues.","Decision-making; Human element; Information security; Qualitative model","Decision making; Information technology; Safety engineering; Causal model; Decision makers; Human element; Information technology security; Qualitative model; Security issues; Security strategies; University of Maryland; Security of data"

Operations management is a mediation between, first, the strategic planning and the guidance of work, and second, the different functions of an organization's reporting, in which every activity area can be systematically checked. The key idea is to have the organization managing in the whole information security operation be a positive management of change. To be a viable part of operations management, the information security management is resourced and supported in all enterprise levels by decisions at the top level. There are three types of operations management. The first, structural operations management, deals with restructuring and systemizing important areas such as management features. The second, resource information operations management, is based on the real-time registered information of selected organizations. And for the third, events reporting operations management, it is essential to actively report the organization's successes and, therefore, the knowledge of their utilization. Also, there are the three main types of management decision making and control processes, which are strategic planning, management control, and work control. Strategic planning contains the organization's overall strategies, goals, and change. Under management control, consistent results will be monitored to ensure the effectiveness of the organization's resources and the achievement of objectives. Work control directs attention to the daily performance of the functions. All of these actions can be linked to the plans and objectives of the higher performance of the organization. The main contribution of this study is based on the conceptual approach, which intends to construct systems of conceptions. The research has been done to combine previously presented dimensions of management and to develop a framework process for operations management which is useful for the actions of information security at different enterprise levels.","Information security governance and management; Security management for enterprises; Strategic leadership","Decision making; Empowerment of personnel; Industrial management; Industry; Process control; Security of data; Strategic planning; Control process; Information security governance; Information security managements; Management control; Management decision-making; Management of change; Operations management; Research papers; Resource information; Security management; Strategic leadership; Work control; Information management"

An attack is a group of activities including actions carried out by an adversary, the attacker, on a potential victim. The paper focuses on attacks that aim at overpowering the victim/prey to gain some benefit. This type of attack seems the most common in the field of computers. A brief review is given of various forms of modeling of information-security attacks with emphasis on use cases, and diagrams of misuse cases. Three kinds of attacks are examined from very diverse domains: (1) those in the animal world, where lion prides exhibit one of the most powerful tactics for overcoming prey, (2) those In the United States Air Force, where pilots use an Attack Cycle that includes detect, locate, identify, decide, execute, target, and assess, and (3) those in computer systems, where an attack has recently been described as comprising six phases: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Compromise/Exploit, Commandand- control, and Exfiltration. The paper examines existing models of the last two and introduces a new flow model to facilitate development of a general conceptual model of attacks. The flow model is defined in terms of a transition graph comprising five states. The flow model is a uniform method for representing things that ""flow,"" i.e., things that are received, processed, created, released, and/or transferred. Examples of ""things that flow"" (flowthings) include information, materials (e.g., in manufacturing), and money. A basic principle of the model is separation of various flowthings and identification of their flows. Accordingly, the conceptual picture of a pride's attack includes streams of flows of signals (from the environment), information, plans, decisions, and actions. These flows can trigger each other. The conceptual description includes the spheres of the attacker and those of the defender. Matters located in the defender's sphere are necessary for completely specifying the progression of the attack. We claim that such a methodology of attack modeling provides a more effective analysis in the fields of threat modeling and secure software development.","Attacks; Conceptual model; Information flow; Security; Threat risk","Network security; Attacks; Basic principles; Conceptual model; Diverse domains; Effective analysis; Exfiltration; Flow model; Information flows; Misuse case; Secure software development; Security; Threat modeling; Transition graphs; United States Air Force; Weaponization; Flow graphs"

Encryption algorithms play a main role in information security systems.

There is limited battery power available. Technologies such as CPU and memory are increasing and so is their need for power, but battery technology is increasing at a much slower rate, forming a ""battery gap"". Because of this, battery capacity plays a major role in the usability of the devices. The increasing demand for services on wireless devices has pushed technical research into finding ways to overcome these limitations. This paper provides evaluation of six of the most common encryption algorithms namely: AES (Rijndael), DES, 3DES, RC2, Blowfish, and RC6. We examine a method for analyzing tradeoffs between energy and security. We suggest approach to reduce the energy consumption of security protocols.

In conjunction with loopholes in the security structure of the organisation, these attacks can yield results that would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain through the use of purely technical hacking methods. As SE attacks are based on deception, they are very difficult to categorise. Hence, designing countermeasures for them is even more difficult and as such, to this day, provisions present in current security standards and best practices against SE methods are limited, indirect and rather inadequate. Thus, a more fundamental approach is called for, if effective defense methods are to be devised. The current analysis of the psychological aspects of SE forms part of a larger effort to identify the risks emerging from the largely non-technical issues of Information Security (IS) and devise methods for their mitigation.

The Completely Automatic Public Turing Test to tellComputers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) controls access to resources but automated systems are increasingly adept at overcoming them. In this paper a method of access control is introduced as an extra layer of security on top of existing CAPTCHA implementations. It uses visual encryption to encrypt images, which are presented to clients like a CAPTCHA. It's purpose is to compress many sub-images into a small image format that humans can decode visually but is hard for automated systems due to decrypting overhead, and having to process more images to nd the hidden image. This paper introducesvisual encryption as a viable method to encrypt CAPTCHAs, and tests a prototype to measure how efficiently users can nd them. It also measures whether this method could impede a real CAPTCHA breaker. Results show humans detect images within 16-33 seconds, and deciphering images is almost 100%. Estimates on CAPTCHA breaking benchmarks show automated systems would be slowed signicantly, even assuming the image is found and decoded. As sub-images increase, humans can process the visually encrypted images faster than automated systems can. © 2010, Australasian Information Security Conference.","Access control; Authentication; Automated attacks; CAPTCHA; Cryptography; Security; Spamming; Visual decryption; Visual processing","Access control; Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Automation; Computer crime; Cryptography; Electronic mail filters; Internet; Spamming; Automated attacks; CAPTCHAs; Security; Visual decryption; Visual-processing; Network security"

Currently the security agencies are mainly concerned with the management and interpretative techniques to help governments, security consultants and researchers to evaluate the massive amounts of data generated by the security information systems. The analyses of these massive and complex data are extremely difficult, but essential to achieve new discoveries. The main problem results from the fact that, it is very difficult to extract meaning and identify relations between data. An ontology approach to structure and organize the data collected, introduces a new dimension to the mechanisms currently used in the analysis and interpretation of data, since the ontology enables the description of the semantics content of the data. The ontology development, in the security domain, includes a concrete specification of term names and term meanings, which includes description of concepts and their relationships. This paper presents a conceptual model of an ontology defined in the security domain. The model presented contains the semantic concepts and the connections between then, defined in a subset of the information security domain. © 2010 IADIS.","Ontology; Security information systems; Semantics knowledge management","Information systems; Knowledge management; Ontology; Security of data; Semantics; Complex data; Conceptual model; Information systems security; Interpretation of data; New dimensions; Ontology development; Ontology-based; Security agencies; Security domains; Semantic concept; Structure data; Data mining"

Therefore, it requires the involvement of proper management ensuring that information assets are sufficiently secured and controlled. Truth is that the risk management discipline has received increasing attention in recent years due to increased regulations, ongoing changes and greater economic volatility that all affect the business environment. The purpose of a proper risk management action is to ensure transparency at all levels of the organization by taking the appropriate measures to reduce costs and manage financial, organizational and personal risk all at once, satisfying business objectives. However, due to misleading fallacies around its concept and the complexity that derive from governance, risk and compliance (GRC) activities, risk management falls short of assuring information assets. In this paper the results of our work on studying government, compliance and human factors in information security risk management are presented. The scope is to develop strategic perspectives around risk management implementation related to the concept of information security, helping minimize risks and cost. Sustaining security value over long term necessitates the realization of the information security lifecycle and the recognition of an imperative factor, the human involvement. Security spending remains a main concern despite the current economic crisis showing challenges that need to be confronted. Such challenges include maintaining a strong IT workforce, addressing growing foreign and domestic competition, developing critical infrastructure protection, balancing automated and manual controls and controlling intellectual property rights. The road ahead is the recognition of an enterprise risk management (ERM) strategy able to maintain security assurance and challenge ongoing changes that impact on the effectiveness of risk management. In addition, it is high time to consider a wider risk management approach, that of the societal risk management. For optimized results, the organization should foster a culture based on communication and feedback, recognizing training and security awareness a top priority. Creating a holistic picture of an enterprise as part of risk management and compliance efforts, it will provide a comprehensive platform for capturing and integrating multiple perspectives on processes, thus controlling information flow. Information assurance depends on the level of collaboration across internal and external parties and the correlation of disperse information. To avoid unpleasant circumstances, the risk management principle should engage into a dual approach of operability, that is maintaining performance and periodically re-evaluate itself to tackle with upcoming trends and risks.","Compliance; Human factor; Information security; Risk management; Strategy","Human engineering; Industry; Intellectual property; Laws and legislation; Security of data; All-at-once; Business environments; Business objectives; Compliance; Critical infrastructure protection; Domestic competition; Dual approach; Economic crisis; Enterprise risk management; Information assets; Information assurance; Information flows; Intellectual property rights; IT Workforce; Management principles; Ongoing changes; Personal risks; Security assurance; Security awareness; Security value; Strategic perspectives; Strategy; Risk management"

The ""solidarity clause"" of the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on December 1st 2009, dictates that all EU member states shall act jointly if another member state is the target of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or man-made disaster. Sweden has gone even further, stating that it will not remain passive if a member state or another Nordic country is attacked, and expects these countries to act in the same manner if Sweden is attacked. This declaration obligates Sweden to be able to collaborate successfully with allied partners, both within own territories and abroad. Application-based collaboration tools for use in unpredictable settings, requiring high user mobility and network survivability, put high demands on the underlying ICT systems in order to function correctly. Networks employing the TErrestrial Trunked RAdio (TETRA) standard are becoming pervasive as platforms for interagency collaboration in crisis response. Although these networks provide many benefits compared to legacy technology they lack the possibility to offer secure, infrastructure-less and disruption-tolerant communication in challenging environments. Emerging ICT such as MANET-based Reconfigurable Radio Systems (RRS) shows potential for overcoming these problems, in addition to resolving issues of technical heterogeneity. The Common Tactical Radio System (GTRS) is an RRS being developed by the Swedish Armed Forces, intended to be the future ICT system for all parts of the forces, used both in national and international mission settings. However, remaining challenges include threats of node compromisation and adversary network infiltration, as well as the safeguarding of confidential information shared by collaborating parties and preventing information leakage. This paper contributes by (i) giving a summary of recent work in mechanisms for achieving information security in tactical MANETs and Hastily Formed Networks for disaster response. The paper also (ii) presents in-progress work towards the design of a gossip-based cross-layer Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) for the GTRS system, which takes resource constraints of portable devices into account, and offloads traffic analysis and anomaly detection to more powerful ""Big Brother"" nodes.

As a corporation's management will not accept complex or extensive mathematical approaches, the only way is to improve questioning within the risk analysis framework. The paper follows the idea of Guttman scaling as presented at ESREL 2009: a FMEA structures the risk analysis approach whereas the Code of Practice (ISO/IEC 27002) gives a limited set of recommendations with regard to Information Security (IS) management. Finally, the Guttman scaling of questions about the fulfilment of recommendations results in a ranked list of staggered IS management measurements, i.e., the total fulfilment of an IS objective will result in an expected low frequency of IS management failures. The paper pictures the improvements and developments of Guttman Scaling of IT security objectives. Progress has been made in re-wording and completing the list of Guttman questions with regard to ISO/IEC 27002. Special consideration was taken to enquire only a single attribute per question. The statistical analysis of the final matrix of measurements with regard to the Code's Objectives uses hierarchical clustering methods and results are shown as dendrograms. The set of Guttman questions is further simplified in order to meet business context.

These SCADA systems resemble the central nervous system of the power system. At the same time as control systems enables more efficient, qualitative, and safe power systems, their vulnerabilities are also vulnerabilities to the power system. This paper presents a modeling language specifically developed for assessing the cyber security of SCADA systems. The modeling language uses the formalism Probabilistic Relational Models to integrate a mathematical inference engine with the modeling notation. If a SCADA system is modeled using this cyber security modeling language the cyber security of this SCADA system can be assessed probabilistically. Given a graphical description of a system, a quantitative analysis of threats is provided. This makes it possible to use the framework for evaluating the current solution as well as elaborate with what-if scenarios and the trade-offs between these. This cyber security modeling language could for example be used to model two control centers and the communication between them together with security mechanisms such as access control and communication protection The modeling language can also be used to describe a complete SCADA system and infer its security. The data associated with the probabilistic inference engine is only preliminary. In this paper we present a case study where cyber security modeling language has been applied to assess the security of a SCADA system. It is demonstrated how the modeling language can be applied and how a value for security can be inferred from architectural models (using the preliminary data). Future work will focus on the quantitative side of the modeling language. Probabilities will be elicited from literature, experiments, and field studies and through the opinion of domain experts. A tool is also being developed to support inference and analysis.","Cyber security; Information security; Information technology; Probabilistic relational models; SCADA","Access control; Communication; Computer control systems; Information technology; Security of data; Architectural models; Central nervous systems; Cyber security; Cyber security of SCADA systems; Graphical description; Probabilistic inference; Probabilistic relational models; SCADA; SCADA systems"

The TB is published during 2010. The work has been carried out between 2006 and 2009. The WG D2.22 is the successor of Joint Working Group (JWG) D2/B3/C2-01 on ""Security for Information Systems and Intranets in Electric Power System"" (2003 - 2006/2007). The WG D2.22 has focussed and deepened the study on the following three issues: • Frameworks for EPUs on how to manage information security, • Risk assessment (RA) and Risk Management (RM): Common models and methods for treating vulnerabilities, threats and attacks, and • Security technologies for SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems/control systems including real time control networks. As intermediate results, the WG D2.22 has produced six papers, published in Electra and at Cigré Session and Colloquium. It is concluded that an overall security framework should be based on existing standards and ""best practices"", taking into account legal and regulatory requirements. A framework should be based on risk assessment. The technical solution should be based on a domain model and technical security controls consistently assigned with the domain definition. The selection of the ""proper"" standard(s) is delicate, and an up-to-date and critical vision of the fast-moving landscape is necessary. It is evident that information security for an EPU will continue to be an important issue, in both the short and long run. As natural further works, the following are proposed: 1) To improve methods for use of security frameworks and deploying risk assessment and management methods; 2) To provide guidance on how to more deeply involve and get acceptance from top level management regarding the importance of information and IT security; 3) To provide guidance on how to embed information security as a natural and mandatory part through all phases of a project, from specification through acceptance, and throughout the operational life of a system.","Control systems; Cyber security; Electric power utility; Industrial control systems; Information security; ISO/IEC standard; IT security; Power system control; Power systems; Risk assessment; SCADA; Security framework; Security technology","Control systems; Electric power systems; Information technology; Network security; Real time control; Risk assessment; Risk management; SCADA systems; Security of data; Security systems; Standby power systems; Cyber security; Electric power utilities; Industrial control systems; ISO/IEC standard; IT security; Power system controls; SCADA; Security frameworks; Security technology; Information management"

By delegating parts of enforcement tasks to trusted elements dispersed in a system, the system can establish transitive trust relationships. This is the most advanced evolution of the organisational method of separation of duties within IT security.

And since trust is a matter of relationships, financial organisations need to create, expand and maintain consumer trust for communication, transactions and payments. Financial institutions are known for their ability to cultivate long-standing relationships with their clients based on integrity and trust. And as we move towards electronic-based transactions, there is the need to explore the factor of trust in order to identify how financial organizations are shaped in the future and what issues are raised. Trust always affects two measurable outcomes: speed and cost and there are essentially two mechanisms that lead to economic notions of trust, the one is based on repeated interaction the other one is based on beliefs. The ultimate goal is to engage online commerce users quickly and establish and preserve strategic trust under challenging situations. In the ecommerce context, based on the target, the study of trust can be categorized as macro-level or micro-level. The macro-level study of trust deals with what called institution-based trust and the micro-level study of trust is different from the macro-level study in that the target of the former is an individual e-business. The research questions that are brought in the surface are: what exactly is trust in the on-line environment? What are the sources of trust? Is there more than one form of trust? Is it a static or dynamic phenomenon etc. The paper will try to explore, examine, and describe the methods for estimating the economic value of trust (cost of developing trust, maintaining trust and trust failure), the impacts of trust on e -economy (general finding) and how trustworthy financial organizations are created and finally financial organizations benefit from trust.","E-commerce; Information security economics; Trust","Economics; Electronic commerce; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Dynamic phenomena; E-commerce context; eBusiness; Economic values; Financial institution; Financial organizations; Information security economics; One-form; Online commerce; Online environments; Research questions; Trust; Finance"

The classication of concepts and characteristics in the framework arises from a review of recent literature and is underpinned by theoretical models that explain these concepts and characteristics. Further, based upon an exploratory study of three case organisations in Saudi Arabia involving extensive interviews with senior managers, department managers, IT managers, information security officers, and IT staff; this article describes observed information security practices and identies several factors which appear to be particularly important in in uencing information security behaviour.

Research has shown that alignment between corporate functions may be enhanced when strategies are developed concurrently using the same development process as an integrative relationship is established. Utilizing the corporate risk management framework for security policy management establishes such an integrative relationship between information security and corporate risk management objectives and strategies. There is however limitation in the current literature on presenting a definitive approach that fully integrates security policy management with the corporate risk management framework. This paper presents an approach that adopts a conventional corporate risk management framework for security policy development and management to achieve alignment with the corporate risk policy objectives. A case example is examined to illustrate the alignment achieved in each process step with a security policy structure being derived in the process. It is shown that information security policy management outcomes become both integral drivers and major elements of the corporate-level risk management considerations.

In this study, we attempt to develop a theoretical model that integrates three main stream criminology theories, i.e., general deterrence, rational choice, and individual propensity. We submit that, while the main decision process leading to an offensive act may be explained by the rational choice theory, selfcontrol and deterrence factors could significantly alter the risk-benefit calculus assumed in the rational choice model. Using data collected from employees in multiple organizations, we tested our model using structural equation modelling techniques. We found that the perceived benefits of offensive acts dominate the rational calculus in individuals, and that the low self-control significantly impacts the perceived benefits and risks, thus playing a major role in the computer offences perpetrated by individuals in organizational settings. In addition, we found that deterrence only has limited impact on the offensive intentions through increased perceived risks. By integrating multiple theories into one seamless model, we hope to provide better understanding of computer offences and deeper insights for improving information security management practices.","Computer crimes; Computer offences; Criminology; Individual behavior; Information security","Calculations; Computer crime; Crime; Decision theory; Industrial management; Information management; Information systems; Mathematical models; Network security; Risk perception; Security of data; Social sciences; Choice model; Criminology; Criminology theories; Decision process; Global economies; Individual behavior; Information security managements; Multiple organizations; Organizational setting; Perceived benefits; Perceived risk; Rational choice theory; Structural equation modelling; Theoretical models; Computer control systems"

Methods: To assure that patient's medical information can be effectively exchanged under different system environments, we adopted the standardized data transfer methods and terminologies suggested by the Center for Interoperable Electronic Healthcare Record (CIEHR) of Korea in order to guarantee interoperability. Regarding information security, MIES followed the security guidelines suggested by the CIEHR of Korea. This study aimed to develop essential security systems for the implementation of online services, such as encryption of communication, server security, database security, protection against hacking, contents, and network security. Results: The registry server managed information exchange as well as the registration information of the clinical document architecture (CDA) documents, and the CDA Transfer Server was used to locate and transmit the proper CDA document from the relevant repository. The CDA viewer showed the CDA documents via connection with the information systems of related hospitals. Conclusions: This research chooses transfer items and defines document standards that follow CDA standards, such that exchange of CDA documents between different systems became possible through ebXML.

Knowledge is acknowledged as an important asset along with traditional resources such as money and raw materials. The discipline of knowledge management seeks answers to questions such as how to make the best use of knowledge within an organization. As well as every asset, also knowledge needs to be protected so that it is properly secured from outsiders and other threats. Knowledge security addresses the protection of knowledge in organizations. However in the real world, the knowledge management efforts and the knowledge security efforts have little to do with each other, even though both aim to nurture the same assets. The people that plan and implement knowledge management strategies are not necessarily the same people who plan for security. Thus literature on the topic of these concepts is written for different audiences with different interests. This paper explores the literature for knowledge management and knowledge security management. Both management books and scientific articles are reviewed. Common goals and common incentives are searched for, as well as grounding differences in approaches. The approach of this paper is theoretical. The paper comprises conceptual examination of two concepts; knowledge management and knowledge security. Especially knowledge security is a relatively new concept, so study of relating concepts from the field of information security is needed. The paper also takes a deeper look into the concept of knowledge and its role in both of the concepts under study. The aim of the paper is to find out the common factors and main differences of knowledge management and knowledge security. Common factors of the concepts include for example a close connection to strategic planning and the aim to codify important knowledge. Implications for the practitioners are presented and discussed.","Knowledge management; Knowledge security","Knowledge management; Security of data; Common factors; Knowledge management strategy; Knowledge security; Scientific articles; Security management; Management science"

Governance and management of security are most effective when they are systemic, woven into the culture and fabric of organizational behaviors and actions. In this regard, culture is defined as the predominating shared attitudes, values, goals, behaviors, and practices that characterize the functioning of a group or organization. Culture thereby creates and sustains connections among principles, policies, processes, products, people, and performance. Effective security should be thought of as an attribute or characteristic of an organization or a project. It becomes evident when everyone proactively carries out their roles and responsibilities, creating a culture of security that displaces ignorance and apathy. One manifestation of this is that everyone proactively considers the attacker perspective throughout the software development life cycle and how the software can fail when under intentional attack or unintentional actions of users or developers. An important aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information. Not all information is equal and so not all information requires the same degree of protection. This requires information to be assigned a security classification. Security must come off the technical sidelines as activities and responsibilities solely relegated to software development and IT departments. Today, boards of directors, senior executives, and managers all must work to establish and reinforce a relentless drive toward effective enterprise, information, system, and software security. Because security is now a business problem, the organization must activate, coordinate, deploy, and direct many of its core resources and competencies to manage security risks in concert with the entity's strategic goals, operational criteria, compliance requirements, and technical system architecture.","Effective security; Information; Organization; Security classification","Information technology; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Software design; Boards of directors; Business problems; Degree of protection; Effective security; Information; Intentional Attacks; Organizational behavior; Protection requirements; Public administration; Roles and responsibilities; Romania; Security classification; Security risks; Security strategies; Software development life cycle; Software security; Strategic goals; Technical systems; Value of information; Security of data"

With the dramatic increase today in the number of accounts that require passwords, overwhelmed users usually resort to creating weak passwords or reusing the same password for multiple accounts, thus making passwords the weakest link in the chain of security. It has been recognized that instead of solely relying on their memory for passwords, users can take advantage of technology. One such technology is a password management application, which enables a user to create and store multiple passwords in a strongly protected file and then retrieve them as ne-cessary, thus alleviating the need to memorize numerous passwords. However, few users have chosen to take advantage these applications. Is it because users have rejected them as poor solu-tions, or because they were unaware of these applications and their potential benefits? Would us-ers be more favorable towards password management applications after they received training about these applications and then used them? And what limitations of these applications could be addressed to foster more widespread use? To date no studies have provided training to users re-garding these applications prior to surveying their reactions to determine if indeed these applica-tions are suitable for the average user.

To mitigate this issue, cyber security may be integrated into the design and development process of digital safety systems. Cyber security features that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability may be integrated into the design of these systems. In addition, a robust information security program should be implemented to secure the development environment of these digital systems to prevent malicious manipulation of the system while under development. However, concerns have been raised regarding the effect that such cyber security features may have on the performance and operation of safety systems. The intent of this paper is to address these concerns by demonstrating how cyber security features can be integrated into the design of safety systems. Specifically, this paper demonstrates how several safety features can also be utilized to enforce cyber security, and how several additional cyber security features may be integrated into the safety system design without degrading safety functions. Furthermore, this paper discusses how configuration management and access control during the development process can mitigate cyber security concerns by preventing unauthorized manipulation of the system while under development.

This paper gives an overview of some technical solutions and description of information system architecture in this complex project. It also describes mitigation techniques and strategies regarding cyber security including information on what mechanisms are available and how they should be activated and used. The establishment of the security framework itself and the execution of the security controls require organization of security activities in a structured manner - the implementation of security control has started with Information Security Management System documentation. Central security and network management system will be implemented in all control centers with following major components: central account management system based on Active Directory, PKI, central antivirus orchestrator, centralized patch management system, network monitoring, security monitoring and syslog-event log system.

Thus, this paper develops a conceptual framework for identifying, bringing together, and interpreting the deep-rooted social and technical issues that pertain to information systems security. The framework is grounded in semiotics and is validated by the analysis of a specific case study. Findings in this research indicate that the social and technical elements of security can be brought together in a holistic manner via six layers of abstraction where each layer addresses deep-rooted issues that pertain to information security. The output of each layer is then used to inform other layers in a collaborative manner creating a final product that contains elements for enriching security analysis and enhancing security policy formation.","Information security; Security analysis; Security policy; Semiotics","Concentration (process); Information systems; Research; Security of data; Semiotics; Conceptual frameworks; Holistic approach; Holistic manner; Information systems security; Security analysis; Security policy; Security systems"

Building on existing ethical frameworks, we developed a set of ethical scenarios concerning data access, data manipulation, software use, programming abuse, and hardware use. We surveyed 537 students from three countries about their own ethical experiences and our ethics scenarios.

This is especially the case among university students who are generally regarded as major violators of computer ethics and computer security. This paper follows previous work on computer security and ethics. The paper intend to examine the level of ethical and security awareness among IT and education students. The findings of this study reveals that there are satisfactory levels of awareness among the students surveyed with slightly higher level of awareness among IT students, most likely due to security and ethics courses they offered. Also, the findings indicate that gender-wise male students reported higher level of computer security and ethics violations than their female counterparts. The paper concludes that female students are more conscious of security and ethics while using computer (e.g. Internet) than the male students. Furthermore, IT students were found to be more aware of internet security & ethics, but largely ignore this knowledge and are more engaged in unethical activities and illegal internet practices when compared with Education students. © 2010 IEEE.","computer ethics; Computer security; education; IIUM; information technology","Behavioral research; Computer crime; Information technology; Internet; Philosophical aspects; Security systems; Students; Telecommunication networks; Computer ethics; Empirical studies; Female students; IIUM; Internet security; Security awareness; University students; Security of data"

In conjunction with outside sources used to parallel some key points between other organizations, such as universities and non-profit agencies, the Security Systems Development Life Cycle is a methodology used as the basis for this paper. The information from outside sources suggests that universities and non-profit businesses have suffered from massive attacks to the vital information of their students and personnel. To avoid falling victim to a predator waiting to induce the same systemic damage that has plagued these organizations, local law enforcement agencies must begin to develop plans to protect themselves in ways not traditionally thought of. Just as these two organizations house personal and organizational information that could be damaging if compromised, so to do local law enforcement agencies. A local law enforcement agency concerns vast information on, not only personnel but, defendants, victims, and witnesses as well. These defendants, victims, and witnesses have a right to have their information protected. A compromise to information could be severely damaging to the reputation and morale of any local law enforcement agency. With the thought of a possible deviant lurking and waiting for the opportune moment to strike, the local law enforcement agency should be approaching a sound, viable, and holistic program for their defensive strategy-the Security Systems Development Life Cycle offers the framework for a much needed information security program.

This study, therefore, expands the model of a defender's decision-making process that started with the accounting model, analyzes strategic behavior of an attacker and models the interactive decision-making process of two players. The most significant point of this study is to model the interaction of the two players making optimal decisions in relation to each other's decisions. In addition, we compared the equilibrium of a simultaneous game with a sequential game in which one player moves first and the other moves later. The late mover observes the behavior of the first mover and then decides its own behavior.

The new trends of telecommunications of the last year is the move towards the trasmission of voice over traditional packet switched IP network, voice over IP, that has become a valid alternative to traditional public circuit-switched telephone network and then the convergence of the communication systems, through the next generation networks definition. This environment presents many security problems and significant security challenges. The voice over IP system increase these with those normally tie to IP network. Along with a several benefits of voice over IP, there are new security threats for exchanged informations. This paper analyzes the security issues of the communication systems, starting from the traditional public switched telephone network toward the new next generation network. Then, with this paper, we want to introduce a process approach to manage the security, based on epidemiological model. This model is characterized by three steps, Analysis, Assessment and Management, and it can be applied to a general information security system, to identify, assess and classify the information assets, the processes concerning it, vulnerabilities of each level and common threats. Finally we evaluate the risk and the probability of damage that can crash the system or part of this and propose a model of failure time analysis. The target of this analysis is to calculate the extent of the risk function in order to understand the state and the degree of security of our system, by studying the statistics of failure and to ensure highest degree of security optimizing the business strategic decisions and information and communication technology security economic investments. The methodology is designed to be applied in the future to communication systems, more specifically.

However, Information Assurance on P2P is currently performed on a case-by-case basis. The solutions proposed, although necessary, have been isolated, focusing on the specific problems at hand for a particular P2P architecture. This paper discusses the benefits that a security-centric simulation platform would provide. While other P2P simulators have long been available, none of them has a focus on security. To this end, we propose a components-based framework to enable experimentation with different security parameters. By using components with well-defined interfaces, we aim to minimize the effort required to use a different strategy for a function, be it routing a message, or finding a peer. The ultimate goal is to be able to compare the systems side-by-side. Our objective is for this framework to provide useful comparison metrics, thus establishing a common test bed for the different security models that exist today for P2P.","Peer-to-peer; Security; System design; Testbed","Equipment testing; Knowledge engineering; Software engineering; Systems analysis; Test facilities; Testbeds; Comparison metrics; Information assurance; P2P architecture; Peer to peer; Peer-to-peer securities; Peer-to-Peer system; Research platforms; Security; Security model; Security parameters; Simulation platform; Specific problems; System design; Peer to peer networks"

This paper introduces the notion of a governance framework for information security for health providers. It refines the idea of an IT Balanced Scorecard into a scorecard process for use in governing information security for primary care health providers, where IT and security skills may be limited. The approach amends and justifies the four main elements of the scorecard process. The existence of a governance framework specifically tailored for the needs of primary care practice is a critical success factor if such organisations are to move to a robust level of information security. The challenge is twofold. Firstly, measures for governance need to be understandable to the target audience using the framework. Secondly, the number of measures needs to be controllable otherwise the process will become unviable and unused. This research synthesizes existing models and industry standards to formulate a new governance process that meets these two important criteria. The contribution of this research is in the refinement of governance metrics to make them useful to healthcare providers, specifically in relation to IT and new information communication technologies.","Framework; General practice; Governance; Health; Information security","Health; Health care; Industrial management; Information technology; Balanced scorecards; Critical success factor; Framework; General practice; Governance; Health care providers; Industry standards; Information communication technology; Information security governance; Primary care; Target audience; Security of data"

It sketches the diverse technical ways in which an attack may occur, including denial-of-service attacks and the insertion of various forms of malware. It argues that existing international law and widely discussed principles of Just War Theory do not straightforwardly apply to cyberwarfare, and many forms of cyberwarfare differ from previous forms of warfare in neither injuring nor killing human beings, nor causing lasting physical damage - but can nevertheless cause serious harm to a nation's vital interests. Another dissimilarity with traditional warfare is in the degree of knowledge of the identity of an attacker (the 'attribution problem'). The paper argues that cyberwarfare is not amenable to regulation by international pacts and that we can expect long periods of low-level, multilateral cyberwarfare, a Cyber Cold War, as a game-theoretic equilibrium is sought,. The paper laments the lack of a cyberwarfare policy, and concludes that it is only by applying game-theoretic principles that strategies can be discovered that are both moral and effective in suppressing overall harm to all parties in the long run. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Cyberattack; Cyberespionage; Cybersecurity; Cyberwarfare; Ethics; Just war theory",""

Mobile agents can switch themselves among the hosts connected in a heterogeneous networking. Mobile agents can independently finish the assigned tasks and also can communicate with the other agents with the property of less transmission delay. The goal of efficiency and availability in a distributed system can be achieved by the mobile-agent technology. Nowadays mobile agents have been widely used in e-commerce, wireless communication, information security and so forth. However, when a mobile agent performs its task, it can exchange messages with the other agents over the Internet. In such way, mobile agents will encounter some security threats such as data stolen or data falsified. Thus Volker and Mehrdad proposed a tree-structured access control scheme in 1998 to secure the mobile agents by adding the key management technology so as to achieve the goal of security and confidentiality. Two drawbacks, larger amount of duplicated keys and key-derivation computations, make their scheme inefficient. Thus, a hierarchical structure of mobile agents is proposed in this paper. In this structure, users are restricted to access data only in a range of legal time. Also the technique of bilinear pairings over elliptic curves is used to construct a time-bound key management for controlling the access of private keys. From the security analyses, the security and efficiency of mobile agents can be achieved in the proposed scheme.","Access control; Bilinear pairings; Key management; Mobile agent; Time bound","Access control; Autonomous agents; Engineers; Internet; Security systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Access control schemes; Agent technology; Bilinear pairing; Bilinear pairings; Distributed systems; E-Commerce; Elliptic curve; Heterogeneous networking; Hierarchical key assignment; Hierarchical structures; Information security; Key management; Private key; Security analysis; Security threats; Time bound; Transmission delays; Wireless communications; Mobile agents"

Current ISRA methods identify an organisation's security risks and provide a measured, analysed security risk profile of critical information assets in order to build plans to treat risk. However, despite prevalent use in organisations today, current methods adopt a limited view of information assets during risk identification. In the context of day-to-day activities, people copy, print and discuss information, leading to the 'leakage' of information assets. Employees will create and use unofficial assets as part of their day-to-day routines. Furthermore, employees will also possess important knowledge on how to perform their functions within a business process or information system. These are all elements of business 'practice', a perspective that would yield a richer and holistic understanding of an organisation's information assets and vulnerabilities. This perspective is not captured by traditional ISRA methods, leading to an incomplete view of an organisation's information systems and processes that could prove detrimental and damaging. This paper hence suggests that a business practice perspective be incorporated into ISRA methods in order to identify information leakage, unofficial, critical information assets and critical process knowledge of organisations.","Asset identification; Business practice; Information leakage; Information security risk management; Knowledge security","Industrial management; Information systems; Management science; Risk assessment; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Asset identification; Business practices; Business Process; Critical information; Information assets; Information leakage; Information security risk assessment; Knowledge security; Process knowledge; Risk Identification; Security risks; Security of data"

Visual Cryptography is the study of mathematical techniques related aspects of Information Security which allows Visual information to be encrypted in such a way that their decryption can be performed by the human visual system, without any complex cryptographic algorithms. This technique represents the secret image by several different shares of binary images. It is hard to perceive any clues about a secret image from individual shares. The secret message is revealed when parts or all of these shares are aligned and stacked together. In this paper we provide an overview of the emerging Visual Cryptography (VC) techniques used in the secure transfer of the thousands of images collected by the satellite which are stored in image library and sent to Google for use on Google Earth and Google maps. The related work is based on the recovering of secret image using a binary logo which is used to represent the ownership of the host image which generate shadows by visual cryptography algorithms. An error correction-coding scheme is also used to create the appropriate shadow. The logo extracted from the half-toned host image identifies the cheating types. Furthermore, the logo recovers the reconstructed image when shadow is being cheated using an image self-verification scheme based on the Rehash technique which rehash the halftone logo for effective self verification of the reconstructed secret image without the need for the trusted third party(TTP). © 2010 IEEE.","Contrast; Halftoning; Pixels; Rehashing technique; Shares; Stacking; Verifying shares; Visual secret sharing","Algorithms; Climate change; Cryptography; Pixels; Security of data; Space optics; Contrast; Halftoning; Rehashing technique; Shares; Stacking; Verifying shares; Visual secret sharing; Image processing"

We have added the set of security drivers and scenarios, in order to model the effect of misuse cases (triggered by security breaches). After simulation of security breaches and misuse cases, their influence on the rest of the environmental drivers (and the TBM models and scenarios) is calculated.

SMC is a problem of information security when large organizations interact with one another for huge data sharing and data exchange. It is quite possible that during sharing and exchange, the private data also get hacked. In order to protect and secure the private data, the protocols of SMC need to be deployed in the large computer networks on which the organizations work. The protocols work at the micro-level in terms of cryptography with which the data are encrypted and then shared, while allowing the keys to be used for sharable data while also keeping the keys untouched for private data. At the macro level, multilevel architectures are used for different types of security to be achieved. The computation part of the secured multiparty computation is based on the algorithmic complexity theory. The algorithms realize the protocols in such a way that it is tedious to break (decrypt) the keys to hack the private data. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Correctness; Cyberspace; Privacy; Secure multiparty computation (SMC); Security; Trusted third party (TTP)","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Computers; Cryptography; Network protocols; Parallel processing systems; Correctness; Cyberspaces; Secure multi-party computation; Security; Trusted third parties; Network security"

The only way of controlling the threats is executing a process of risk management which enables managing the threats. This article represents the ways of managing the threats, and researches the existence of risk management systems in practice. For this purpose, a research has been conducted among different organizations. The results of the research are revealing the problems of incomprehension of the threats. Moreover, a structure of risk management systems depends completely on each individual organization. The problem is therefore a fact that exist as many systems as organizations. The organizations choose mostly among following approaches: informal or unsystematic approach; general approach which provides the same protection mechanism for every organizational level; exact approach which refers to analysis of the entire information system; the combination of general and exact approach. When the organizations choose the approach, they establish the control mechanisms. With those mechanisms we can simply avoid the risks, mitigate the consequences, accept a particular risk, or introduce adequate security mechanisms. Due to continual changes, such system must be constantly evaluated and improved. In the process of managing the information security, it is of great significance to establish the risk management system, to be able to recognize the most exposed fields and to protect them accordingly.","Certification; Information system; ISO 27000; Management; Risks; Security threats","Information management; Information systems; Management information systems; Research; Risk management; Sandwich structures; Societies and institutions; Certification; Control mechanism; Exact approach; General approach; ISO 27000; Organizational levels; Protection mechanisms; Risk management systems; Security mechanism; Security threats; Security of data"

The threat of cyber attacks poses risks to this mission. Current network security research focuses on the threat of cyber attacks to the organization's IT infrastructure; however, the risks to the overall mission are rarely analyzed or formalized. This connection of IT infrastructure to the organization's mission is often neglected or carried out ad-hoc. Our work bridges this gap and introduces analyses and formalisms to help organizations understand the mission risks they face from cyber attacks. Modeling an organization's mission vulnerability to cyber attacks requires a description of the IT infrastructure (network model), the organization mission (business model), and how the mission relies on IT resources (correlation model). With this information, proper analysis can show which cyber resources are of tactical importance in a cyber attack, i.e., controlling them enables a large range of cyber attacks. Such analysis also reveals which IT resources contribute most to the organization's mission, i.e., lack of control over them gravely affects the mission. These results can then be used to formulate IT security strategies and explore their trade-offs, which leads to better incident response.

This paper proposes to integrate generalization and suppression to reduce information loss. However, the integration is non-trivial. We propose novel techniques to address the efficiency and scalability challenges. Extensive experiments on real world databases show that this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including global generalization, local generalization, and total suppression. In addition, transaction data anonymized by this approach can be analyzed by standard data mining tools, a property that local generalization fails to provide. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anonymity; Information security; Privacy; Transaction data","Data mining; Anonymity; Data-mining tools; Information loss; Information security; Key feature; Local generalization; Non-trivial; Novel techniques; Performance drawback; Privacy; Privacy protection; Real-world database; State-of-the-art methods; Transaction data; Data privacy"

One way to do this is to add a capstone course at the end of the program. A well designed capstone course can allow your students to demonstrate their mastery of the program knowledge and skills. Walsh College offers a Master of Science in Information Assurance (MSIA) degree program that includes a capstone course. The capstone course is modeled after the Master of Science in Business Information Technology (MSBIT) capstone course originally developed by Dr. W.Don Gottwald. The capstone course was designed to meet the school's goals and objectives, be integrative, span the program curriculum, and be rigorous for the students. To complete the capstone course, every student needs to demonstrate a mastery of the skills taught across the twelve courses in the IA program which is exclusively offered online. This project attempts to identify the design issues that a school should address before launching a capstone course. A well designed capstone course will help the school, faculty, and students succeed with the program.

With mounting global network connectivity, the issue of intrusion has achieved importance, promoting active research on efficient Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a new bio-inspired model which is applied for solving various problems in the field of information security. The unique features AIS encourage the researchers to employ this techniques in variety of applications and especially in intrusion detection systems. Proper IDS design is essential to improve the performance of the IDS. The centralized design of this IDS has disadvantage of central processing for massive processes for each packets passing trough network. In this paper we proposed a distributed multi-layerd framework to enhance the detection performance and efficiency of this IDS. In our design the genetic algorithm is used for enhancing the secondary immune response. The fundamental design of our proposed AIS based IDS consists of 2 main components: IDS central engine and detection sensors. Each of these components is composed of some agents which correlate with each other in order to detect the anomalies and intrusions.

The cloud service providers foresee it as a source of promising financial gains, the clients find it a convenient solution where the enterprises may get started on their computing activities without investing on the in-house facilities of hardware and software. They can outsource the computing and archiving activities to the cloud service providers (CSP) though Internet. There are many dimensions of these activities and the researchers are trying to find acceptable solutions for the industry. In this paper, we have focused on the information security issues when migrating to a cloud environment. The confidence of end user can be won partially by the guarantees of service provider and use of cryptographic techniques. It is important that the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) should be included in the models which support forensic study whenever required. It is equally important to address the issue of antiforensic methods that the service providers may use to hide their malicious activities. Therefore the clients would like to have a better, in-depth knowledge of information management at service providers' end. For this purpose tools to probe into the cloud services are required. To elaborate on this issue we have chosen the data archiving and storage model used for medical service providers and hospitals. It is a classic test-case where Patients' history has to be maintained under the guidelines of HIPPA. The Amazon security model has been reviewed for this purpose both for archiving and disaster recovery.

It can roam freely in different Internet environments, adapt itself to various types of online servers totally associated to the characteristics of said server, and detect its environment and automatic adaptation to the environment while executing the assigned tasks by users. Due to these competencies, mobile agents have been widely used in Internet business, wireless communications, information security technologies and so forth. In 1983, Akl and Taylor suggested the concept of super-key to resolve the key management issues. It's the kind of thing where a mobile agent faces. Thus in 1998, Volker and Mehrdad proposed a tree-based mobile agent model to deal with the access control problem. The proposed scheme is based upon Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC), which enhances the operational ability of a mobile agent because of shorter key length and higher efficiency on encryption and decryption processes. For a mobile agent, a said user will be forced to log out of the system due to error or change in the user's rights or after a period of time. As is the case, the system must keep modifying the original access rights of the key so as to prevent a user from continuing to use his old key. However, this action could cause unnecessary error and risks, in addition to the large amount of computations that the system needs to perform. Hence, this paper proposes a Date-constraint key management scheme, where a date is attached to a key, so as to give its validity period of the key. Thus, key management can be more efficient.","Access control; Date-constraint key management; Elliptic curve cryptosystem; Key management; Mobile agent","Access control; Cryptography; Engineers; Geometry; Internet; Management; Security systems; Servers; Wireless telecommunication systems; Access rights; Automatic adaptation; Control problems; Date-constraint key management; Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem; Encryption and decryption; Higher efficiency; Information security technologies; Internet environment; Key management; Online servers; Operational ability; Tree-based; Wireless communications; Mobile agents"

In general, approaches to Air Force risk management and cybersecurity have focused largely on the implementation of technology as reactive mechanisms in the operational environment. The importance of proactively addressing the risks associated with space/cyberspace integration at any point in the system development lifecycle (SDLC) and iteratively re-addressing those risks throughout the SDLC has become even greater in the face of continually evolving cyberspace threats. In response to this situation, an approach to threat and vulnerability assessments has been developed to conduct risk identification, analysis, handling, and monitoring iteratively throughout the SDLC for the Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Systems Wing (MCSW) portfolio of programs. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Terminal Engineering Office (JTEO) emphasizes proactive end to end terminal engineering analysis that is critical to the success of terminal acquisition programs (systems development) and the operational (warfighter) mission. This paper presents the JTEO's approach to addressing cyber-based threats and vulnerabilities to MILSATCOM systems, architectures, and Joint terminal development that integrates both qualitative and quantitative engineering analyses for improved decision-making regarding the effectiveness of and return on investment (ROI) from terminal requirements. The JTEO approach to threat, vulnerability and risk assessment adapts MCSW and AFSPC enterprise risk management strategies by identifying cyberspace threats to the terminal segment and supporting the mitigation of those threats during systems engineering, development, systems integration, test and evaluation, and information assurance (IA) certification and accreditation (C&A) and supplying the results of those efforts to the enterprise. The JTEO cybersecurity initiatives support the terminal C&A process and can also support the process by which terminals may gain approval to connect to MILSATCOM systems, and potentially, through those MILSATCOM systems, to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN)/Global Information Grid (GIG). ©2010 IEEE.","Cybersecurity; Cyberspace; MILSATCOM; Network; Risk; Satellite; Space; Systems engineering; Systems integration; Terminal; Threat; Vulnerability","Accreditation; Computers; Decision making; Engineering; Iterative methods; Military communications; Military satellites; Network security; Profitability; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Satellite communication systems; Systems engineering; Cyber security; Cyberspace; MILSATCOM; Network; Space; Systems integration; Terminal; Threat; Vulnerability; Information management"

It is loss-less symmetric block cipher and specifically designed for the colour images. The initial condition & system parameter of the chaotic standard map, number of iterations and number of rounds constitute the secret key of the algorithm. Firstly we mix all three colour layers (3 D matrix) of the plain image and convert them into a 2D matrix. Each encryption round comprises of three stages: permutation rounds, substitution rounds and again permutation rounds. To increase the speed of encryption, the permutation and substitution are done row-by-row and column-by-column instead of pixel-by-pixel. The permutation process is controlled through the pseudo random number sequences (PRNS) generated from the discretization of chaotic standard map, however in the substitution, the properties of rows and column pixels of various layers are mixed with the PRNS generated from the standard map. The security of the proposed image encryption has been analyzed thoroughly using various statistical analysis, key sensitivity analysis, differential analysis, key space analysis, etc. Results suggest that the proposed image encryption technique can be used for the real time secure image and video communication applications. © 2010 IEEE.","Chaos; Cryptography; Image encryption; Image processing; Information security; Permutation-substitution","Chaotic systems; Fractals; Image processing; Imaging systems; Network security; Pixels; Random number generation; Sensitivity analysis; Standards; Three dimensional; Chaos; Chaotic standard map; Colour image; Differential analysis; Discretizations; Image and video communication; Image encryptions; Information security; Initial conditions; Key space; matrix; Number of iterations; Permutation-substitution; Pseudorandom number sequences; Real time; Secret key; Standard map; Statistical analysis; Substitution scheme; Symmetric block ciphers; Three stages; Cryptography"

The nature of the mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) makes them very vulnerable to an adversary's malicious attacks. Providing security through cryptographic algorithms in these networks is very much essential. Among all the cryptographic algorithms, encryption algorithms play a main role in information security systems. Encryption algorithms are known to be computationally intensive. They consume a significant amount of computing resources such as CPU time, memory, and battery power. A wireless device, usually with very limited resources, especially battery power, is subject to the problem of energy consumption due to encryption algorithms. Designing energy efficient security protocols first requires an understanding of and data related to the energy consumption of common encryption schemes. This paper presents a comparison of the most commonly used symmetric encryption algorithms AES (Rijndael), DES, 3DES and Blowfish in terms of power consumption. A comparison has been conducted for those encryption algorithms at different data types like text, image, audio and video.

Separation of duty (SOD) in terms of mutual exclusion and role inheritance (RI) are some of those constraints which provide security of information and make the management of security policy easy. On one side after implementing separation of duty, we may able to get tight security but on the other side it can create complexity for the security administrator and the user who uses the system. In this paper we describe the complexities and complications which can be faced after implementing separation of duty in terms of mutually exclusive roles (MER).

This can make it difficult for assessors to justify the questions and can undermine the credibility of the assessment in the eyes of the organizations assessed. This paper describes the use of assurance cases to help address these problems. Viewing an assessment approach in terms of an assurance case clarifies the underlying motivation for the assessment and supports more rigorous analysis. The paper also shows how the assurance case method has been used to guide the development of an assessment approach called the Cyber Resilience Review (CRR), developed for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. © 2010 IEEE.","Assurance cases; Critical infrastructure; Cyber resilience; Cybersecurity; Risk assessment","Motivation; Public works; Rating; Security systems; Assessment approaches; Assessment instruments; Assurance case; Critical infrastructure; Cyber resilience; Cyber security; Department of Homeland Security; Networks and systems; Rigorous analysis; Risk assessment"

The concept of Kolmogorov complexity is used in many applications like spam filtering, data compression, information assurance etc. In this paper, we present the application of Kolmogorov complexity in network security field, particularly for anomaly detection. In order to accomplish that, it is assumed that most of the network attacks change the structure of the traffic. This enforces anomaly and hence subsequent intrusion can be detected if the structure or signature of the traffic flow is investigated. From this notion, we propose a signature based anomaly detection scheme. We show through simulation results that with the help of Kolmogorov complexity, we can detect traffic pattern abnormality in a simplistic way. This detection and quantification of traffic pattern eventually lead to anomaly detection. ©2010 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; IDS; Intrusion detection; Kolmogorov complexity","Algorithms; Chemical detection; Computational complexity; Computer crime; Data compression; Network security; Parallel processing systems; Traffic surveys; Algorithmic randomness; Amount of information; Anomaly detection; IDS; Individual objects; Information assurance; Kolmogorov complexity; Network attack; Show through; Simulation result; Spam filtering; Traffic flow; Traffic pattern; Intrusion detection"

Traditionally, these Information Assurance attributes have been specified probabilistically as a belief value (or corresponding disbelief value). In this paper, we introduce a framework based on Subjective Logic that directly incorporates uncertainty by representing values as a triple of 〈belief, disbelief, uncertainty〉. This framework allows us to work with uncertainty as well as conflicting pieces of information that may arise from multiple views of an object. We also develop a formal semantic model for specifying and reasoning over Information Assurance properties in a workflow. This model uses a controlled English representation which facilitates the dialogue with domain experts to capture and vet domain knowledge. Since Data Provenance information can grow substantially as the amount of information kept for each object increases and/or as the complexity of a workflow increases, we show how this information can be summarized. This summarization can also generate a trust value in the data so that it can cross security boundaries with user-controllable covert channel implications.

The challenge is that the squad-level infantry networks typically operate at lower classification levels than the platoon command and control (C2) networks, which need information sent from below. A wearable one-way transfer (WOWT) device allows formatted position location information (PLI) to flow from an unclassified tactical radio network up to a classified C2 network. This device is designed to be worn by the squad or platoon leaders so the PLI data received from their troops can be transmitted via their classified radio to the C2 network. The MITRE team analyzed applicable information assurance (IA) policies and technical issues to create an affordable, Small Form Factor approach to move data from an unclassified radio network directly to a classified radio network without placing the secure network at risk.

This work includes the prototyping and testing of affordable ultra high frequency (UHF) radio networks capable of providing Type III secure voice and SA data to the members of a dismounted infantry squad, such as a WOWT device to forward the squad-level SA up (one way only) to a classified platoon radio network. MITRE analyzed applicable IA policies and technical issues to create an affordable approach to move data from an unclassified radio network directly to a classified radio network without putting the secure network at risk. This approach meets the full intent of IA policies and requirements, but at lower size, power, and cost than cross domain solutions (CDSs). We believe this device has immediate application to both the Army and Marine Corps, which have already fielded commercial APCO 25 radios for secure unclassified voice applications. Fielding an interim WOWT device will leverage the investments already made in these UHF APCO 25 radios and serve as an interim gap-filler until the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), the Ground Soldier System (GSS) networks, and the CDSs become available. It will also provide an architecture capable of feeding Secret platoon SA with unclassified squad-level SA. Finally, it will provide dismounted forces the opportunity to experiment with this new capability years before the Programs of Record will become available. ©2010 IEEE.","","Approximation theory; Command and control systems; Equipment; Marine applications; Military communications; Command and control; Commercial technology; Cross-domain; Dismounted infantry; Dismounted soldiers; Gap fillers; Information assurance; Joint Tactical Radio Systems; Marine Corps; Position location informations; Prototyping; Radio networks; Secure networks; Situational awareness; Small form factors; Soldier system; Tactical information; Tactical radio; Ultra-high frequency; Voice applications; Radio"

Consequently, the integration of Cyberspace Operations with Terrestrial, Afloat, Air and Space Operations has become essential to the success of those missions, and the development, fielding, and operation of those mission systems in a secure manner have become vitally important. In general, approaches to cybersecurity for mission systems and for the development infrastructure that supports the production of those systems have focused on the implementation of technology as reactive mechanisms in the operational environment. Although those technical mechanisms are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, they are not sufficient to provide the strength of protection and resiliency that is needed in today's complex and highly interconnected cyberspace domain. A more proactive approach is needed that builds in protective and resiliency mechanisms during acquisition and development, providing increased assurance that the security features, practices, procedures, and architecture of an information system are strong enough to mitigate all known operational risks, and accurately enforce Department of Defense (DoD) security policies.

Although both ICS and IT systems require information security services to combat malicious attacks, the specifics of how these services are used for the power grid depend upon appropriate risk assessment and risk control. Distinct types of attacks targeting ICS and IT systems as well as different performance requirements of these systems determine a specific priority order of the security services implemented for each system. Threat profiles of the power transmission and distribution management functions, where availability is paramount to all other security services, differ significantly from threat profiles of IT functions such as utility customer billing where confidentiality is a greater concern - hence warranting different security posturing. This paper discusses different approaches for security risk management in the context of the smart power grid. Methodologies proposed for risk assessment include threat and vulnerability modeling schemes which help in identifying and categorizing the threats, as well as in analyzing their impacts, and subsequently prioritizing them.

This case can be used as a short case illustrating how an organization can become a data breach victim, the type of data criminals are interested in stealing, how they use stolen data to commit fraud and the possible legal consequences of allowing confidential information to be stolen. To facilitate a more in-depth analysis if desired, the case and discussion questions are grouped into the following dimensions: Credit card data and processes, Credit card fraud and Identity Theft, Technical details of how the criminals accomplished the data theft and the legal aspects of the lawsuits that resulted from the data breach. Any or all of these dimensions can be explored in more depth by either the entire class or different student groups. The basic case has a difficulty level of one or two and is suitable for a general undergraduate business course. With a deeper exploration of one or more of the above dimensions the case could be used to better understand criminal data theft and fraud in an upper-level accounting or finance course. More time spent on how the data was stolen would be appropriate for an information security course, particularly with an emphasis on information technology. It could also be used in a business law or issues course to explore the legal environment surrounding data breaches, customer notification and possible legal consequences of a data breach. The basic case is designed to be taught in three class hours and is expected to require three hours of preparation by students. Case Synopsis: Hannaford Brothers Company is a regional grocery company with stores throughout eastern United States. On March 17, 2008 Hannaford Brothers announced that it had been the victim of a malware attack it characterized as ""new and sophisticated"" which resulted in over 4.2 million credit and debit card numbers being compromised. In every one of its close to 300 grocery stores in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York and Florida the malware had intercepted credit and debit card data after the customers swiped their card at the checkout counters. This stolen credit card data was fraudulently used in at least 1,800 cases in the U.S. as well as Mexico, Bulgaria and Italy. On March 19, 2008 an attorney in Maine filed a class-action lawsuit against Hannaford Brothers. Other lawsuits followed shortly. This case explores one of the most notorious data breaches of 2008 - a year which according to one report had more records compromised than the preceding four years combined. Students will learn how the data was stolen, how criminals used the stolen data to commit fraud, the security standards in place to protect data and the results of the lawsuits against Hannaford Brothers.","",""

Together, these form a framework for a socio-technical approach to information security that achieves three objectives: balancing the need to secure information assets against the need to enable the business, maintaining compliance, and ensuring cultural fit.

Each new proposal and technique arrives with great promise and anticipated success as research teams struggle to develop new and innovative responses to emerging threats. Unfortunately, these techniques frequently fall short of expectation when deployed due to difficulties with false alarms, trouble operating in a non-idealized or new domain, or flexibility limiting assumptions which are only valid with specific input sets. We believe these failures are due to fundamental problems with the experimental method for evaluating the effectiveness of new ideas and techniques. This work explores the effect of a poorly understood data synthesis process on the evaluation of IA devices. The point of an evaluation is to independently determine what a detector can and cannot detect, i.e. the metric of detection. This can only be done when the data contains carefully controlled ground truth. We broadly define the term ""similarity class"" to facilitate discussion about the different ways data (and more specifically test data) can be similar, and use these ideas to illustrate the pre-requisites for correct evaluation of anomaly detectors. We focus on how anomaly detectors function and should be evaluated in 2 specific domains with disparate system architectures and data: a sensor and data transport network for air frame tracking and display, and a deep space mission spacecraft command link. Finally, we present empirical evidence illustrating the effectiveness of our approach in these domains, and introduce the entropy of a time series sensor as a critical measure of data similarity for test data in these domains. © 2010 IEEE.","Data generation; Experimental method; Information assurance; Similarity classes","Airframes; Security systems; Space flight; Time series; Anomaly detector; Data characteristics; Data generation; Data similarity; Data synthesis; Data transport; Deep space missions; Disparate systems; Empirical evidence; Experimental methods; False alarms; Fundamental problem; Ground truth; Information assurance; Input set; Pre-requisites; Research and development; Research teams; Similarity class; Test data; Test data in; Sensors"

In ""cyber war"", those tasked with defending friendly computer networks are also expected to exploit enemy networks. This paper presents two game-theoretic models of vulnerability discovery and exploitation, where nations must choose between protecting themselves by sharing vulnerability information with vendors or pursuing an offensive advantage while remaining at risk. One game describes a cold war of stockpiling, the other allows for actual attack. In both models, we predict that at least one state will have an incentive to pursue an aggressive cyber war posture, rather than secure its own systems. This finding - that a mutually defensive approach to security is not a stable equilibrium - holds up under a range of assumptions about social risk of cybercrime, technical sophistication, military aggressiveness and the likelihood of vulnerability rediscovery.

However, detecting errors in the cybersecurity requirements, and for requirements in general, is a challenging task. In this paper we describe how computer-aided formal verification and validation can be leveraged to address the challenge of correctly capturing natural language cybersecurity requirements, converting the natural language statements into formal requirements specifications, and then checking the formal specifications to ensure that they match the original intent of the stakeholders. Our approach centers on creating a one-to-one mapping between natural language requirements and UML statechart assertions. Statechart assertions are Boolean statements about the expected behavior of the system, expressed as UML statecharts. The set of assertions created by the security or software engineer is a formal model of the system's requirements. We demonstrate our approach using examples of formally specifying and validating requirements for correct cyber system behaviors and the detection of illegal business schemes in choreographed web services. © 2010 IEEE.","Cybersecurity; Forensics; Statechart assertion; Validation; Verification","Computer crime; Crime; Errors; Security systems; Specifications; Web services; Computer assisted; Critical infrastructure; Cyber intrusion; Cyber security; Cyber systems; Cyber-attacks; Forensics; Formal model; Formal Specification; Formal verifications; Natural language requirements; Natural languages; One-to-one mappings; Requirements specifications; Software engineers; State charts; UML statecharts; Validation; Validation and verification; Security of data"

This case can be used as a short case illustrating how an organization can become a data breach victim, the type of data criminals are interested in stealing, how they use stolen data to commit fraud and the possible legal consequences of allowing confidential information to be stolen. To facilitate a more in-depth analysis if desired, the case and discussion questions are grouped into the following dimensions: Credit card data and processes, Credit card fraud and Identity Theft, Technical details of how the criminals accomplished the data theft and the legal aspects of the lawsuits that resulted from the data breach. Any or all of these dimensions can be explored in more depth by either the entire class or different student groups. The basic case has a difficulty level of one or two and is suitable for a general undergraduate business course. With a deeper exploration of one or more of the above dimensions the case could be used to better understand criminal data theft and fraud in an upper-level accounting or finance course. More time spent on how the data was stolen would be appropriate for an information security course, particularly with an emphasis on information technology. It could also be used in a business law or issues course to explore the legal environment surrounding data breaches, customer notification and possible legal consequences of a data breach. The basic case is designed to be taught in three class hours and is expected to require three hours of preparation by students. Case Synopsis: Hannaford Brothers Company is a regional grocery company with stores throughout eastern United States. On March 17, 2008 Hannaford Brothers announced that it had been the victim of a malware attack it characterized as ""new and sophisticated"" which resulted in over 4.2 million credit and debit card numbers being compromised. In every one of its close to 300 grocery stores in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York and Florida the malware had intercepted credit and debit card data after the customers swiped their card at the checkout counters. This stolen credit card data was fraudulently used in at least 1,800 cases in the U.S. as well as Mexico, Bulgaria and Italy. On March 19, 2008 an attorney in Maine filed a class-action lawsuit against Hannaford Brothers. Other lawsuits followed shortly. This case explores one of the most notorious data breaches of 2008 - a year which according to one report had more records compromised than the preceding four years combined. Students will learn how the data was stolen, how criminals used the stolen data to commit fraud, the security standards in place to protect data and the results of the lawsuits against Hannaford Brothers.","",""

Although great strides have been made in reaching the net-centric goal, full DoD SATCOM Internet Protocol (IP) convergence between the user community, the DoD SATCOM Gateways and the Defense Information Service Network [DISN] has been challenging from both a technical and Information Assurance (IA) standpoint. An additionally significant contributing factor is the exponential increase in user SATCOM capacity requirements resulting in the need for expanded Gateway capabilities. Until a full IP convergence approach is implemented throughout the DoD SATCOM Gateway enterprise, more and more legacy Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) equipment will be required at these Gateways to satisfy emerging/future user SATCOM requirements. Physical limitations exist at all the DoD Gateway sites.

To understand how organisations manage information security knowledge within policies, we consulted two information security managers in large organisations.

The same information security managers then evaluated the tool, judging it to be accessible and potentially useful in policy decision-making. © 2010 ACM.","information security ontology; ontology editor","Decision making; Human computer interaction; Information technology; Knowledge based systems; Managers; Ontology; Security systems; Societies and institutions; Collaborative development; Collaborative ontology; Editing tools; Error prones; Information security; information security ontology; Knowledge ontology; Manage information; Ontology concepts; Ontology Population; Policy decisions; Security issues; Security policy; Security of data"

The usage rage of social networking websites even exceeds that of Google. Followed by the popularity is many potential networking threats. How to prevent and improve these threats to avoid their expansion has become a major challenge. This paper categorizes social networking websites into three main structures: The social network (SN), the network application service (NAS) and the communication interface (CI). Through literacy review, we explore the potential information security threats (IST) that may lead by each layer. We then use security characteristics such as confidentiality, integrity and availability to cross-analyze these threats. The analytical results are presented by graphs and tables to demonstrate the distribution of current security threats for social networking websites. We propose a real-time website security protection mechanism based on the concept of proxy. The client side transmits information to the social networking website through proxy. The main function of the proxy is to detect and determine the security threats of the website. These threats include web-based malware, phishing websites and malicious connection. The idea is to integrate many commercial protection software and online security scanning services into a security module, simultaneously execute webpage security threat scan, then scan the information sent by the web server with the security module before sending to the client. If security threats were found in the web page, the system will add this web page to the blacklist and issue a warning to the client side to prevent attack. The functionality of proxy is to segregate the client and the networking threat. Using simultaneous scan of many protection software and online services can increase the recognition rate of security threats. Later one, as long as the client is to receive the webpage in the blacklist, a warning will be issued directly to the client side. Through this mechanism, we can lower the security risk of the clients using social networking websites. ©2010 IEEE.","Facebook; Information security; Personal data; Proxy; Social networking website","Computer crime; Security systems; Social networking (online); World Wide Web; Facebook; Information security; Personal data; Proxy; Social networking; Security of data"

In GSM mobile standard, A5/1 stream cipher is used to provide security over-the-air voice transmissions. It is strong encryption algorithm among the cryptographic algorithms used in GSM. However, it is cryptanalized by a number of attacks. Recent studies show that it has serious security weaknesses in its architecture. In this paper, an enhanced version of A5/1 stream cipher to improve the security of A5/1 scheme is presented. Enhancements are made in clocking mechanism and combining function of the cipher. The proposed scheme is coded in VHDL. NIST Statistical test package is used to evaluate the randomness performance of output bit-streams of two ciphers. The randomness results show that the output bit-stream generated by the proposed stream cipher has better randomness performance. © 2010 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Global system for mobile communications; Grid computing; Hydraulics; Random processes; Security of data; Statistical tests; Cryptographic algorithms; Encryption algorithms; GSM mobiles; Information security; ITS architecture; Mobile communication networks; Secure communications; Secure mobile communications; Security weakness; Stream Ciphers; Voice transmissions; Cryptography"

During the attack actions, the attacker must allocate a limited budget to collect a large enough number of shares and decrypted keys through compromising certain nodes.

An image encryption algorithm based on DNA sequences for the big image is presented in this paper. The main purpose of this algorithm is to reduce the big image encryption time. This algorithm is implemented by using the natural DNA sequences as main keys. The first part is the process of pixel scrambling. The original image is confused in the light of the scrambling sequence is generated by the DNA sequence. The second part is the process of pixel replacement. The pixel gray values of the new image and the one of the three encryption templates are generated by the other DNA sequence are XORed bit-by-bit in turn.

When a computer is subject to forensic examination, information may be found that cannot be readily ascribed to a specific user. Such information is typically not located in a specific file or directory, but is found through file carving, which recovers data from unallocated disk sectors. Because the data is carved, it does not have associated file system metadata, and its owner cannot be readily ascertained. The technique presented in this paper starts by automatically recovering both file system metadata as well as extended metadata embedded in files (for instance, embedded timestamps) directly from a disk image. This metadata is then used to find exemplars and to create a machine learning classifier that can be used to ascertain the likely owner of the carved data. The resulting classifier is well suited for use in a legal setting since the accuracy can be easily verified using cross-validation. Our technique also results in a classifier that is easily validated by manual inspection. We report results of the technique applied to both specific hard drive data created in our laboratory and multiuser drives that we acquired on the secondary market.

The Net Present Value (NPV), and discounted Return on Investment (dRoI) models are proposed for the execution of cost-benefit analysis. Since fuzzy results are in the form of a complex nonlinear representation, and do not always provide a totally ordered set in the same way that crisp numbers do, the current paper approximates the resulting fuzzy profitability indexes by a triangular fuzzy number initially, and then uses the Mellin Transform to obtain the means and variances of the triangle fuzzy numbers in order to determine their relative ranking in a decision-making process. The performances of the proposed models are verified by considering their application to a practical illustration, which were used in a previous literature. These investigations not only confirm that the results of the fuzzy economic models are consistent with those of the conventional crisp models, but also demonstrate that the proposed models are more flexible, intelligent and computationally efficient compared to the extension principle fuzzy mathematics approach. The developed models represent readily implemented feasibility analysis tools for use in the arena of uncertain economic decision-making.","Decision-making; Fuzzy economics; Information security investment; Mellin transform; Risk management","Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy sets; Instruments; Investments; Measurements; Profitability; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security of data; Benefit analysis; Computationally efficient; Crisp models; Crisp numbers; Decision making process; Developed model; Economic decision-making; Economic decisions; Economic feasibilities; Economic models; Extension principles; Feasibility analysis; Fuzzy economics; Fuzzy mathematics; Information security investment; Mellin transform; Net present value; Ordered set; Relative rankings; Return on investments; Triangle fuzzy numbers; Triangular fuzzy numbers; Decision making"

Access graphs have been proposed to model trust between systems and also show how a compromised system can affect related systems. This paper introduces a framework for evaluating the security exposure of a large scale smart grid environment. The framework utilizes a model based on access graphs to determine the system's attack exposure. This method also implements quantitative metrics to evaluate acceptable exposure levels.

Despite facilitating information flow, passive response exposes the assets to attacks while the security analysts investigate the alarms. On the other hand, active response may unnecessarily delay the benign traffic since alarm events are blocked. We find closed-form formulas for the optimal investigation capacity and show the optimal configuration under active response is smaller than under passive response.

In this paper, we first analyzed the characteristics of data and security problems in DIS network. For the real-time interactive data in DIS network, a stream cipher algorithm based on Logistic chaotic map (Logistic-EA) was presented. In this algorithm, the key stream was generated by Logistic chaotic map. The ciphertext was gotten by executing XOR operation of plaintext and key stream. Logistic-EA has high security level and high encryption speed. For the non-real-time data, a hybrid encryption algorithm based on the chaos theory and AES (Chaos-AES) was presented. In this algorithm, the initial key and round key were generated by logistic chaotic map. Chaos-AES increased key space and implemented one-time pad. So that the ciphertext encrypted by this algorithm is harder to break. The experiment results indicate that the algorithms above are effective in the DIS network. © 2010 IEEE.","AES; Data encryption; Logistic chaotic map; Simulation network","Algorithms; Chaotic systems; Computer simulation; Hydraulics; Network security; AES; Ciphertexts; Data encryption; Distributed interactive simulation; High security levels; Hybrid encryption; Information security; Key space; Logistic chaotic map; Network applications; Plaintext; Real-time data; Round key; Security problems; Simulation network; Stream Ciphers; XOR operation; Cryptography"

The decision however, on which particular security metrics to use, is surprisingly often based on an uninformed process and disregards the company's security goals and capabilities. Like a factory owner, who bought a new tool, without considering which business goals it should support and whether the staff is actually equipped to operate it, introducing metrics without considering security goals and security capabilities can lead to ineffective operation. Practitioners complain in this context about their security metrics being too complex to use, requiring data that is expensive to gather, or simply measuring the wrong thing. Existing frameworks such as the SSE-CMM or ISO 27000 series provide generic guidance on choosing security objectives and metrics, but lack a method to guide companies in choosing the security metrics that best fit their unique security objectives and capabilities. In response to this problem we present a method with a tool that supports matching security metrics with the objectives and capabilities of a company. Our method helps companies in deciding which metric best suits their particular context, by determining which metric is 1.) efficient to apply using a companies given capabilities and 2.) provides the maximum contribution to the company's security objectives. The method is supported by existing research in the field of value-based software engineering and has been developed based on the established ""Quality Function Deployment"" (QFD) approach. Initial experiences from applying the method suggest that the method improves the selection process off security metrics. © 2010 ACM.","business-driven ITSM; security management; security metrics","Coordinate measuring machines; Industrial management; Industry; Quality function deployment; Software engineering; Best fit; Business goals; Business perspective; business-driven ITSM; Field of values; Information security; Information security managements; Security capability; Security goals; Security management; security metrics; Security objectives; Selection process; SSE-CMM; Security of data"

The proposed approach would provide timely and quantitative assessments of the vulnerability of network-centric systems as they progress through development, prior to full-rate production, and after fielding. The motivation rests on the proposition that vulnerabilities associated with computer networks have many similarities to vulnerabilities on conventional weapon system platforms. However, the vulnerabilities of networked environments have their own unique challenges. In particular, while sophisticated kinetic threats are relatively static, the network threat has changed significantly over the past decade, and continues to change as new technologies are developed and fielded. The identities, motivations, objectives, targets, and tactics of the threat agents are constantly changing. Unlike many kinetic threats, the tools of network malicious activities are inexpensive and deployable from almost anywhere. To complicate matters the most serious network threat is not a denial of service or a major disruption in the network, but rather one in which the adversaries are able to maintain the integrity of the network while manipulating mission data and applications. When adversaries are able to penetrate without affecting the network it becomes very difficult to detect and react to the threat. Operators and organizations must be able to fight through such attacks, but currently system operators are not armed with the proper knowledge or processes defined to defend against these attacks. And in many cases, the systems are not designed to detect such attacks. In this paper we describe a series of proposed steps to systematically assess any vulnerability a new system might bring to a network environment, estimate which of those vulnerabilities might be susceptible to postulated threat exploitations, then develop and test recovery mechanisms. Results of such tests should allow management to evaluate system protection and detection features, as well as the ability of operators to react and recover from attacks. In the summer of 2008, we applied these steps to plan and conduct a small demonstration test at the Air Force's 46th Test Squadron. Then in the summer of 2009 we conducted a tabletop exercise at United States Joint Forces Command to build on the previous summer's results. In this paper we will discuss results of these activities as well as our assessments of the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed approach.","","Military aviation; Military communications; Motivation; Air Force; Combat effectiveness; Conventional weapons; Demonstration Tests; Denial of Service; Full-rate production; Information assurance; Joint forces; Malicious activities; Network environments; Network threats; Network-centric system; Networked environments; New system; New technologies; Quantitative assessments; Recovery mechanisms; System operator; System protection; Tabletop exercise; Threat agents; Network security"

At encryption stage, a 128-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) feature vector is firstly extracted from the face image. And a 128 bit binary vector is obtained by thresholding. Then we select the distinguishable bits to form biokey and the optimal bit order number is saved in a look-up table. Furthermore, an error-correct-code (ECC) is generated using Reed-Solomon algorithm. The message is encrypted using symmetric DES with bio-key. In decryption phase, a 128- dimensional PCA features vector extracted from the query face image. Then a bio-key is generated using the look-up table generated at encryption stage. The final key is obtained using both bio-key and Error correct code (ECC). Finally, the symmetric DES decryption algorithm implemented to obtain message using final key. The proposed scheme is tested using ORL face database, the experimental results shows that our algorithm is effective. © 2010 IEEE.","Bio-key; Biometric encryption; Error-correct-code; Key-generation","Algorithms; Biometrics; Face recognition; Principal component analysis; Public key cryptography; Signal processing; Table lookup; Binary vectors; Bio-key; Biometric encryption; Cryptographic key; Cryptographic methods; Cryptosystems; Decryption algorithm; Error correct code; Face features; Face images; Feature vectors; Features vector; Information security; Key-generation; Look up table; ORL face database; Reed solomon; Thresholding; Security of data"

We formally resolve uncertainty by means of a probability distribution on risk parameters that is common knowledge to all players. To illustrate how this approach might yield fruitful applications, we postulate a well-motivated distribution, compute Bayesian Nash equilibria and tipping conditions for the derived model, and compare these with the analogous conditions for the original IDS model. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","","Decision theory; Game theory; Probability distributions; Decision theory; Game theory; Network security; Probability distributions; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Common knowledge; Information security; Risk parameter; Security threats; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Common knowledge; Risk parameter; Security games; Security threats; Security of data; Security of data"

Further, each Information Assurance attribute may itself have sub-components like objective and subjective values or application security versus transport security. Traditionally, the Information Assurance attributes have been specified probabilistically as a belief value (or corresponding disbelief value) in that Information Assurance attribute. In this paper we introduce a framework based on Subjective Logic that incorporates uncertainty by representing values as a triple of <belief, disbelief, uncertainty>. This framework also allows us to work with conflicting Information Assurance attribute values that may arise from multiple views of an object. We also introduce a formal semantic model for specifying and reasoning over Information assurance properties in a workflow. Data Provenance information can grow substantially as the amount of information kept for each object increases as well as the complexity of a workflow increases. In such situations, it may be necessary to summarize the Data Provenance information. Further, the summarization may depend on the Information Assurance attributes as well as the type of analysis used for Data Provenance. We show how such summarization can be done and how it can be used to generate trust value in the data. We also discuss how the Information Assurance values can be visualized. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","confidence; data provenance; Figure of Merit; information assurance; semantic model; subjective logic; trust; uncertainty framework","Management; Metadata; Semantics; Artificial intelligence; Computers; confidence; Data provenance; Figure of merit; Information assurance; semantic model; Subjective Logic; trust; uncertainty framework; Confidence; Data provenance; Figure of merits; Information assurance; Semantic Model; Subjective Logic; Trust; Uncertainty framework; Security of data; Semantics"

While it is well-known that such signal processing hardware needs to be implemented under tight area and power constraints, new design requirements emerge with their increasing complexity. Use of nanoscale technology shows tremendous benefits in implementing these advanced circuits due to dramatic improvement in integration density and power dissipation per operation. However, it also brings in new challenges such as reliability and large idle power (due to higher leakage current). Besides, programmability of the device as well as security of the recorded information are rapidly becoming major design considerations of such systems. In this paper, we analyze the emerging issues associated with the design of the DSP unit in an implantable system. Next, we propose a novel ultra light-weight solution to address the information security issue. Unlike the conventional information security approaches like data encryption, which come at large area and power overhead and hence are not amenable for resource-constrained implantable systems, we propose a multilevel key-based scrambling algorithm, which exploits the nature of the biological signal to effectively obfuscate it. Analysis of the proposed algorithm in the context of neural signal processing and its hardware implementation shows that we can achieve high level of security with ∼ 13X lower power and ∼ 5X lower area overhead than conventional cryptographic solutions. © 2010 IEEE.","","Electronics; Equipment Design; Prostheses and Implants; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Algorithms; Cryptography; Design; Hardware; Nanotechnology; Network security; Real time systems; Signal processing; Area overhead; Biological signals; Data encryption; Design considerations; Design issues; Hardware implementations; Implantable system; In-situ analysis; Information security; Integration density; Nanoscale technologies; Neural signal processing; New design; Power constraints; Power dissipation; Power overhead; Processing hardware; Programmability; Recorded signals; Resource-constrained; Scrambling algorithm; Security solutions; Ultra-light; article; electronics; equipment; equipment design; methodology; prostheses and orthoses; signal processing; In situ processing"

Too often private interests place security low on the list of priorities, especially when not encouraged by government entities. Yet for African networks to be safe, it will be essential for manufacturers and providers to offer adequate security. Steps such as encrypting all sensitive data passed through the network and ensuring the privacy of personal information offer adequate user protection. African governments must also find ways to train information security professionals. While increasing this work force will certainly carry a high cost to governments that often have little money to spend, the costs otherwise will be far greater, although distributed more broadly among the population. Beyond Africa, mobile phone security must be raised in the consciousness of Western professionals and the international bodies studying and working in the field of information security. By raising awareness across the globe, we have a far greater chance of motivating sustainable international assistance. Finally, an African public awareness campaign is vital. As individuals begin to use more powerful devices in more powerful ways, it is essential that these users understand the potentially detrimental effects that lurk unseen. The compelling rise of mobile telephony across Africa is not a passing phenomenon. While restraints for future growth do exist, the power, accessibility, and affordability of the devices make them an irresistible force in the coming decade.

Very soon a majority of Africans will be using mobile phones for banking, accessing the Internet, facilitating commerce, and general communication.

Since then it has become an essential part of our collective consciousness. It symbolises the uninhibited exploitation by a powerful elite, which is achieved by practically unlimited microscopic intervention into all areas of our lives. To illustrate this, Orwell created the idea of newspeak, and the telescreen which made it possible to observe (interception) others' thoughts. The purpose of this essay is to draw attention to the disturbing fact that Orwell's 60 years old dystopia is an everyday reality of the 21st century's e-society. This is demonstrated both in documentary evidence and in scientific and technological developments. Moreover, the technological developments of the 20th century, unimaginable to Orwell, have exceeded the original dystopia: today's reality includes ECHELON, Carnivore, RFID; in other words GLOBAL BIG BROTHER. We need to realise that the war on terror, enhanced electronic security and e-democracy are empty slogans that together lead humankind towards dependence unprecedented in human history. The mass of information can become the magical weapon in the hands of authority, allowing it to manipulate the peaceful 99.9% of society as marionettes, while using the restraint of the 0.1% as an excuse. The magical weaponof information is more evil than all the physical, chemical and biological weapons known, because its destruction is invisible: it is the destruction of the human mind and personality, and of human independence.","Big Brother; Carnivore; e-society; ECHELON; information security; information society; RFID",""

Compared with conventional mathematical encryption methods optical security system provides higher processing speed, more information volume, more encryption free-degree as well as its multi-dimension and parallel processing abilities. In this paper we proposed a novel architecture for optical image encryption with polarization-selective diffractive optical element (PDOE) based on interference theory. A target image is firstly encoded into two phase-only distributions and then these phase distributions are encrypted into the etched surface-relief pattern of a single PDOE mask. In the process of optical image decryption, when the working wavelength and the system configuration are correct, the PDOE mask with the encoded information for the target image can generate two desired polarized wavefronts by modulating the incident light beam. These two wavefronts interfere and then generate the decrypted image. The encoding algorithm to generate the phase-only distributions is simple and it does not need iterative process. The optical realization for image decryption also has the advantages of easier installation and collimation since all the optical elements are in a same optical axis. The employment of the PDOE mask in this optical security system will highly increase the information security and still maintain the parameter sensitivity in an acceptable region. Numerical simulation is performed to demonstrate the validity of this new proposed method. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","interference; Optical security; polarization-selective diffractive optical element","Cryptography; Density (optical); Diffractive optical elements; Geometrical optics; Network security; Numerical methods; Occupational risks; Optical data processing; Polarization; Security systems; Wavefronts; Data security; Encoded information; Encoding algorithms; Encryption methods; Etched surface; Image decryptions; Incident light beams; Information security; interference; Interference theory; Iterative process; Novel architecture; Numerical simulation; Optical axis; Optical elements; Optical image; Optical image encryption; Optical realization; Optical security; Optical security systems; Optical theory; Parallel processing; Parameter sensitivities; Phase distribution; Phase-only; Processing speed; Relief patterns; System configurations; Target images; Two phase; Optical data storage"

Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. For instance, companies operating critical infrastructures have integrated control systems with the Internet to reduce near-term, measurable costs while raising the risk of catastrophic failures, whose losses will be primarily borne by society. As long as anti-virus software is left to individuals to purchase and install, there may be a less than optimal level of protection when infected machines cause trouble for other machines rather than their owners. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability and increasing crime, policy and legislation must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so. In this paper, we examine the economic challenges that plague cybersecurity: misaligned incentives, information asymmetries, and externalities. We then discuss the regulatory options that are available to overcome these barriers in the cybersecurity context: ex ante safety regulation, ex post liability, information disclosure, and indirect intermediary liability. Finally, we make several recommendations for policy changes to improve cybersecurity: mitigating malware infections via ISPs by subsidized cleanup, mandatory disclosure of fraud losses and security incidents, mandatory disclosure of control system incidents and intrusions, and aggregating reports of cyber espionage and providing them to the World Trade Organization (WTO). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Economics; Externalities; Incentives; Information asymmetries; Information security; Intermediary liability; Malware; Payment card security","Computer crime; Control systems; Crime; Economics; Electronic commerce; International trade; Internet service providers; Product liability; Externalities; Incentives; Information asymmetry; Information security; Intermediary liability; Malwares; Payment card; Security of data"

Protecting the information during communication via the internet is the major challenge against eavesdropper. Encryption is a widely used technique to ensure secure communication; however, sending encrypted messages often draws an eavesdropper's attention. Steganography is a method of writing secret messages in a way that nobody, except for the sender and the recipient, suspects the existence of a hidden message. In this paper a new steganographic technique is proposed to transmit concealed messages in multi-language or combination of languages, which can be represented in Unicode. Use of intercharacter spacing technique is proposed as the steganographic technique and a prototype implementation has been done with Rich Text Format (RTF) documents. An additional optimized compression technique is also proposed with enhanced user defined codes, to support Unicode language. Another advantage is that the secret message (hidden) can be in a different language than which is transmitted through the communication channel. ©2010 IEEE.","Encryption; Security; Steganography; Unicode","Communication; Computer crime; Internet; Network security; Steganography; Communication channel; Compression techniques; Cybercrime; Encrypted messages; Encryption; Hidden messages; Information security; Language independents; Prototype implementations; Radical growth; Rich text formats; Secret messages; Secure communications; Security; Unicodes; Cryptography"

Fuzzy vault is a widely accepted scheme binding biometric data and cryptography effectively. Polynomial projection is often used in the implementation of fuzzy vault. However, the drawback of polynomial projection is that the increase of key length would lead to a higher degree of polynomial, reconstruction of which would cause poor convergence in practice. To resolve the problem, we propose a new fuzzy vault method based on cubic spline interpolation. The piecewise low-degree polynomial of spline interpolation could overcome poor convergence problem and much longer key could be generated. Because the security of the fuzzy vault arises from the number of chaff points in the vault, the same security level could be guaranteed compared to polynomial reconstruction based fuzzy vault. Experimental results based on HA-BJTU palmprint database show the feasibility of the proposed method and performances are satisfied. © 2010 IEEE.","Biometric cryptosystem; Cubic spline interpolation; Fuzzy vault; Palmprint; Polynomial reconstruction","Anthropometry; Artificial intelligence; Biometrics; Cryptography; Polynomials; Security of data; Splines; Cryptosystems; Cubic-spline interpolation; Fuzzy vault; Palmprints; Polynomial reconstruction; Interpolation"

This paper focuses on the study of the speed of detection, which is so far the most challenging problems in network intrusion detection. In practice, double-array hashing space method is applied in order to solve the problem of the big hashing space; according to features of data-package and those of attack-string, hashing-function is selected because of its high speed and efficiency; and the speed of detection is improve through the decrdasd of the times of detection to network package by applying various characteristic-string of the sane length with their corresponding pattern. There are many methods to achieve network security, and intrusion detection technology is a very effective mechanism [1]. It is a technology that could detect the current attack or attack happening inside computer system. At present, there are several different pattern match algorithms that are used for the attack detection of effective load for packet. No matter what optimization is made, they all could not get rid of a weakness: must match item by item for each mode that indicates attack characteristics [2-5]. So the packet to be detected shall be scanned for many times, and the scanning time is equal to the quality of mode; meanwhile, detection system also establish and manage heuristic function for each attack mode, and adjust detection order of attack mode, so system has rather big burden, and has difficulty to promote the detection efficiency. This is the fundamental problem causing low detection efficiency of effective load of packet [6]. Is it possible to design a detection algorithm which could build heuristic function from the perspective of whole attack model base and could detect all the attack models at the same time? This article uses hashing-method to discuss this problem, and finds that the attack probably existing could be found by several scanning for packet. In addition, network intrusion detection rule base is network IDS detection engine using model matching detection method, which is the standard for checking the captured packet. Snort is intrusion detection system based on network. This description method is simple, easy to achieve, and could describe most of the intrusion activities. Therefore, this article adopts the intrusion activity description method of Snort intrusion detection system, and introduces the rule base of Snort intrusion detection system as the rule base of this article for the foundation of design and demonstration of hashing detection scheme. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.","Hashing-method BM algorithm; Intrusion detection","Computer crime; Heuristic algorithms; Manufacture; Model checking; Network security; Problem solving; Technology; Attack detection; Attack model; Computer users; Description method; Detection algorithm; Detection efficiency; Detection methods; Detection scheme; Detection system; Effective mechanisms; Fundamental problem; Hashing-method BM algorithm; Heuristic functions; High speed; High-speed processing; Information security; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion detection technologies; Model matching; Network IDS; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusion detection systems; Pattern match; Rule base; Scanning time; Intrusion detection"

Determining the appropriate controls for any particular device first requires identifying its place within an established trust model. This paper aims to define a multilevel framework for a trust model to be used throughout the electrical grid. Assume compromise of control systems - A primary objective in developing this model is to support a distributed rather than hierarchical control system architecture based on the core assumption that the compromise of grid control system components and subsystems will always be to some extent unavoidable. Rather, therefore, than attempting to create an all-encompassing enclave of trust, our control system architectural model suggests that systems be designed in ways to narrow the sphere of implied trust by expecting the compromise of adjacent systems, thereby reducing the sphere of vulnerability. By starting with an expectation of control system component compromise or lack of trust, subsystem designs can be implemented with independent rather than dependent cyber security and energy control data flows. The term High Assurance Smart Grid (HASG) refers to a Smart Grid with a control system architecture characterized by a distributed architecture that is designed to mitigate against widespread failures when control system components themselves are compromised. Lessons-learned and best practices are adopted from power engineering, information technology, cyber security, and other disciplines to build the described HASG model. ©2010 IEEE.","Cyber security; Information assurance; Smart grid; Standards; Trust model","Communication; Control theory; Hierarchical systems; Network architecture; Remote control; Spheres; Architectural models; Best-practices; Communications networks; Control system architecture; Cyber security; Distributed architecture; Electrical grids; Energy control; Grid control; Hierarchical control systems; High assurance; Information assurance; Power engineering; Primary objective; Sensors and actuators; Smart grid; Subsystem design; System components; Trust models; Security of data"

Concurrently the vision of what cyber security means is itself changing. The US Department of Defense (henceforth DoD) has recently promulgated a new doctrine of mission assurance in contrast to the earlier approach of information assurance. We argue that this concept of mission assurance is equally applicable to the commercial sector, and has high relevance to the availability and security concerns of cloud computing. While the business community may prefer alternate terms such as ""business application assurance,"" ""business function assurance"" or ""mission effectiveness"" we propose to stay with established DoD terminology. Our basic position is that in order to achieve mission assurance in the new paradigm of cloud computing we need to instrument the cloud with hooks and supporting protocols and mechanisms to enable deployment of mission-driven performance, resilience and security policies into the computing and communication infrastructure. The cloud must therefore evolve from its current mission-oblivious state to become mission-aware.

Fuzzy vault is a widely accepted scheme that binding biometric data and cryptography effectively. In vault encoding, random chaff points which are not on the polynomial are added to protect genuine points. In vault decoding, query biometric data is generated to retrieve the genuine points by measuring the distance between the registered data and query data. However, because of the within-class differences and randomness of chaff points, it is difficult to distinguish the genuine data from chaff data. This paper proposes a novel 3D fuzzy vault scheme that selects unused data from template feature vector and inserts it into the genuine points. In our scheme, every point in the vault has three dimensions, two of which could be used for distance measurement. The precision of the data matching is improved by the new inserted data and genuine points could be recognized more accurately. Experimental results based on HA-BJTU database show the better performances compared to traditional fuzzy vault. © 2010 IEEE.","3D fuzzy vault; Biometric cryptosystems; Distance measurement; Palmprint","Anthropometry; Biometrics; Cryptography; Distance measurement; Three dimensional; Biometric data; Cryptosystems; Data matching; Feature vectors; Fuzzy vault; Fuzzy vault scheme; Information security; Palmprints; Three dimensions; Security of data"

From the definition of DDoS, thousands of network attacks must initiate simultaneously and continuously to achieve a successful DDoS attacking. Therefore, almost all of the information system cannot survive as they confront the DDoS attacks. Although there are a lot of intrusion detection system (IDS) developed, preventing DDoS attack is still difficult and perplexing. In this paper, an early warning system for detecting DDoS attacking has been mounted to a traditional IDS to form a completely system. This early warning system is developed based on the rationale of time delay neural network. In the networking topology, each node is monitored with the deployment of detectors to establish a multilayer architecture. In addition, the activities of each node will be monitored by their neighboring nodes to check whether it is still survival or not mutually. After then, all of the attacking information will be collected and transferred to the expert module for integrating analysis. As those nodes dispatched on the DMZ or between the first and second layer of firewall face some attacking similar as the pattern of DDoS, the kernel expert module which dispatched behind the second firewall will take some feasible actions and initiate the defense strategies to protect the kernel information system. In the meanwhile, those failed nodes will be restarted and act as the role of vanguard to assure the networking under normal operation. © 2010 IEEE.","Denial of service; Distributed denial of service; Information security; Internet hacking; Time-delay neural network","Computer crime; Information systems; Internet; Intrusion detection; Multilayers; Multimedia signal processing; Network security; Personal computing; Signal detection; Signal processing; Time delay; Transmission control protocol; DDoS Attack; Defense strategy; Denial of Service; Distributed Denial of Service; Early Warning System; Failed nodes; Information security; Intrusion detection systems; Multilayer architecture; Neighboring nodes; Network attack; Normal operations; Second layer; Time delay neural networks; Neural networks"

In order to detect them, many existing run-time intrusion or malware detection techniques utilize information available in Application Programming Interface (API) call sequences to discriminate between benign and malicious processes. Although some great progresses have been made, the new research results of ensemble learning make it possible to design better malware detection algorithm. This paper present a novel approach of detecting malwares using API call sequences. Basing on the fact that the API call sequences of a software show local property when doing network, file IO and other operations, we first divide the API call sequences of a malware into seven subsequences, and then use each subsequence to build a classification model. After these building models are used to classify software, their outputs are combined by using BKS and the final fusion results will be used to label whether a software is malicious or not. Experiments show that our algorithm can detect known malware effectively. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","API Call Sequences; BKS Algorithm; Malware Detection; Multi-view Fusion","Algorithms; Computer crime; Data processing; Intrusion detection; Signal detection; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Signal detection; API calls; BKS Algorithm; Building model; Classification models; Ensemble learning; Information assurance; Local property; Malicious codes; Malware detection; Malwares; Multi-views; Research results; Runtimes; API calls; Classification models; Ensemble learning; Information assurance; Malicious codes; Malware detection; Multi-views; Research results; Application programming interfaces (API); Malware"

However, it is noted that still the majority of organizations does not know the dominant security standards or does not fully implement them. The aim of this paper is to facilitate the awareness of information security practitioners regarding globally known and accepted security standards, and thus, contribute to their adoption. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a conceptual approach and results in a classification framework for categorizing available information security standards. The classification framework is built in four layers of abstraction, where the initial layer is founded in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 information security management system. Findings: The paper presents a framework for conceptualizing, categorizing and interconnecting available information security standards dynamically. Research limitations/implications: The completeness of the information provided in the paper relies on the pace of standards' publications; thus the information security standards that have been classified in this paper need to be updated when new standards are published. However, the proposed framework can be utilized for this constant effort. Practical implications: Information security practitioners can benefit by the proposed framework for available security standards and effectively invoke the relevant standard each time. Guidelines for utilizing the proposed framework are presented through a case study. Originality/value: Although the practices proposed are not innovative by themselves, the originality of this work lies on the best practices' linkage into a coherent framework that can facilitate the standards diffusion and systematic adoption. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Best practice; Data security; International standards","Management; Standards; Best-practices; Classification framework; Coherent frameworks; Data security; Design/methodology/approach; Information security; Information security management systems; International standards; ISO/IEC; Security standards; Security of data"

The goal is to make the most out of the available budget and to achieve a balanced overall security level. This leads to maximize the investment outcome. Many existing information security risk assessment approaches identify and assess risks to critical assets and are asset-driven approaches. These are limited in that it is hard to keep track of dependencies between assets and to produce realistic estimates of their values to an organization. We present a new security risk assessment approach focusing on business goals rather than assets and the processes supporting or contributing to these goals. Risks are identified and evaluated on a business process level and aggregated over all such processes depending on their criticality, role and importance for the organization as a whole. We illustrate our approach using examples from the banking industry, as well as discuss how our approach deals with some of the ambiguities involved in expert intensive and asset-driven information security risk assessment. © 2010 IEEE.","Business process; Information management; Information security; Process management; Risk assessment; Risk management","Budget control; Information management; Network security; Rating; Risk analysis; Risk management; Banking industry; Business goals; Business Process; Critical asset; Information security; Information security risk assessment; Limited information; Process management; Security level; Security requirements; Security risk assessments; Risk assessment"

This paper introduces the idea of CVSS-host scores which utilize CVSS parameters to provide impact scoring for individual systems. This scoring mechanism presents a novel view of system risk by framing an upper bounds on the criticality of potential vulnerabilities in that system. Once this scoring system has been established, the CVSS vectors can then be utilized to perform more sophisticated calculations to investigate optimal costs and benefits for future security enhancements. The benefits of this risk assessment mechanism are displayed against an example smart grid AMI architecture as documented in NIST IR 7628. The contributions of the paper are 1) the introduction of CVSS-host scoring, 2) the analysis of NIST AMI proposed architectures through the CVSS-host scoring method and 3) a binary integer program formulation for utilizing CVSS-host scoring to evaluate optimal security configurations. ©2010 IEEE.","","Architecture; Integer programming; Optimization; Risk assessment; Assessment mechanism; Binary integers; Cost effective; Cyber security; Individual systems; Optimal costs; Optimal security; Proposed architectures; Risk optimization; Scoring methods; Scoring systems; Security enhancements; Security mechanism; Smart grid; System risk; Upper Bound; Innovation"

It is expected that DNA computing can offer effective solutions to difficult-to-solve problems for the conventional computing. On the other hand troublesome procedures to read out the calculation results prevent the realization of practical applications of DNA computing. Here we propose a new tile sequencing method to read out the DNA tile computing results using a visualization tile. We verify its effectiveness by applying to DNA-based one-time pad (OTP) cryptosystem and clarify the problems to be resolved to provide the practical applications. It is known that OTP serves a theoretically-unbreakable cryptosystem if the random key is truly random, never reused, and kept secret. DNA hybridization process can be a physical random source required for true-random-key generation. Because a mathematical algorithm can generate pseudo-random numbers only, DNA computing will realize a next-generation cryptosystem that integrates a self-supported true random number generator. Our results indicate that the tile sequencing will be able to provide a new label and amplification free convenient high-throughput readout system for DNA tile computing, when it is combined with the multi-layer algorithm. Our new readout method will promote the progress of DNA logical computation and expand the possibility of its practical applications. © 2010 IEEE.","Algorithmic self-assembly; DNA computing; DNA-based cryptography; One-time pads","Algorithms; Calculations; Computation theory; Cryptography; DNA; Gene encoding; Number theory; Readout systems; Security of data; Self assembly; Visualization; Cryptosystems; DNA computing; DNA hybridization; DNA tile; Effective solution; High-throughput; Information security; Key generation; Mathematical algorithms; One-time pads; Pseudo-random numbers; Random number generators; Random sources; Sequencing method; Random number generation"

Our schemes generate a secret One Time Pad (OTP) shared by the sender and the receiver, from a large number of public random bits produced by the sender or by an external source. Our schemes initially generate a small number of shared secret bits, using known techniques. We introduce a new method to expand a small number of shared bits to a much longer, shared key. Our schemes are tailored to the requirements of sensor nodes and wireless networks. They are simple, efficient to implement and take advantage of the fact that practical wireless protocols transmit data in frames, unlike previous protocols, which assume access to specific bits in a stream of data. Indeed, our main contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we construct schemes that are attractive in terms of simplicity, computational complexity, number of bits read from the shared random source and expansion factor of the initial key to the final shared key. On the other hand, we show how to transformany existing scheme for key exchange in BSM into a more efficient scheme in the number of bits it reads from the shared source, given that the source is transmitted in frames.","Bounded storage model; Information theoretic security; Wireless network","Computational complexity; Information theory; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Bounded storage model; Expansion factors; External sources; Information security; Information-theoretic security; Key exchange; Limited storage; One time pads; Random bits; Random sequence; Random sources; Shared secrets; Transmit data; Wireless protocol; Network security"

From time in memorial authentication schemes that apply strong text-based passwords have been typically expected to offer some assurance of security. But committing to memory such strong passwords can prove to be quite a daunting task thus forcing users to resort to writing them down on pieces of papers or even storing them onto a computer file. As a means of thwarting such habits, graphical authentication has been proposed as a replacement for textbased authentication. This has been spurred by the fact the humans have a natural inclination to remember images more easily than text. Most Information Communication and Telecommunication (ICT) environments in the last 20 years have tried to implement graphical user authentication schemes. The effectiveness of a graphical password is measured by its level of usability and security. Despite there being many existing algorithms most have failed to achieve both aspects simultaneously. To start with this paper reviews the pure and cued recall-based algorithms graphical password authentication schemes together with their shortcomings and probable attacks. Thereafter a comparative analysis of all Recall-Based algorithms based on attack patterns of graphical user authentication is tabulated. This is then followed by a discussion on the newly proposed algorithm that is based on a multi size grid and its evaluation by an attacker team. Finally, a comparison of the newly proposed algorithm and previous algorithms will be evaluated in a table. © 2010 Academic Journals.","Attack patterns; Cued recall-based algorithm; Graphical password; Pure recall-based algorithm; Recall-based GUA; Security; Usability",""

Most of the organizations which were not have enough resources and expertise outsource their ICT project to vendors. Conversely, the strategy could also contribute to some risks especially information security risks that could expose organizational information assets directly involved with ICT services at risks. An appropriate information security risk management (ISRM) in ICT outsourcing should be in place to facilitate efficiency of practices how to manage information security risks in ICT outsourcing. The objective of this research is to conduct an empirical study on the relationship between difficulties and practices of ISRM in ICT Outsourcing. Questionnaires were distributed to 300 private companies from various industry and government agencies in Malaysia for the study. Findings of the study show that difficulty of ISRM process influences its practices in ICT outsourcing. Through the findings, influence strength between difficulties and practices of information security risk management approach in ICT outsourcing project has been discovered. Risk treatment planning task was considered as the most difficult and risk control task was considered the least difficult in ISRM cycle. However most of the organization plans their risk treatment task since an appropriate plan could ensure more effective information security risk management implementation. In conclusion, difficulties of organization current (ISRM) practices for ICT Outsourcing shows that their current practices required for review and improvement appropriately for ICT outsourcing implementation. Hence, it's would encourage development of more comprehensible and effective approach managing information security risk for ICT outsourcing project. © 2010 IEEE.","","Network protocols; Outsourcing; Privatization; Risk analysis; Risk management; Surveys; Business environments; Current practices; Empirical studies; Government agencies; ICT services; Information communication technology; Information security; Malaysia; Manage information; Organizational information; Outsource; Outsourcing projects; Private companies; Risk controls; Risk treatment; Security of data"

This could assist in narrowing the evident ""information security gap"" that currently exists in undergraduate information technology/information systems/computer science (IT/IS/CS) curricula at South African universities. Design/methodology/ approach: This paper briefly reviews existing literature relating to outcomes-based education in South Africa with a specific focus on CCFOs. A literature review was also carried out to determine existing approaches to education in information security. A survey was carried out to establish the extent to which information security is currently incorporated into the IT/IS/CS curricula at South African universities and a discussion group was used to provide insight into the current situation at undergraduate level. Findings: Education in information security has matured much more rapidly in postgraduate than in undergraduate programmes at South African universities. In addition, the extent to which information security is addressed at undergraduate level is on an ad hoc basis, with isolated attention being paid to a few information security aspects. An integrated approach to information security education is therefore proposed by considering information security as a CCFO. Research limitations/implications: Further research is required to determine how appropriate information security aspects can be seamlessly integrated into the various learning programmes at undergraduate level. Practical implications: The proposed integrated approach to information security education will require that IT/IS/CS educators develop strategies to incorporate relevant information security aspects into their learning programmes. Originality/value: This paper proposes an integrated approach to information security education by considering information security as a CCFO. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Curricula; Data security; Information science; South Africa; Universities","Curricula; Information science; Integrated control; Societies and institutions; Stress intensity factors; Current situation; Data security; Information security; Information security education; Integrated approach; Literature reviews; South Africa; Undergraduate programmes; Universities; Security of data"

It is often impractical for these policies to be enforced directly, and users frequently have incentives not to comply. In both realistic and simplified situations the resulting principal-agent problem can be extremely complicated. Consequently, managers often have to make decisions about security policy in the face of a high degree of uncertainty, both about user behaviour and the ambient threat environment. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to some of the complexities using a variety of types of model, and to suggest ways in which progress towards practical, model-based decision processes might be made. No single model - Or type of model - Is likely to provide complete insight into the problem. First to be considered is a decision-making process using calculation of utility, and based on inferences about population behaviour derived from empirical data. The issues surrounding a practical methodology featuring simulation are discussed. The use of game theory is considered as a way of understanding the interaction between an organization and its users. It is further proposed that methods from statistical mechanics can be used to provide models of interaction and influence within the user community - These suggest that extreme non-linearities may be present in the behaviour of the community.

Using available licensing programs from major publishers can be difficult because of the contractual commitments and often misunderstood complexities of those programs. Each publisher has its own licensing criteria for obtaining products. Product support must be considered when acquiring any title for campus-wide use. Educational institutions will often embrace ""open source"" software to overcome these obstacles. While that is a possible solution, commercial software products are often a better choice. West Virginia University embarked upon a centralized approach for widely used commercial software in 2002. The program has evolved to providing products from several publishers. The campus-wide distribution of software uses a combination of cost recovery and centralized funding. Students and employees can purchase products at significant savings for personal use. Institutional users can easily obtain the tools to prepare their course material and share those same tools with their students. Software licensing involves several entities within the institution such as the legal department, procurement, network administration, customer support, academic affairs, student affairs, information security, and information technology.

Similarly by applying a reverse method to the cover file, we show how easily the secret message can be recovered by the intended receiver. © 2010 IEEE.","Feature coding; Information hiding; Information security; Text steganography","Feature codes; Feature coding; Indian languages; Information hiding; Information security; New approaches; Secret messages; Text steganography; Steganography"

Design/methodology/approach: Setting potential problems based on Hofstede's scores of cultural dimensions and the authors' experience, this paper predicts potential problems first by using the theory of level of potential. Local employees working for foreign companies were polled to evaluate the severity of the problems. Based on the survey results, the paper finds which problems may take place, what triggers them and how severe they are. Finally, it finds countermeasures to prevent the problems. Findings: Overall, British, US and Japanese companies are found to have higher potential of facing problems in the EAC. The problem of ""using a previous company's confidential information"" has been found to have the highest severity. British, US and Belgian companies have individualism-originated problems. Japanese companies have the highest potential of facing problems due to masculinity. Chinese companies have the highest potential of facing problems due to long-term orientation. In addition, a list of countermeasures is proposed to protect business information. Originality/value: The paper has identified information security management (ISM)-related problems with their severities for each of the selected investing countries in the EAC, applying a new method to predict potential problems concerning ISM in foreign companies. It has recommended practical countermeasures against the six serious problems identified. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cross-cultural studies; Data security; East Africa; Information management; International organizations","Facings; Industry; Information management; International cooperation; Social sciences; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Business information; Chinese companies; Confidential information; Cross-cultural study; Cultural difference; Cultural dimensions; Cultural environment; Data security; Design/methodology/approach; East Africa; East africans; Foreign companies; Information security; Information security managements; Information security policies; International organizations; Japanese company; Long-term orientation; Potential problems; Security of data"

The current works that aim to integrate two or more security services are usually focused on a particular implementation strategy, because the systematic approach to integrated security systems requires the analysis of relations between security data. In our work was proposed and developed a Security Services Integrated Layer (SSIL), consisting of an organization pattern of information security, as well as behavioral models to analyze the occurrence of abnormality identified. The Hidden Markov Model and the proposed solutions as subHMM and Sequential Model allowed the integration of security services based on behavior. In this article we highlight the rates of detection of anomalies and a critical analysis of results. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","anomalies detection; behavior models; Hidden Markov Model","Network security; anomalies detection; Behavior model; Behavioral model; Critical analysis; Implementation strategies; Information security; Integrated security systems; Integration of security; Performance issues; Security services; Sequential model; Hidden Markov models"

This paper presents a hybrid approach based on the Adaptive Intelligent Intrusion Detector Agent (AIIDA-SQL) for the detection of those attacks. The AIIDA-SQL agent incorporates a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) engine which is equipped with learning and adaptation capabilities for the classification of SQL queries and detection of malicious user requests. To carry out the tasks of attack classification and detection, the agent incorporates advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages. Concretely, an innovative classification model based on a mixture of an Artificial Neuronal Network together with a Support Vector Machine is applied in the reuse stage of the CBR cycle. This strategy enables to classify the received SQL queries in a reliable way. Finally, a projection neural technique is incorporated, which notably eases the revision stage carried out by human experts in the case of suspicious queries. The experimental results obtained on a real-traffic case study show that AIIDA-SQL performs remarkably well in practice. © 2010 IEEE.","Agent; Artificial neural network; Case-based reasoning; Intrusion detection; SQL injection; Support vector machine","Computer crime; Detectors; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Network security; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Artificial Neural Network; Artificial neuronal network; CBr; Classification models; Human expert; Hybrid approach; Information security; Intrusion detectors; Learning and adaptation; Neural techniques; SQL injection; SQL query; WEB application; Case based reasoning"

Unfortunately, universities have the added challenge of not only managing administrative and academic sensitive information, but often times the personal sensitive information of students and employees. This study reflects on the current best practices in managing sensitive information and discusses how Youngstown State University implements controls for sensitive information. According to the United States Federal Trade Commission, not only is managing sensitive information a good practice, but most industries are mandated by local and state regulations, as well as federal statutes such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Universities like many commercial organizations which handle credit card transactions must comply with the Payment Card Industry's Data Security Standard. With the unique requirements of each regulation, it is often difficult to address each adequately. This study provides a framework for approaching the management of professional and personal sensitive information given the unique requirements faced by higher education. © 2010 ACM.","Data loss prevention; Data management; Data privacy; Data security; Information management; Information privacy; Information security; Records management; Records retention; Risk management; Sensitive information handling","Data handling; Education; Information management; Laws and legislation; Leaching; Loss prevention; Records management; Risk analysis; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Data loss prevention; Data management; Data security; Information privacy; Information security; Records retention; Sensitive informations; Data privacy"

With the other Steganography methods such as Image, Audio, Video, a number of text Steganography algorithms have been introduced. This paper presents a new linguistic approach for Steganography through Indian Languages by considering the flexible grammar structure of Indian Languages. To add more security to the system, instead of hiding the original message it is converted to an irrelevant binary stream by comparing the message bits with the pixel values of an Image. Thereafter, the bits of this binary stream are encoded to some part-of-speech and by creating meaningful sentences starting with a suitable word belonging to the mapped part-of-speech, the proposed method hides the message inside a cover file containing some innocuous sentences. Similarly in receiving side, the algorithm finds the corresponding part-of-speech of the starting word of each sentence and place the bit stream of the mapped part-of-speech to recover the converted message. After comparing these bits with the Image pixels, the algorithm extracted the original message from the cover file. The proposed method exhibits satisfactory result on some Indian Languages like Bengali. © 2010 IEEE.","Information hiding; Information security; Linguistic text steganography; Text steganography; Text watermarking","Algorithms; Hydraulics; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Pixels; Art and science; Binary streams; Bit stream; Image pixels; Indian languages; Information hiding; Information security; Linguistic approach; Part Of Speech; Pixel values; Text steganography; Text watermarking; Steganography"
