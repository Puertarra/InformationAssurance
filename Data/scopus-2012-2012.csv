The integration of information security in e-government is no longer an option, but an imperative given the resulting ""information overload"" and the need to filter ""good"" from ""bad"" information. Unless South Africa integrates information security in its e-government development policy and practices, the acclaimed benefits of e-government will not be realized. The moral hazard problems arising from bad information behavior such as human manipulation, withholding information, unauthorized access, and violation of individual privacy and confidentiality heightens the need to combat info-security risks and vulnerabilities. South Africa's readiness to deal with the information security risks has come under scrutiny. The information security infrastructure in South Africa is also not clearly understood. This chapter examines South Africa's information security landscape and describes how institutional and agency coordination could help improve information security in e-government. © 2013, IGI Global.","",""

In MLS, documents are assigned to a security label by a trusted subject e.g. an authorized user and based on this assignment; the access to documents is allowed or denied. Using a large number of security labels lead to a complex administration in MLS based operating systems. This is because the manual assignment of documents to a large number of security labels by an authorized user is time-consuming and error-prone. Thus in practice, most MLS based operating systems use a small number of security labels. However, information that is normally processed in an organization consists of different sensitivities and belongs to different compartments. To depict this information in MLS, a large number of security labels is necessary. The aim of this paper is to show that the use of latent semantic indexing is successful in assigning textual information to security labels. This supports the authorized user by his manual assignment. It reduces complexity by the administration of a MLS based operating system and it enables the use of a large number of security labels. In future, the findings probably will lead to an increased usage of these MLS based operating systems in organizations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

There is scope for research on the factors that influence user behaviour and attitudes toward this aspect of information security and their impact on organisation's network integrity. This research aims to study the critical success factors (CSF) for employees in order to comply with the organisational information security policy with a view to mitigating security breaches. Information security can be managed through three separate mechanisms: organisational factors, behavioural factors and training. Each of these elements impact differently on information security and comprehensive solutions include combinations of all three. The findings provide empirically evaluated information regarding the obstacles and the effective factors in employees' compliance with the implementation of the information security policy. The identified categories of factors are followed differently by employees working in Health, Business and Education. Questionnaire analysis as part of this study suggests that employees in the health sector comply the most in adhering with information security policy as compared to other sectors. One of the reasons for this is that health sector employees have better awareness, robust communication and effective training programmes with reinforcement and satisfaction. Moreover, employees in the health sector believe in the norms of security policies and have a positive attitude, as they recognise the significance of security policies, unlike the business and education sectors. © 2012 IEEE.","awareness; compliance; Information security; quantitative research; security behaviour; training and awareness programme","Behavioral research; Embedded software; Health; Personnel training; Research; Security of data; Security systems; awareness; compliance; Critical success factor; Education sectors; Global technology; Information security managements; Information security policies; Network integrity; Organisational factors; Positive attitude; Quantitative research; Robust communication; security behaviour; Security breaches; Security policy; Training programmes; User behaviour; Information technology"

As it is important to understand students' behaviors towards information security and safety in the digital cyberspace, the purpose of this paper is to investigate their awareness and perception, in particular, of Bluetooth security threats and risks, and whether they are able to take preventive measures to protect themselves from such security vulnerabilities. Bluetooth technology is used in this study as it is a widely used form of wireless networks that facilitates computing resources to be connected anytime anywhere; however, it has security weaknesses like any other digital networks. Design/methodology/approach - A field survey was conducted to collect the empirical data from students at a local university. The survey instrument/questionnaire was developed based on various literatures on Bluetooth applications, Bluetooth security vulnerabilities, and users' usage and perception on computer security and safety. Findings - The results show that most students do not take precautions to mitigate against security vulnerabilities; however, there is a difference on students' perceptions based on their academic major or domain knowledge, for instance, engineering students have demonstrated significant awareness of security risks compared to students from the business and social science colleges. It is therefore not surprising to note that engineering students are more cautious users of Bluetooth, hence are more secure users of technologies. Practical implications - The findings provide useful information for academic institutions to understand students' behavior towards security risks especially in terms of identity theft, unsecured systems and inadequate security practices. Indeed, the findings of this study highlight or emphasize the importance of promoting security awareness to student cohorts especially on the use of mobile computing applications such as Bluetooth or wireless. Perhaps, universities should design curriculum to incorporate the study of information and cyber security so as to inculcate a culture of cyber safety as well as to prepare these prospective employees as more secured users when they enter the workplace. Indeed, considering the increasing number of users who tend to be naïve on security vulnerabilities, this research adds a critical message also to manufacturers and software developers to design more robust security features so as to minimize security breaches. Originality/value - This paper provides further evidence to the body of research investigations on information and computing security threats and students' perceptions and behavior towards security risks and vulnerabilities. More important, this paper confirms that most students are not secure users, and it seems they not very capable of protecting themselves from security threats. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer networks; Computer security; Computer users; Information security; Information technology; Internet; Internet security; Students","Bluetooth; Computer networks; Curricula; Engineering research; Information technology; Internet; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Security systems; Students; Surveys; Academic institutions; Bluetooth application; Bluetooth technology; Computer users; Computing applications; Computing resource; Computing security; Cyber security; Cyber-safety; Cyberspaces; Design curricula; Design/methodology/approach; Digital networks; Domain knowledge; Empirical data; Field surveys; Identity theft; Internet security; Preventive measures; Robust security; Security awareness; Security breaches; Security Practice; Security risks; Security threats; Security vulnerabilities; Security weakness; Software developer; Survey instruments; Security of data"

While originating in criminal behavior, their impact are also influenced by the decisions of legitimate end users. Getting agents in the Internet, and in networks in general, to invest in and deploy security features and protocols is a challenge, in particular because of economic reasons arising from the presence of network externalities. In this paper, we focus on the question of incentive alignment for agents of a large network towards a better security. We start with an economic model for a single agent, that determines the optimal amount to invest in protection. The model takes into account the vulnerability of the agent to a security breach and the potential loss if a security breach occurs. We derive conditions on the quality of the protection to ensure that the optimal amount spent on security is an increasing function of the agent's vulnerability and potential loss. We also show that for a large class of risks, only a small fraction of the expected loss should be invested. Building on these results, we study a network of interconnected agents subject to epidemic risks. We derive conditions to ensure that the incentives of all agents are aligned towards a better security. When agents are strategic, we show that security investments are always socially inefficient due to the network externalities. Moreover alignment of incentives typically implies a coordination problem, leading to an equilibrium with a very high price of anarchy. © 2012 IEEE.","Economics of Information Security; Game Theory; Incentives; Network Effects; Optimal Security Investment","Alignment; Economics; Game theory; Internet protocols; Optimization; Security systems; A-monotone; Coordination problems; Economic models; Economics of information; End users; Expected loss; High price; Incentive alignment; Incentives; Increasing functions; Large networks; Malicious software; Malwares; Network effects; Network externality; Optimal security; Potential loss; Security breaches; Security features; Security investments; Security threats; Single-agent; Network security"

The special nature and the constraints posed by wireless ad hoc networks make the establishment of a group key a challenging task. The execution of a group key distribution scheme must be very carefully designed having in mind both the computation and communication efficiency. In this paper, we propose a communication efficient group key distribution scheme which adopts the Identity Based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) methodology. No message exchange is required for the suggested scheme to establish a group key when the group members' identities are known to the broadcaster. A highlight of the scheme is that communication overhead remains unchanged as group size grows. In order for the group member to obtain his/her session key, only one bilinear pairing computation is required. Moreover, we show that the new scheme is proved secure in standard model under the truncated q-ABDHE assumption. Thus, the scheme can not only meet security demands but also efficient in terms of computational and communication.

Steganography in Digital media becomes a challenging discipline, since the Human Auditory System (HAS) is highly sensitive. One of the main obstacles of the number of files hiding in Digital media is to develop a system which has the quality to include number of files and without affectively the Digital media and provides Statistical steganalysis schemes detect the existence of secret information embedded by steganography. The detection and regular singular (RS) attack methods are two well known statistical stegnalysis schemes used against LSB. The embedded message length can be estimated accurately by these two steganalysis schemes. For secret communication, the resistance of steganography against steganalysis is very important for information security. To avoid enemy's attempts, the statistical features between stego-media and cover-media should be as similar as possible for better resistance to steganalysis. In this paper we propose a reversible histogram transformation function based LSB steganographic method to resist statistical steganalysis. The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data and the embedded data should be as imperceptible as possible. The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations. Thus it is necessary that the hidden message should be encrypted. Steganograph is an application of Digital media(Image, Audio, Video) steganography. It hides data in digital media files.

In information security, a policy will take the form of an access control policy that describes the conditions under which entities can perform actions on data objects. Further, such policies are prolific in modern society, where information must flow between different enterprises, states, and countries, all of which will likely have different policies. Unfortunately, policies have proven to be extremely difficult to evaluate. Even with formal policies, basic questions about policy completeness and consistency can be undecidable. These problems are confounded when multiple policies must be considered in aggregation. Even worse, many policies are merely ""formal-looking"" or are completely informal. Thus, they cannot be reasoned about in a formal way and it may not even be possible to reliably determine whether a given course of action is allowed. Even with all of these problems, policies face issues related to their validity. That is, to be valid, a policy should reflect the intent of the policy makers and it should be clear what the consequences are if a policy is violated. It is the contention of the authors that when evaluating policies, one needs to be able to understand and reason about the policy maker's intentions and the consequences associated with them. This paper focuses on the intent portion of this perspective. Unfortunately, because policy makers are humans, policy maker intentions are not readily captured by existing policy languages and notations. To rectify this, we take inspiration from task analytic methods, a set of tools and techniques human factors engineers and cognitive scientists use to represent and reason about the intentions behind human behavior. Using task analytic models as a template, we describe how policies can be represented in task-like models as hierarchies of goals and rules, with logics specifying when goals are contextually relevant and what outcomes are expected when goals are achieved. We then discuss how this framing could be used to reason about policy maker intent when evaluating policies. We further outline how this approach could be extended to facilitate reasoning about consequences. Support for legacy systems is also explored. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Access control; Complex systems; Firewalls; Intent; Policies","Access control; Computer system firewalls; Information systems; Large scale systems; Legacy systems; Public policy; Access control policies; Analytic method; Analytic models; Course of action; Data objects; Human behaviors; Intent; Policy language; Policy makers; Tools and techniques; Decision making"

The success of a side-channel attack depends on the crypto-algorithm implementation, the platform being attacked, and the attack strategy. While the former two parameters are generally beyond the adversary's control, the choice of the attack strategy is solely with the adversary. However, there is no unique best attack strategy. The attack strategy that works best for one platform may not be the best for another. Further there is no systematic way to choose the best attack strategy from the available pool. In this paper, we analyze a category of side-channel attacks known as profiled cache-timing attacks and develop a methodology by which an adversary capable of limited number of side-channel measurements can choose the best strategy prior to the actual attack. The methodology is tested on several platforms and cipher implementations and shows that the best attacking strategy can be estimated closely, without the requirement of an exhaustive search. © 2012 IEEE.","Attack strategy; formal analysis; profiled cache-timing attacks; side-channel attacks; success rates","Computer networks; Safety engineering; Attack strategies; Formal analysis; profiled cache-timing attacks; Side channel attack; success rates; Security of data"

But does education decrease security incidents of being a victim and increase preventive actions? Nothing was found in the literature that shows education will lower the number of security incidents of being a victim. The purpose of this paper is to determine if security incidents can be lowered by education. Findings showed that education does increase preventative behavior and is unrelated to the number of security incidents. An interesting find was the more preventative behavior, the more security incidents occurred. The discussion section explores the possible whys.

Cryptanalysis of the double random phase encryption (DRPE) scheme provides an insight into its weaknesses, and reasons due to which different types of attacks are able to breach the security of the scheme. Some strategies to circumvent the problems related to the vulnerabilities of the DRPE schemes have been described with an emphasis on making the scheme impulse attack-free. A succinct survey of the iterative algorithm based encryption schemes brings into focus the fact that these schemes are slow due the iterative nature of phase masks generation. Removal of an inherent silhouette problem in the analytically generated phase-only masks with jigsaw transformation has been discussed. A simple alternative method for the optical implementation using a single spatial light modulator has also been implemented. A brief discussion of the holographic security systems has been presented, and enhancement in the security by use of convergent random illumination has been discussed.","Double random phase encryption; Fractional fourier transform; Holographic security systems; Optical cryptanalysis; Optical information security",""

Currently, only a small number of educational programs are funded and equipped to educate cybersecurity professionals and those few programs cannot train a workforce of thousands in a relatively short period of time. Moreover, not only are additional educational resources needed, but the programs need to deliver high quality, hands-on learning for future cybersecurity professionals. Survey results show that lack of funding and lack of equipment prevent some educational institutions from providing a hands-on learning component in security curricula. One solution is the use of remote labs to increase the number of students with access to security lab environments. We propose that it is an appropriate time for Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance and other organizations to collaborate to assist universities, community colleges and even high schools, through the development of remote security labs, to increase our nation's capacity to adequately train a large number of cybersecurity professionals.

Most Internet users are associated with at least one popular SNS depending on their personal and professional preferences. Users have, in general, trusted the SNSs with personal data, and assumed that their privacy preferences are correctly enforced. Users of SNSs often want to manage the sharing of information and content with different groups of people based on their differing relationships. Configuring settings for each user is a great burden for a user, and most of the time, settings are not evident to users, and hence some automatic or semi-automatic mechanism should be available to reduce the privacy configuration efforts. Increasing user-driven contribution has also led to other kinds of problems, like spam and abusive message contents. The authors refer both of these types as social spam, which not only consumes extra resources of site, but also spoils the user experience and creates legal issues. In large scale SNS, human moderation becomes out of hand, and there is a need for machine intelligence to get rid of such spammers in an effective way. In social networks, users' actions, contributions, demographic details, et cetera can be tracked, and necessary measures can be taken if unwanted behavior about a particular user is detected. One can make a user model of reputation to identify troublesome users and ban their activities temporarily or permanently whenever needed. User reputation systems help to improve the user experience of a site, enrich content quality, and provide incentives for users to become better, more active participants. In this chapter, authors describe issues related to privacy, social spamming, and show the measures to handle them by nearly automatic ways. The chapter also shows the making of a user reputation system and its applicability in social network. © 2012, IGI Global.","",""

Cryptography and Steganography are two popular techniques which are to be used for effective secret communications. In this paper, we propose a new encoding scheme to covert the secret text into cipher text. The proposed encoding scheme treats every 16 message characters as a single unit where each character is encoded in 7 bit binary and then it coverts each unit to 14 ASCII characters of length 8 bits. This encoding scheme converts the message block into cipher text. Hash code is calculated on the original message at the transmission side. Sender generates 3 different keys from the calculated hash code. Key 1 tracks the original position of alphabets and digits alternatively. Key 2 can be obtained by separating the first 10 alphabets retrieved from hash code and add the remaining alphabets at the end of separated digits. Key 3 is the reverse of key 2. Now hide the separated 10 alphabets from hash code (in generating key 2) in an image using least significant bit steganography. Cipher text, stego image and the two keys are transmitted to the end user. Upon receiving the data receiver applies the reverse procedure and can check the authenticity of the document. The proposed method is very efficient in generating cipher text and also in verifying the authenticity of the message. Instead of simply transmitting the hash code, the proposed methods protects the cryptographic checksum value in two different keys and in a stego image.

While revisions to most of those laws have been proposed over the past few years, no major cybersecurity legislation has been enacted since 2002. Recent legislative proposals, including many bills introduced in the 111th and 112th Congresses, have focused largely on issues in 10 broad areas (see ""Selected Issues Addressed in Proposed Legislation"" for an overview of how current legislative proposals would address issues in several of those areas): • national strategy and the role of government, • reform of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), • protection of critical infrastructure (including the electricity grid and the chemical industry), • information sharing and cross-sector coordination, • breaches resulting in theft or exposure of personal data such as financial information, • cybercrime, • privacy in the context of electronic commerce, • international efforts, • research and development, and • the cybersecurity workforce. For most of those topics, at least some of the bills addressing them have proposed changes to current laws. Several of the bills specifically focused on cybersecurity have received committee or floor action, but none have become law. Comprehensive legislative proposals on cybersecurity that have received considerable attention in 2012 are S. 2105, recommendations from a House Republican task force, and a proposal by the Obama Administration. They differ in approach, with S. 2105 proposing the most extensive regulatory framework and organizational changes of the three, and the task force recommendations focusing more on incentives for improving private-sector cybersecurity. An alternative to S. 2105, S. 3342 (a refinement of S. 2151), does not include enhanced regulatory authority or new federal entities, but does include cybercrime provisions. Several narrower House bills have been introduced that address some of the issues raised and recommendations made by the House task force. Four passed the House the week of April 23: • Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2011 (H.R. 2096), which addresses federal cybersecurity R&D and the development of technical standards; • Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (H.R. 3523), which focuses on information sharing and coordination, including sharing of classified information; • Advancing America's Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Act of 2012 (H.R. 3834), which addresses R&D in networking and information technology, including but not limited to security; and • Federal Information Security Amendments Act of 2012 (H.R. 4257), which addresses FISMA reform. One was ordered reported out of the full committee but did not come to the floor: • Promoting and Enhancing Cybersecurity and Information Sharing Effectiveness Act of 2011 or PRECISE Act of 2011 (H.R. 3674), which addresses the role of the Department of Homeland Security in cybersecurity, including protection of federal systems, personnel, R&D, information sharing, and public/private sector collaboration in protecting critical infrastructure; Together, those House and Senate bills address most of the issues listed above, although in different ways. All include proposed revisions to some existing laws covered in this report. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

The authors address the unsubstantiated claim that there is an important relationship between OC and the ability to successfully implement information security. Findings suggest that security practices can be successfully implemented within eight organizational culture characteristics. Investigation of these organizational culture characteristics from a security perspective is an important step toward future empirical research aimed at understanding the relationship between OC and the implementation of systematic improvement of security practices.

Here, the decision makers, as members of the surveillance community of practice, may be confronted with rapidly changing information, and the solution or solutions may be required rapidly at a low cost. In these cases, fully automated monitoring or surveillance systems are limited in their utility because of dynamic contexts and temporal and spatial variations. Managing these limitations typically requires human judgement to assess the results of these monitoring systems. Other reasons for requiring human judgement include a need for the surveillance results to be verified and assured with substantiating evidence, and the delegation of control and responsibility when actioning remedial responses to generated alerts and alarms. Surveillance Information Systems performance depends on reducing the decision time for remedial action by verifying alarms and generating actionable indicators, in context.

The two professions of Records Management (RM) and Digital Forensics (DF) can offer insights into how this might be achieved. In this chapter, the authors seek to explore the relationship between the two disciplines and the areas where collaboration and interdisciplinary work would be most beneficial. An initial overview of RM and its relationship to the wider field of Information Assurance (IA) precedes a more in depth comparison of the two related disciplines, using a model that integrates RM and DF. This is offered as a conceptual framework for making decisions about how to identify and manage the increasing quantities of evidence collected on networks. Organizational Network Forensic Readiness (NFR) has emerged as a method for supporting collection of digital evidence from networks using suggested checklists, procedures, and tools. This chapter elaborates upon a previously documented life cycle methodology for 'operationalizing' organizational NFR and integrates this with best practice from RM in FRC. FRC provides a conceptual approach to proactive evidence collection and identifies the phases at which RM approaches and processes might be most effectively employed in the Cloud. © 2013, IGI Global.","",""

In conventional frameworks for SAML, a Service Provider (SP) has to log the usage history of users by an pseudonymous ID (including attributes), thus only an Identity Provider (IdP) can analyze this SP' s usage logs. If the IdP can look usage logs, it can touch user' s privacy information. We define such flow of information as ""backflow"" . We propose a secure countermeasure protocol against the backflow between the IdP and the SP by using a new ID, named ""hashedID"". In our new approach, the IdP cannot analyze the usage logs by using an Attribute Provider (AP) as an Identifier Transformer (IdT). The IdT can secure transform from an ID that the IdP issued to hashedID. This approach enables the use of more secure SAML communication without sharing personal information that the user doesn't want the IdP to know about.

Discounting large numbers of these false-positive data flow paths wastes an information security evaluator's time and effort. Here we show how to automatically eliminate some false-positive data flow paths by precisely modelling how classified data is blocked by certain expressions in embedded C code. We present a library of detailed data flow models of individual expression elements and an algorithm for introducing these components into conventional data flow graphs. The resulting models can be used to accurately trace byte-level or even bit-level data flow through expressions that are normally treated as atomic. This allows us to identify expressions that safely downgrade their classified inputs and thereby eliminate false-positive data flow paths from the security evaluation process. To validate the approach we have implemented and tested it in an existing data flow analysis toolkit. © 2012, Australian Computer Society, Inc.","Data flow analysis; Downgrading; Embedded programs; Security-critical software; Taint analysis","Data flow graphs; Data transfer; Network security; Analysis techniques; C codes; Data confidentiality; Data flow; Dataflow model; Downgrading; Program code; Runtimes; Security evaluation; Taint analysis; Data flow analysis"

This reliance on ERP indicates the importance of studying security issues and requirements in an ERP Environment.

Forty-six states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have laws requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information. Federal statutes, regulations, and a memorandum for federal departments and agencies require certain sectors (healthcare, financial, federal public sector, and the Department of Veterans Affairs) to implement information security programs and provide notification of security breaches of personal information. In response to such notification laws, over 2,676 data breaches and computer intrusions involving 535 million records containing sensitive personal information have been disclosed by data brokers, businesses, retailers, educational institutions, government and military agencies, healthcare providers, financial institutions, nonprofit organizations, utility companies, and Internet businesses. As a result, a significantly large number of individuals have received notices that their personally identifiable information has been improperly disclosed. This chapter provides an overview of state security breach notification laws applicable to entities that collect, maintain, own, possess, or license personal information. The chapter describes information security and security breach notification requirements in the Office of Management and Budget's ""Breach Notification Policy,"" the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). The Senate Judiciary Committee marked up three data security bills and reported the three bills with substitute amendments. See Selected Federal Data Security Breach Legislation, by Kathleen Ann Ruane. S. 1151 (Leahy), the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2011, would apply to business entities to prevent and mitigate identity theft, ensure privacy, provide notice of security breaches, and enhance criminal penalties. It would provide law enforcement assistance and other protections against security breaches, fraudulent access, and misuse of personally identifiable information. S. 1408 (Feinstein), the Data Breach Notification Act of 2011, would require federal agencies and persons engaged in interstate commerce, in possession of data containing sensitive personally identifiable information, to disclose any breach of such information. S. 1535 (Blumenthal), the Personal Data Protection and Breach Accountability Act of 2011, would protect consumers by mitigating the vulnerability of personally identifiable information to theft through a security breach, provide notice and remedies to consumers, hold companies accountable for preventable breaches, facilitate the sharing of post-breach technical information, and enhance criminal and civil penalties and other protections against the unauthorized collection or use of personally identifiable information. The House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade marked up H.R. 2577 (Bono Mack), the SAFE Data Act, to protect consumers by requiring reasonable security policies and procedures to protect data containing personal information, and to provide for nationwide notice in the event of a security breach. Several subcommittee Democrats objected to the bill's definition of personal information, arguing that the description is limited and does not adequately protect consumers from identity theft. The House Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade Subcommittee approved H.R. 2577 by voice vote and the measure was referred to the full committee for consideration. H.R. 1707 (Rush) and H.R. 1841 (Stearns) were also introduced to protect consumers by requiring reasonable security policies and procedures to protect computerized data containing personal information and providing for nationwide notice in the event of a breach.

However, this type of companies requires ISMSs which have been adapted to their specific characteristics, and these systems must be optimized from the point of view of the resources necessary to deploy and maintain them. Over the last 10 years, the authors have obtained considerable experience in the establishment of ISMSs, and during this time, they have observed that the structure and characteristics of SMEs as regards security management are frequently very similar (since they can all be grouped by business size and sector), thus signifying that it is possible to construct patterns for ISMSs that can be reused and refined. In this chapter, the authors present the strategy that they have designed to manage and reuse security information in information system security management. This strategy is framed within a methodology designed for integral security management and its informa-tion systems maturity, denominated as ""Methodology for Security Management and Maturity in Small and Medium-size Enterprises (MSM2-SME),"" and it is defined in a reusable model called ""Reusable Pattern for Security Management (RPSM),"" which systematically defines, manages, and reuses the aforementioned methodology through a sub-process denominated as ""Generation of Security Management Patterns (GSMP).""

However, most of these activities focus on specific issues, which cannot mitigate negative effects as a whole. In this paper, we first introduce a common architecture of smartphones including main smartphone assets. Then we identify smartphone threats which are clustered into vulnerabilities and attacks.

Traditional security methods such as personal identification number, password, and key smart cards are proving to be more and more inadequate, especially in large-scale authentication systems. Hence today, the biometric-based security system is gaining acceptance as an effective tool for providing information security, as can be seen by its deployment in various commercial, public, border control and governmental applications. Each biometric technique has its own merits, but recently, finger-vein biometrics has shown great promise with some key advantages over the other biometrics, which include fingerprint, face, iris and voice. Research has shown that finger-vein biometrics yield very low error equal rates (EER). However, there is more room for improvement. This paper presents a method to optimize finger-vein detection by using genetic algorithms (GA) to fine-tune the image processing parameters in an finger-vein biometric FPGA-based system-on-chip embedded system. The parameters that are tunable include threshold levels and filtering parameters. Experimental results show that the optimization process can successfully reduce the EER from 1.004% to 0.101% on the same biometric system, negating the need for an expert system designer intuition on the image processing parameters. © 2012 IEEE.","embedded system; Finger-vein biometrics; genetic algorithms; image processing; system optimization","Application specific integrated circuits; Authentication; Communication systems; Embedded systems; Expert systems; Genetic algorithms; Image processing; Optimization; Security of data; Security systems; Smart cards; Authentication systems; Biometric systems; Biometric techniques; Border control; Effective tool; Finger-vein; Networking and communication; Optimization process; Parameter-tuning; Personal identification number; Processing parameters; Security methods; System designers; System on chips; System optimizations; Technology advancement; Threshold levels; User authentication; Biometrics"

They have brought us great convenience, yet at the same time, information security problems have also come into being. Some of access authentication schemes on removable storage media have been proposed as means to determine device trust. This paper analyzes the security risks of these schemes and proposes a novel approach, which takes into account both the users and the physical properties of the media so as to bind the user and removable storage media. Then only a legitimate user with a valid removable storage media can obtain certification and access the trusted system. The correctness and security analysis of this scheme are analyzed. This study also presents the implementation of the proposed scheme and gives the experimental results to show its high efficiency. © 2012 by Binary Information Press.","Access authentication; Digital signature; Information security; Removable storage media","Authentication; Electronic document identification systems; Network security; Security of data; Access authentications; Legitimate users; Security analysis; Security risks; Storage media; Trusted systems; Digital storage"

E-business has been established mainly on the platform of Internet system. With the evolution of electronic technologies, a faster e-transaction has been made possible by the Internet. It has been noticed that Internet fraud or e-business fraud is increasing with the increase of e-transaction. A few sorts of card (debit or credit) fraud are decreasing by the banks and the government providing detection and prevention systems. But Card-not-Present fraud losses are increasing at higher rate. In online transactions, it is obvious that there is no chance to use Chip and Pin, and also no chance to use card face-to-face. Card-not-Present fraud losses are growing in an unprotected and undetected way. This chapter seeks to investigate the current debate regarding the credit fraud and vulnerabilities in online banking and to study some possible remedial actions to detect and prevent credit fraud. A comprehensive study of online banking and e-business has been undertaken with a special focus on credit fraud detection. This research reveals a lot of channels of credit fraud that are increasing day by day.

In this chapter, the authors first introduce a query based learning concept (learning with query) in which all the minds' beliefs and actions will be revised by observing the outcomes of past mutual interactions (selective-attention and self-regulation) over time. That is, moving into an active learning and aggressive querying method will be able to focus on effectiveness to achieve learning goals and desired outcomes. Secondly, they show that the proposed method has better effectiveness for several learning algorithms, such as decision tree, particle swarm optimization, and self-organizing maps. Finally, a query based learning method is proposed to solve network security problems as a sample filter at intrusion detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only increase the accuracy detection rate for suspicious activity and recognize rare attack types but also significantly improve the efficiency of intrusion detection. Therefore, it is good to design and to implement an effective learning algorithm for information security. © 2012, IGI Global.","",""

This insight has gained traction in the political realm since the activities of Wikileaks, which hopes to attack 'unjust' systems or 'conspiracies'. Eventually, such threats to information security rely on a biologistic argument on the benefits and drawbacks that uncontrolled leaking might pose for 'just' and 'unjust' entities. Such biological metaphors are almost exclusively based on the economic advantage of participants. Here, I introduce a mathematical model of the complex dynamics implied by leaking. The complex interactions of adversaries are modeled by coupled logistic equations including network effects of econo-communication networks. The modeling shows, that there might arise situations where the leaking envisioned and encouraged by Wikileaks and the like can strengthen the defending entity (the 'conspiracy'). In particular, the only severe impact leaking can have on an organization seems to originate in the exploitation of leaks by another entity the organization competes with. Therefore, the model suggests that leaks can be used as a 'tactical mean' in direct adversary relations, but do not necessarily increase public benefit and societal immunization to 'conspiracies'. Furthermore, within the model the exploitation of the (open) competition between entities seems to be a more promising approach to control malicious organizations: divide-et-impera policies triumph here. © 2012 Kay Hamacher.","","Information Services; Models, Theoretical; Privacy; access to information; article; computer network; computer security; government regulation; information leakage; information processing; information system; mathematical computing; mathematical model; social structure; systems theory"

At the same time, individuals, subnational groups, and governments are using cyberspace to advance interests through malicious activity. Terrorist groups recruit, train, and target through the Internet, organized criminal enterprises exploit financial data with profits that exceed drug trafficking, and intelligence services steal secrets. Today individuals tend to pose the greatest danger in cyberspace, but nonstate actors, intelligence services, and militaries increasingly penetrate information technology networks for espionage and influence. This is likely to continue in the future as governments seek new ways and means to defend their interests in cyberspace and to develop their own offensive capabilities to compete in cyberspace. As an early example, the Obama administration released International Strategy for Cyberspace in May 2011, which defines four key characteristics of cyberspace: open to innovation, secure enough to earn people's trust, globally interoperable, and reliable.1 Ensuring reliability against threats seems to dominate national security discussions today and raises concerns when thinking about future warfare. Since the early 1990s analysts have forecast that cyberwar in the twenty-first century would be a salient feature of warfare. Yet, nearly twenty years later, individual hackers, intelligence services, and criminal groups pose the greatest danger in cyberspace, not militaries. But the concept of using cyber capabilities in war is slowly emerging. An example of this was the cyber attack that accompanied Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008. As Russian tanks and aircraft were entering Georgian territory, cyberwarriors attacked the Georgian Ministry of Defense. Though it had a minimal effect, the attack was a harbinger; future conflicts will have both a physical dimension and a virtual dimension. While not destructive, the attacks were disruptive. In the future, malicious code infiltrated through worms will disrupt communication systems, denial of service attacks will undermine governments' strategic messages, and logic bombs could turn out the lights in national capitals. This approach was discussed during the 2011 NATO campaign in Libya, but was left largely in the conceptual phases.2 As a preview of what is to come, the 2010 Stuxnet worm was the first worm specifically designed to attack industrial control systems.3 Had the worm not been detected, hackers could have obtained control of power plants, communication systems, and factories by hijacking the infected systems. Theoretically, this outside actor could manipulate a control system in a power plant to produce a catastrophic failure. The source of the worm is purely speculative, but some experts saw this as the first true cyber attack against Iran's nuclear infrastructure and credit it for slowing down Iran's program.4 The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review foreshadowed the dangers of Stuxnet and highlighted that, although it is a man-made domain, cyberspace is now as relevant a domain for Defense Department activities as the naturally occurring domains of land, sea, air, and space. The United States and many other countries, including China, Russia, Israel, and France, are preparing for conflict in the virtual dimension. In the United States, a joint cyber command was launched in 2010. With a modest two thousand personnel at its headquarters, the command derives support from fifty-four thousand sailors, eighteen thousand airmen, twenty-one thousand soldiers, and eight hundred marines who have been designated by their services to support the emerging cyber mission. The head of US Cyber Forces, Gen. Keith Alexander, sees future militaries using ""cyberspace (by operating within or through it) to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment with the intent of degrading, neutralizing, or destroying enemy combat capability, while protecting our own.""5 The 2011 National Military Strategy directed joint forces to ""secure the '.mil' domain, requiring a resilient DoD cyberspace architecture that employs a combination of detection, deterrence, denial, and multi-layered defense.""6 The Defense Department strategic initiatives for operating in cyberspace include the following: • Treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that the Defense Department can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential. • Employ new defense operating concepts to protect Department of Defense net-works and systems. • Partner with other US government departments and agencies and the private sector to enable a whole-of-government cybersecurity strategy. • Build robust relationships with US allies and international partners to strengthen collective cybersecurity. • Leverage the nation's ingenuity through an exceptional cyberworkforce and rapid technological innovation. 7 With this in mind, this book considers the current and future threats in cyberspace, discusses various approaches to advance and defend national interests in cyberspace, contrasts the US approach with European and Chinese views, and posits a way of using cyber capabilities in war. To be sure, the nature of and the role for cyberwar is still under debate.8 But this book establishes a coherent framework to understand how cyberspace fits within national security. © 2012 Georgetown University Press.

This chapter presents a semi-supervised text classification framework that is based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The framework integrates an Expectation Maximization (EM) process into a RBF network and can learn for classification effectively from a very small quantity of labeled training samples and a large pool of additional unlabeled documents.

Critical infrastructure commonly refers to those entities that are so vital that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national security, economic security, or the public health and safety. This report discusses selected legal issues that frequently arise in the context of recent legislation to address vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure to cyber threats, efforts to protect government networks from cyber threats, and proposals to facilitate and encourage sharing of cyber threat information among private sector and government entities. This report also discusses the degree to which federal law may preempt state law. It has been argued that, in order to ensure the continuity of critical infrastructure and the larger economy, a regulatory framework for selected critical infrastructure should be created to require a minimum level of security from cyber threats. On the other hand, others have argued that such regulatory schemes would not improve cybersecurity while increasing the costs to businesses, expose businesses to additional liability if they fail to meet the imposed cybersecurity standards, and increase the risk that proprietary or confidential business information may be inappropriately disclosed. In order to protect federal information networks, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in conjunction with the National Security Agency (NSA), uses a network intrusion system that monitors all federal agency networks for potential attacks. Known as EINSTEIN, this system raises significant privacy implications-a concern acknowledged by DHS, interest groups, academia, and the general public. DHS has developed a set of procedures to address these concerns such as minimization of information collection, training and accountability requirements, and retention rules. Notwithstanding these steps, there are concerns that the program may implicate privacy interests protected under the Fourth Amendment. Although many have argued that there is a need for federal and state governments, and owners and operators of the nation's critical infrastructures, to share information on cyber vulnerabilities and threats, obstacles to information sharing may exist in current laws protecting electronic communications or in antitrust law. Private entities that share information may also be concerned that sharing or receiving such information may lead to increased civil liability, or that shared information may contain proprietary or confidential business information that may be used by competitors or government regulators for unauthorized purposes. Several bills in the 112th Congress would seek to improve the nation's cybersecurity, and may raise some or all of the legal issues mentioned above. For example, H.R. 3523 (Rogers (Mich.)-Ruppersberger) addresses information sharing between the intelligence community and the private sector. H.R. 3674 (Lungren) includes provisions regarding the protection of critical infrastructure, as well as information sharing. H.R. 4257 (Issa-Cummings) would require all federal agencies to continuously monitor their computer networks for malicious activity and would impose additional cybersecurity requirements on all federal agencies. S. 2102 (Feinstein) seeks to facilitate information sharing. S. 2105 (Lieberman) includes the information sharing provisions of S. 2102, as well as provisions relating to the protection of critical infrastructure and federal government networks. S. 2151 (McCain) and H.R. 4263 (Bono-Mack) also addresses information sharing among the private sector and between the private sector and the government. Many of these bills also include provisions specifically addressing the preemption of state laws. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

Based on analyzing traditional bit operation of individual pixels image encryption method, this paper proposed a new encryption algorithm. The new encryption algorithm combined with SBES and chaotic sequence. Firstly, use Logistic chaotic sequence to shuffle the positions of image pixels, then transform it into a binary matrix, and permute the matrix at bit-level by the scrambling mapping generated by SBES. Secondly, use another Logistic chaotic sequence rearrangement of the positions of the current image pixels. In this way, the proposed algorithm transforms drastically the statistical characteristic of original image information, so, it increases the difficulty of an unauthorized individual to break the encryption. The simulation results and the performance analysis show that the algorithm has large secret-key space, high security, fast encryption speed and strong robustness, and is suitable for practical use to protect the security of digital image information over the Internet.","Chaotic sequence; Image encryption; Information security; Space-bit-exchange scheme","Algorithms; Digital image storage; Electronic data interchange; Image processing; Pixels; Security of data; Binary matrix; Bit-operations; Chaotic sequence; Current image; Data storage; Digital image; Encryption algorithms; Image encryptions; Image pixels; Original images; Performance analysis; Space-bit-exchange scheme; Statistical characteristics; Cryptography"

Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory.

To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected.

While focusing on HRIS security we introduce aspects of HRIS security and how it can be enhanced in organizations.

""True least privilege"" is a (mostly) theoretical optimum of exactly only the access provisioning that is required, while most real-world least privilege implementations are ""suboptimal"" in that they overprovision access (e.g. in privilege user account access, government regulations/guidance standards) - with disasters such as the u.s. embassy Wikileaks incident as a result. Least privilege is harder to implement the more optimal it should be, because doiog it right can be highly complex: (I) it requires fine-gralned access policy management that goes beyond identity and roles based access controls, towards attribute-based (ABAC), resource-based (ResBAC), and authorization-based (ZBAC) access controls; (2) access policies need to be highly contextual in order to minimize excess access provisioning; (3) implementing such fine-grained. contextual across policies reliably and verifiably is particularly challenging for today's dynamically changing IT application landscapes such as agile Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) and emerging Cloud mash-ups (with "" Platform as a Service"" PaaS). This paper illustrates how model-driven approaches can be applied to security to implement least privilege closer to its ""true"" optimal. The parts of the proposed solution are: (I) Use ABAC/ResBAC/ZBAC to support fine-grained, contextual access policy management and enforcement; (2) automatically generate and update those access rules for agile SOAs/ Clouds using model-driven security (MDS) policy automation; and: (3) automatically generate least privilege compliance/accreditation evidence using model-driven security accreditation (MDSA) automation. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2012.","","Accreditation; Information services; Laws and legislation; Optimization; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Service oriented architecture (SOA); Access control policies; Access policies; Attribute-based; Government regulation; Guidance document; High-level information; Model driven approach; Model-driven securities; Access control"

Then, the hypothesized relationships are validated using empirical data from 174 information security executives. The results suggest that multiple facets of an information security executive's personality have a significant effect on his or her attitude towards selected information security management activities. For example, conscientiousness is positively related to a person's attitude towards the technical and organizational activities of information security.

Based on empirical studies and information security literature, we examine the effects of selected factors on the number of security incidents. We use a regression model to test the hypotheses empirically and also to study how those factors are affected over time. We found that the number of potential corrupted computers is positively related to the security incidents while the number of potential attackers and range of attack types does not significantly affect the number of security incidents. We also found empirical evidence that factors could significantly change over time.","Empirical study; Intrusion prevention systems; Network and security management; Security incidents; Security metrics","Regression analysis; Empirical studies; Intrusion prevention systems; Security incident; Security management; Security metrics; Security of data"

Nevertheless, most of these methods require specific devices to gain input data. The keystroke dynamics authentication is a biometric technique that requires a common device which is a keyboard. Therefore, this biometric is a very useful technology that can be implemented on various systems over the Internet as long as those users use keyboards. Unfortunately, the defect of using the keystroke dynamics is that the authentication result is invalid when users have different tempers. Thus, the accuracy of the use of the keystroke dynamics can be increased when combining this technique with other biometrics, such as the fingerprint and the iris scan. The unsuitable for these combinations is that special devices are required in the authentication process. So, to eliminate such requirements, this paper proposes the modification of keystroke dynamics biometric by adapting it with the speed of eyes vision in order to increase the higher accuracy of identifying legitimate users. The proposed solution expects that the authentication process can be performed on a basic device such as the keyboard. © 2012 AICIT.","biometrics authentication; eye vision; keystroke dynamics; multibiometrics","Biometrics; Dynamics; Security of data; Authentication systems; Biometric techniques; Biometrics authentication; Input datas; Keystroke dynamics; Legitimate users; Multi-biometrics; Special devices; Authentication"

It is an indispensable part of the information security system. Due to the variety of network data behaviors and the rapid development of attack fashions, it is necessary to develop a fast machine-learning-based intrusion detection algorithm with high detection rates and low false-alarm rates. In this correspondence, we propose a novel fuzzy method with genetic for detecting intrusion data from the network database. Genetic algorithm is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses Directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with a compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with Genetic proposes a new method that can deal with a mixed of database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important association rules to contribute and to enhance the Intrusion data detections ability. Therefore, the proposed method is flexible and can be applied for both misuse and anomaly detection in data-intrusion- detection problems. Also the incomplete database will include some of the missing data in some tuples and however, the proposed methods by applying some rules to extract these tuples. The Genetic- Fuzzy presents a data Intrusion Detection Systems for recovering data. It also include following steps in Genetic-Fuzzy rules: Process data model as a mathematical representation for Normal data. Improving the process data model which improves the Model of normal data and it should represent the underlying truth of normal Data.

These include network management tools, operating systems - especially Linux, Voice Over IP (VOIP) communications technologies, and satellite based augmentation systems for navigation/timing data etc. The increasing use of these common components creates concerns that bugs might affect multiple systems across many different safety-related industries. It also raises significant security concerns. Malware has been detected in power distribution, healthcare, military and transportation infrastructures. Most previous attacks do not seem to have deliberately targeted critical applications. However, there is no room for complacency in the face of increasing vulnerability to cyber attacks on safety-related systems. This paper illustrates the threat to air traffic management infrastructures and goes on to present a roadmap to increase our resilience to future CyberSafety attacks. Some components of this proposal are familiar concepts from Security Management Systems (SecMS), including a focus on incident reporting and the need for improved risk assessment tools. Other components of the roadmap focus on structural and organizational problems that have limited the effectiveness of existing SecMS; in particular there is a need to raise awareness amongst regulators and senior management who often lack the technical and engineering background to understand the nature of the threats to safety-critical software. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2012.","","Accident prevention; Computer operating systems; Internet telephony; Network management; Program debugging; Risk assessment; Security systems; Software engineering; Tools; Communications technology; Network management tools; Organizational problems; Safety critical software; Safety critical systems; Satellite based augmentation systems; Security management systems; Transportation infrastructures; Information management"

The 2010 National Intelligence Annual Threat Assessment states that the United States is ""severely threatened"" by cyber attacks.1 With the increased importance of wars involving nonstate actors, the increase in the number of internal conflicts, and the scope of globalization, some scholars conclude that war and foreign policy have changed since 9/11.2 The belief that war has changed is bolstered by the conjecture that cyberspace is now an important military battlefield. The field of security studies might be considered to be at a crossroads due to these perceptions. Since the beginnings of armed conflict, enemies and combatants have always used the latest technology available to them to gain an advantage. Examples abound of states using technology, digital communication, and scientific espionage to challenge rivals. The difference now is that technology is the battlefield and the tactic at the same time. There is little to disconnect the means and objectives of cyberwar and cyber combat. This potential shift or revolution in foreign policymaking has to be evaluated on these terms. Has cyberspace become the battlefield, and what evidence do we have that this shift has changed relations between states? Yet very little has been done to study the actual impact of new tactics and weapons in the modern international battlefield. What is the true impact of cyberwar on the dynamics of conflict and interstate relations? This important question motivates our study in this volume. This chapter focuses on persistent enemies or rivals. Interstate rivals are those states that perceive the other state as a threat and view interstate relations as a zero-sum game.3 Vasquez defines rivalry as a ""relationship characterized by extreme competition, and usually psychological hostility, in which the issue positions of contenders are governed primarily by their attitude toward each other.""4 To this point the data suggest that such pairs of states have experienced the most war in the interstate system since the end of the Napoleonic wars.5 If one were to predict who will fight whom in the future and which states have realistic security threats, then scholars should rightly focus on rivals as the main unit of interest.6 This study follows this advice and examines the impact of cyberwar or cyber tactics on the dynamics of rivalry. This chapter examines the theoretical and empirical impact of cyber strategies on rivalry relations. What sorts of behavioral expectations can we derive from a theory of information warfare during a rivalry? Our research path follows two lines of questioning. First, which rivals have cyber capabilities? To examine to the extent that informational battle tactics have changed diplomacy and military relations in the modern era, we must first examine the state of actual cyber capabilities. Do rivals have cyber-combat units, and if so, are these units tasked to target rivals or possible inflated threats? Our second question is what impact cyber capabilities have on rivalry relations. If a state has a cyber unit tasked to target a rival, does this operation actually affect interstate relations? To accomplish both tasks we present an examination of a few cases that explore the reach of cyber strategies in modern military structures among the rivalry population. How deeply have cyber capabilities and tactics penetrated rivalry dynamics? If there are cyber capabilities evident, do these tactics escalate tensions? These research questions are important if one is to examine and theorize about the extent and impact of cyber tactics in modern international relations. Before policymakers can discuss the need for cybersecurity or the coming danger of cyberwar, we must first understand the true nature of cyber conflict against dangerous and long-standing enemies. The study of cyberwar must move away from the study of conjecture and fears of the possible and into the study of actual modern enemies' capabilities. This step is important, and this research effort is the first to examine both the theoretical and empirical impact of cyber technologies on conflict dynamics. The chapter proceeds to define the domain of our analysis - cyber conflict - and then moves toward an examination of the importance of rivalry studies. Based on other models of conflict, we theorize about the impact of the cyber tactics of rivals. Finally, our study answers the critical question of who has cyber capabilities and what impact these capabilities have on modern rivalry relations at this point. © 2012 Georgetown University Press.

The intrusion detection system device is one of the most popular equipments forpreventing the network security attack (section 7.1). In section 7.2 is proposed aheterogeneous network sensors management service and a method for analyzes the alertconflict in a heterogeneous network sensor environment using different alert fusiontechnique to understand the security status of the whole network system. The fuzzycognitive maps to fuse multiple inputs are used. As it is known, cryptography is used toprotect data from eavesdropping and to preserve integrity of the data (section 7.3). Aproblem in the field of information security that has no unitary point of view is that ofevaluation of the cryptographic algorithms proposed as public cryptographic standards(section 7.4). Section 7.5 focuses on the link between information security andcryptography that is represented by National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) cryptographic standards, Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS 140-2(Security requirements for cryptographic modules) standard and Common Criteria forInformation Technologies Security Evaluation (ISO 15408) standard. In the last period oftime a growing attention has been given to chaos-based transmission methods in order tobe used for securing communications (section 7.6). Secured chaotic communications are obtained by modulation of the chaotic signal with the informational signal. Theevolutions of two chaotic dynamic systems that have the same attractor, but differentinitial start conditions, will diverge after a certain time, although the evolutions are closeto the common attractor. For this is necessary to synchronise these two systems. Someexamples of data transmission based on simple discrete-time chaotic systems arepresented in section 7.7.Last section presents a FPGA implementation of the Rijndael-AES Crypto-Algorithm.©2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Alert conflict; Attractor; Chaos; Chaotic communications; Chaotic encryption; Chaotic maps.; Confidentiality; Crypto modules; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptography; Distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS); Dynamic system; FIPS 140-2; Fusion technique; Fuzzy cognitive maps; Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM); Game theory; Heterogeneous network sensorenvironment; Information security; Integrity; Intrusion detection; Intrusion detection system (IDS); ISO 15408; Network attack; Networkadministrator; Rational and irrational attackers; Remote invasion; Securing communications; Security evaluation; Situation awareness (SA); Standards; Virus invasion",""

Observations of the sensors are quantized and encrypted before transmission. The encryption method we propose maps the output of the quantizer to one of the possible quantizer output levels randomly according to a probability matrix. This operation is similar to that of a discrete memoryless channel. The intended (ally) fusion center (AFC) is aware of the encryption keys (probabilities) while the unauthorized (third party) fusion center (TPFC) is not. A constrained optimization problem is formulated from the point of view of AFC in order to design its decision rule along with the encryption probabilities. The objective function to be minimized is the error probability of AFC and the constraint is a lower bound on the error probability of TPFC. A good suboptimal solution to this problem is found. Numerical results are presented to show that it is possible to degrade the error probability of TPFC significantly and still achieve very low probability of error for AFC. As the number of levels in the quantizer increases the performance loss of the secure system compared to insecure system is reduced. Compared to the existing data encryption methods, the proposed method is highly scalable since it does not increase the packet overhead or transmit power of the sensors and has very low computational complexity. A scheme is described to randomize the keys so as to defeat any key space exploration attack. © 2012 IEEE.","Decentralized detection; Decision fusion; Information security; Soft decision; Wireless sensor networks","Constrained optimization; Cryptography; Security of data; Sensors; Space research; Wireless sensor networks; Bandwidth-constrained; Binary Hypothesis Testing; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Decentralized detection; Decision fusion; Discrete memoryless channels; Low computational complexity; Soft decision; Probability"

These systems of network defense methods are primarily comprised of static defenses focused on preventing attacks from entering a network by enabling the features of blocking access, requiring authentication, or analyzing traffic. To adapt to the ever-changing threat profile of network attacks, the DiD model must be adapted to be symmetric and focus on new vectors for defense instead of authenticating, blocking, or analyzing all traffic. Instead of a focusing on feature-centric network defense requirements, the DiD model should be redesigned to be a functional or capability focused model. Symmetry in the DiD model allows for the network defense system to recognize the insider threat, preventing data exfiltration and allowing attacks to be stopped at the originating network instead of being defended by the attacked network. Dynamic defenses must also be enabled, which change attack surfaces to proactively defend a network. New vectors, such as dynamic network addressing, enterprise computing resources, and network architectures, must be used by the DiD model to prevent attacks from reaching network, consuming attackers often limited resources, and securing networks in their design and architecture. © 2012 IEEE.","Defense in Depth; Dynamic defense; Information security; Symmetric defense","Network architecture; Security of data; Systems engineering; Data exfiltration; Defense in depth; Dynamic network; Enterprise computing; Network attack; Network defense; Network defense systems; Symmetric defense; Computer crime"

This is especially the case for young adults who have different attitudes towards information security practices. In this research, we examine factors that motivate college students' information security behaviors. Based on the concept of fear arousal in the presence of a threatened event, a well-founded theory known as Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) is adopted in the research model. Social norms and habit factors are integrated to the model as a means to assess students' behaviors of information security. A survey of 202 responses is used to test the designed model using structural equation modeling to analyze relationships among variables. Results indicated that students are very motivated to practice information security if they perceive high levels of severity, response efficacy, response costs and self-efficacy. Their intentions, however, are not affected by perceived vulnerability or by social influence. Our findings suggest that PMT is a valuable model for predicting students' attitudes towards information security and that their motivation is influenced by education in security awareness and understanding severity of such issues.","Computer Security; Curriculum Design and Development; Information Assurance and Security; Privacy; Security","Curricula; Data privacy; Education computing; Motivation; Security of data; Security systems; Curriculum design and development; Information assurance and securities; Information security practice; Protection motivation theory; Security; Security awareness; Structural equation modeling; Students' behaviors; Students"

In particular ground control systems and space-link communications are required to ensure a minimum level of security and robustness. Security requirements are usually established using information risk assessment which evaluates the target systems' vulnerabilities and establishes the identification of potential threats. From this point, the risk assessment evaluates the likelihood of a threat against the severity of identified vulnerabilities and determines a quantifiable risk for each of these combinations. Many risk assessment methodologies such as ISO27005, NIST SP 800-30, or EBIOS exist, but they all face similar problems in practice. The risk assessment process looks easy on paper - but experience within ESA has shown that it can turn into a complex nightmare with unusable results if it is not done right especially when applied to complex systems. In our paper, we address the main pitfalls of risk assessment and how to avoid them. Our contribution is the result of the analysis of a number of ESA risk assessment exercises lessons learned. Some of these risk assessments were very successful while others were not. We elaborate on the following central buzzwords of successful risk assessment: Know your system, Know what is important for your system, Keep it simple, Don't believe you are done after the first round. © 2012 by European Space Agency.","","Robustness (control systems); Rock mechanics; Security of data; Assessment process; Ground control system; Information risk; Lessons learned; Potential threats; Risk assessment methodologies; Security requirements; Space community; Risk assessment"

Thus, a combination of extracted fingerprint features and biocrypto key will entail generating a secure authentication system based on fingerprint impression meant for PARD attack using fingerprint verification through extracting and matching minutiae, and to incorporate the instability of the user's biometric features into the generated key, so as to make the key unguessable to an attacker lacking significant knowledge of the user's biometrics.","Authentication; Biometrics; Decoding; Encoding; Fingerprint; Minutiae features; PARD attack; Security","Authentication; Biometrics; Decoding; Encoding (symbols); Energy conservation; Intelligent systems; Network security; Biometric authentication system; Fingerprint; Fingerprint authentication; Fingerprint impressions; Fingerprint verification; Minutiae feature; PARD attack; Security; Pattern matching"

A risk assessment exercise for an ISMS implementation requires human expertise with comprehensive understanding and considerable knowledge in information security. A common risk assessment exercise is based on three sub-processes, namely, risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation. The lack of tools especially in the automation of risk identification emphasized the need of experienced personnel and this becomes a challenge for organizations seeking compliance with the ISMS standard. This paper proposes a relationship concept in asset and threat identification which is part of the risk identification sub-process. The concept provides a foundation to automate the risk assessment process for an identified scope of an ISMS implementation.","Asset identification; Information security risk; ISMS; Risk assessment; Threat","Industrial management; Regulatory compliance; Risk assessment; Security of data; Asset identification; Information security management systems; Information security risks; International standards; ISMS; Risk Identification; Threat; Threat identification; Information management"

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes an algorithm that employs the Arnold scrambling to preprocess on original watermarking, such that the watermarked medical image technology has security under the cryptography sense, for double protection. Moreover, the algorithm combines the image visual feature vector, encryption technology and the concept of third party, without the sophisticated process to finding the Region of Interest (ROI) of medical images. Therefore, watermarking can be extracted and embedded more faster.

The principal idea is that security can be ensured by exploiting the laws of quantum physics and, in particular, by the fact that any attempt to measure a quantum state will change it uncontrollably. This change can be detected by the legitimate users of the communication channel and so reveal to them the presence of an eavesdropper. In this paper I explain (briefly) how quantum key distribution works and some of the progress that has been made towards making this a viable technology. With the principles of quantum communication and quantum key distribution firmly established, it is perhaps time to consider how efficient it can be made. It is interesting to ask, in particular, how many bits of information might reasonably be encoded securely on each photon. The use of photons entangled in their time of arrival might make it possible to achieve data rates in excess of 10 bits per photon. © 2012 SPIE.","Entanglement; High-bit rate communication; Quantum cryptography","Photons; Quantum communication; Quantum theory; Remote sensing; Security of data; Data rates; Entanglement; Legitimate users; New approaches; Private-key; Quantum physics; Quantum state; Time of arrival; Quantum cryptography"

Protection is not only needed against attacks originating from external networks connected as remote data access, but also from potential attacks originating from locally connected devices connected during regular operation. Relevant use cases comprise local service access and plug-and-play of automation components. A conventional firewall filtering is not sufficient as it filters allowed network traffic depending on the contents of data packets, but it is not aware of specific real-time restrictions that have to be obeyed within an industrial automation network. For these reasons, a solution is required allowing to connect uncontrolled respuntrusted devices with a real-time automation network segment in a secure way. This paper describes the general concept for a network filtering device that supports real-time criteria for making filtering decisions.","Device authentication; Firewall; Network access authentication; Real-time; Security","Computer system firewalls; Electronic equipment; Device authentications; Firewall; Network access authentications; Real-time; Security; Security of data"

Several procedure-oriented maturity models have been proposed for managing the progress on information security, however, few approaches use quantitative techniques for analyzing the progress on information security. In this paper we propose that the problem of becoming security compliance can be analyzed as a problem of multi-paths where checking different controls means choosing different ways of reaching a security compliance. We identify a set of concepts from security ontologies in order to identify a set of variables influencing these paths.

RSA can provide higher security level than ECC, but it is not suitable for the resource-constrained devices such as smart phones or embedded system. Thus, ECC is attracted on application in resource-constrained devices because it can achieve the same security level, but uses less key length than RSA. Galois or finite field multiplication is the core arithmetic operation of ECC. There are three popular bases in the finite field over GF(2m), polynomial basis, normal basis and dual basis (DB). Each basis representation has its own advantages. In this study, the authors will introduce a low-complexity bit-parallel DB multiplier using the multiplexer approach.

This paper presents a model about factors influencing detection of criminal intrusions, based on the military concept of situation awareness (SA). We argue that in using intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to deflect criminal intrusions, SA is critical because of the highly dynamic nature of the task at hand and the information processing capability it requires.

Courts of law depend on the availability, comprehensiveness and quality of information relating to the case in reaching a conclusive and fair verdict. Courts will not be able to deliver justice in the cases where records are not properly managed; thus, depriving the aim of judicial institutions to bestow legal rights to individuals and society. The objective of speedy justice can only be met if all the records relating to the case are available, retrievable and managed throughout the lifecycle properly. This ensures that all the relevant documentation relating to the case conforms to certain standard of quality and is accessible, available, dependable as and when required. The pervasiveness of information and communication technologies (ICTs) provides new opportunities for court automation and information management in judiciary. At the same time there is increased pressure on the courts of law to embrace technology because with the increased level of IT literacy and awareness among the general public, there are increased demands on government to provide information to citizen around the clock. Responding to these opportunities and pressures, courts around the globe are embracing information and communication technologies at various levels to provide faster, reliable and consistent service to the society. Records in court system have various dimensions including court proceedings, evidence, and statutory declarations (affidavits). In addition, court records also contain precedents from old cases and even references to the sources of law. This makes information management in general, and record retrieval in particular an intricate task. This research aims to answer the question of 'How can ICTs allow for better management of court records in Malaysia' using a qualitative interpretive approach with exploratory case study. It attempts to realize the phenomena under investigation through the meanings that people attach to them. In this case, it is the way people manage the life cycle of records management in Shariah Courts. Therefore to address the issue at hand an interpretive task provide a rich understanding of the contextually oriented court records management issues than the more conformist positivist approaches. Public sector organizations are obliged to manage their records in line with legislation and organizational policies. Ensuring compliance with records management obligations can be difficult, especially given the explosion of records in electronic form, most notably e-mail, and the devolution of many records management functions throughout the organization. In Malaysia, the public sector is facing pressing challenges to provide efficient service delivery. E-Shariah was put in place to replace the manual system of all Shariah courts operation. Before E-Shariah come into operation, all business processes from case registration to case disposal were performed manually. It is not surprising that the system was replete in inefficiency and ineptitude. With the increased number of Shariah cases being registered, the delay in case management became more critical. A single case takes years to be settled, resulting in hardship for the parties involved. The major reason for this delay has been the unavailability of complete information as and when required. In certain cases not only the information is incomplete but had been tempered with as well. With the introduction of e-Shariah, the government aim to reduce the time taken to settle a case and to manage each case and related information more efficiently and systematically. With the implementation of EShariah, an electronic network and communication between all 110 Shariah courts in 102 locations nationwide is established, using the electronic government network called EG*Net. The technologies in place in Shariah courts under the E-Shariah project consists of five modules: 1) Shariah Court Case Management System, 2) Shariah Lawyers Management System, 3) Office AutomationSystem, 4) Library Management System, and 5) E-Shariah Portal. E-Shariah has opened up new avenue for court workflow as well as records management in Malaysian Shariah courts. Although there are a number of benefits which hinge upon a few administrative issues, yet there are significant benefits that the use of technology has brought to Shariah courts in terms of case management efficiency, coordination between courts, work process consistency and interoperability, information security, integration with government agencies and trust in judiciary system. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","Court administration; Electronic records management system; Shariah court; Technology adoption","Behavioral research; Communication; Information systems; Interoperability; Laws and legislation; Life cycle; Management information systems; Records management; Security of data; Electronic records managements; Exploratory case studies; Information and communication; Information and Communication Technologies; Interpretive approaches; Public sector organization; Shariah court; Technology adoption; Information management"

Then on the basis of the fixed weight vectors and actual situation, giving the fuzzy evaluation vectors, all the scores of index levels can be valued. This method not only makes evaluation results more in line with objective facts because it combines the objective weight with subjective experience to avoid the subjectivity of previous evaluation, but also makes network and information security evaluation easily on computer. © 2012 IEEE.","comprehensive evaluation of interval-valued; frequent number; index system; membership frequency interval; network information security","Computer science; Frequency intervals; frequent number; Index systems; Interval-valued; Network information; Security of data"

The method proposed in this paper, ERASE, unlike brute force methods, computes the entropy of each data block in the target area, and if the entropy is within the specified sensitivity range, then that block is wiped with a user specified number of passes and pattern. ERASERS, an enhancement to ERASE that employs random sampling, is also proposed. ERASERS divides the given population into numerous subpopulations and uses random sampling to sample blocks from each subpopulation. Then, it computes the entropy of each sampled block, and if the entropy of any sampled block in the subpopulation is within the sensitive entropy range, which is a tunable parameter, then the entire subpopulation is wiped. The random sampling component of ERASERS gives organizations an alternative for a faster wipe as compared to regular brute force methods of overwriting. Our research resulted in different levels of sanitization for different time windows, a factor most organizations will consider when wiping large disks. According to Seagate, in 2011, the average size of hard drives they shipped that year was 590 GB [1]. Overwriting a 590 GB hard drive with one pass of random data, takes approximately 14.6 hours using dd. However, ERASE optimizes the data overwriting process allowing it to sanitize a 590GB hard drive in 9.5 hours, assuming 50% of the data on the drive is within the sensitive entropy range, thereby achieving a performance improvement of approximately 34.8%. If a wipe pattern of 1 pass using /dev/zero as the source is used, dd takes approximately 1.584 hours and ERASERS takes 0.85 hours in its best case performance and 1.580 hours in its worst case performance, assuming 50% of the data is within the sensitive entropy range. Thus, achieving a performance improvement in the range of 0.2% - 46.6%. © 2012 Infonomics Society.","Computer Drive Sanitization; Digital Forensics; Information Security","Electronic crime countermeasures; Entropy; Hard disk storage; Internet; Security of data; Different time windows; Digital forensic; Digital storage media; Performance improvements; Privacy preservation; Sanitization; Sensitivity range; Worst-case performance; Digital storage"

We propose a discipline we term trust engineering, which considers the interactions of trust-enhancing technology, system architecture, and the development life cycle. The traditional view of security solutions have focused on preventing external threats such as malware in the forms of viruses, hackers and worms through perimeter from penetrating the organizations system where solutions that include firewalls and antivirus software were the leading mitigating techniques. While still aware of outside threats, companies are now coming to understand they can no longer ignore inside violations concerning data at rest or data on the move in order to protect the organization's private and confidential information. So information security and privacy is quickly becoming critical whether it is internal or external. This paper investigates trust-enhancing approaches, articulating a strategy based on three main thrusts: developing secure software systems (confidence), executing software in a protected, controlled environment (control), and monitoring software for cyber threats (discovery). Applying these three thrusts in combination with the proper architectural and life cycle perspective provides the best strategy for increasing our trust in software-based and service-based systems. © 2012 IEEE.","","Computer worms; Life cycle; Military communications; Personal computing; Security of data; Viruses; Antivirus softwares; At rests; Confidential information; Controlled environment; Cyber threats; Engineering frameworks; Life cycle perspectives; Malwares; Secure software; Security solutions; Service-based systems; Software-based; System architectures; Computer viruses"

Using cluster analysis and t-tests, we found that three clusters of security practices are significantly associated with different levels of perceived compliance. We demonstrated significant differences among non-technical practices rather than technical practices, and the highest levels of compliance are associated with hospitals that employed a balanced approach between technical and non-technical practices (or between one-time and cultural practices).

This paper presents a model driven approach whereby security systems in operation can be assessed and measured against various requirements that are defined when the system is created. By aligning with organisational policy, and business requirements of a specific system, design and operation can proceed in a way that allows measurement of how successfully security objectives are being achieved. This paper describes a model driven approach which overcomes the contextual restrictions of existing solutions. In particular, where models have been used previously these have tended to be predefined and closed models, whereas the approach described here is an extensible model that comprises all parts of the security monitoring and decision support process. By means of interlinked semantic concepts, the proposed security strategy meta model provides a way to model security directives at an abstract level, which can be automatically compiled into specific rules for an underlying framework of monitoring, decision support, and enforcement engines. © 2012 ACM.","decision support; governance and compliance; information security measurement model; security information and event management; security monitoring; security strategy","Security of data; Semantics; Decision supports; Event management; governance and compliance; Information-security measurement; Security monitoring; Security strategies; Decision support systems"

Previous research on router security is mostly about the technology of exploiting known flaws of routers. Fuzzing is a famous automated vulnerability finding technology, however, traditional Fuzzing tools are designed for testing network applications or other software. These tools are not or partly not suitable for testing routers. This paper designs a framework of discovering router protocol vulnerabilities, and proposes a mathematical model Two-stage Fuzzing Test Cases Generator (TFTCG) that improves previous methods to generate test cases. We have developed a tool called RPFuzzer based on TFTCG. RPFuzzer monitors routers by sending normal packets, keeping watch on CPU utilization and checking system logs, which can detect DoS, router reboot and so on. RPFuzzer'debugger based on modified Dynamips, which can record register values when an exception occurs. Finally, we experiment on the SNMP protocol, find 8 vulnerabilities,of which there are five unreleased vulnerabilities.

Experience and lessons learnt from mission support in Afghanistan's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Libya (Operation Unified Protector OUP) have shown that deploying NNEC capabilities from scratch is complex and time consuming. Therefore, NATO and the Nations have decided to formalize the implementation of NNEC into a flexible, tailor-able and scalable capability known as the Future Mission Network (FMN). The FMN seeks to implement a NNEC-aligned set of network, systems and services, along with the necessary doctrine and processes, to facilitate federation of mission information and supporting capabilities in future operations.

The result of this information flooding is the inability to correctly correlate the events to locate the security breach.

The dimensionality of these matrices is reduced using principal component analysis and diffusion map methodology. Abnormal log lines can then be analyzed in more detail. We expand our previous work by elaborating the cluster analysis after obtaining the low-dimensional representation. The framework was tested with actual server log data collected from a large web service. Several previously unknown intrusions were found.

More and more researchers are attracted to software security testing study. Most of them put their works on software access control model based testing, which takes into account information mainly on multidimensions, like roles, permissions and contexts. But the key disadvantage of access control model based testing is its model are hard to be built in many circumstance, for example, to describe requirement ""picture A is only allowed to be copied twice outside terminal B"", researcher has to extend the original model with hierarchy status and priority sub models. To overcome this disadvantage, this paper present a framework of data oriented access control testing method, which focus mainly on data and its actions instead of role, permission and contexts. Though experiments, this paper also proves that the method is much more instructive than access control model in test cases automatic generating. © 2012 IEEE.","Access control model; Model based testing; Security testing","Access control; Communication; Measurements; Access control models; Built in; Intelligent devices; Model based testing; Original model; Security testing; Software security testing; Submodels; Test case; Testing method; Software testing"

Despite its common use in the Safety domain, the ACA concept had not been applied to a dynamic situation. It allowed for Cases to be clustered using a 'Mesh'Case to summarise a particular ecosystem/environment. This ACA is defined using basic elements of an assurance case ie Claim, argument and evidence - often associated with a legal analogy. Using the case study research method [27], the main methodology as stated in the paper combined the organisational learning cycle [1] with the 6-step based process based on a GSN [16] and CAE [2] notational hybrid for the construction of an argument structure. This was implemented with a CII asset, and further pilotted to demonstrate the ACA for other CII nodes [13]. The clustering using the 'Mesh'cases closely aligns with Interdependency Analysis for the UK interconnected system-of-systems. Further work is required to expand the 'Mesh' case principle for the 21st century information-centric ecosystem to provide a continual resilience work process framework, which eventually must include real-time inputs.","Assurance case; Cyber-security; Information security; Information-centric","Critical infrastructures; Large scale systems; Argument structures; Assurance case; Critical information infrastructure protections; Cyber security; Information-centric; Interdependency analysis; National infrastructure; Organisational learning cycles; Security of data"

Image morphing can hide a secret image in a morphed image using a second, reference image. One of the primary methods to make the morphing based information hiding technology practically useful is interactive evolutionary algorithm (IEA). When using IEA, however, the user who is rating the images for their naturalness must rate a large amount of images. During this period of time, it is possible for the user to subconsciously shift the rating criteria, thus skewing the results of the algorithm. To help solve this problem, we propose a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) reminder, which analyzes the user's previous inputs and creates an estimated fitness rating for images to aid the user in grounding his or her ratings. We ran experiments testing the differences in using the IEA with and without the k-NN reminder, looking to see what impact the algorithm had on the speed of the analysis and the ease of the user's rating ability. Results show that in many instances, the k-NN makes it easier for the user to maintain a standard criterion for the rating of images, with no noticeable impact on the speed of the process. © 2012 IEEE.","image morphing; Information hiding; interactive differential evolution; k-nearest neighbor algorithm; steganography","Ability testing; Evolutionary algorithms; Pattern recognition; Security of data; Steganography; Differential Evolution; Image morphing; Information hiding; Information hiding technology; Interactive evolutionary algorithms; K nearest neighbor algorithm; K-nearest neighbors; Rating abilities; Rating"

In July 2011, Syn and Nackrst1 explored this topic by analysing seven countries from a wide spectrum across the globe for network security vulnerabilities. The countries selected were China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, India, Mexico and Romania. Their method utilises Nmap and Nessus to probe and test for network vulnerabilities from each respective nation, in order to collect quantitative data for national vulnerability volumes. The Vulnerability statistics collected are of four categories; High, Medium, Low and Open Ports. This paper extends Syn and Nackrst1's work by constructing a more detailed analysis of their results, showing the number of real-world vulnerabilities per nation; the differences between national levels of network security, the ratios of vulnerabilities/IP address; and vulnerability summary rankings. Multiple causal factors are also looked at to quantify the reasoning behind the varying levels of vulnerabilities per nation. This paper concludes that each nation has millions of vulnerabilities of varying amounts, and therefore, each nation differs in network security levels. Mexico and India exhibited the most worrying statistics, with the highest number of high level vulnerabilities/IP address ratio. Ultimately, this paper highlights the vulnerability levels that organisations are faced with when engaging in foreign and domestic outsourcing. © 2012 IEEE.","Application security; Global; Information security; Nessus; Network security; Nmap; Outsourcing; Vulnerability testing","Internet; Outsourcing; Security of data; Application security; Global; Nessus; Nmap; Vulnerability testing; Network security"

Unfortunately, the amount of security incidents is not declining but quite the contrary. We suggest that IS scholars should take a new approach in investigation of this problem; that is, the study of ISC should not be separated from other aspects of culture as prior research suggests that the various aspects interact and influence each other. In particular, the concept of national culture in so far as it applies to IS security culture has been practically dismissed by prior research while it is an important factor to consider in the modern global world.

This need has been motivated by the emergence of a number of wireless services which require the channel to provide very low bit error rates (BER) along with information security. This paper investigates the feasibility of using chaotic communications over Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by combining chaos modulation with a suitable Space Time Block Code (STBC). It is well known that the use of Chaotic Modulation techniques can enhance communication security. However, the performance of systems using Chaos modulation has been observed to be inferior in BER performance as compared to conventional communication schemes. In order to overcome this limitation, we have proposed the use of a combination of Chaotic modulation and Alamouti Space Time Block Code. We have studied the performance of Chaos Shift Keying (CSK) with 2×1 Alamouti scheme for different chaotic maps over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels. Our simulations indicate that the use of the Alamouti schemes can allow service providers to enhance security without degrading the BER performance while communicating over these channels. © 2012 IEEE.","chaotic techniques; CSK; MIMO","Chaotic systems; Communication systems; Information theory; MIMO systems; Modulation; Radar; Security of data; Turbo codes; White noise; Additive White Gaussian noise; Alamouti scheme; Alamouti space time block codes; BER performance; Chaos modulation; Chaos-shift keying; Chaotic communications; Chaotic map; Chaotic modulations; Chaotic techniques; Communication schemes; Communication security; CSK; Multiple-input multiple-output channels; Performance of systems; Secure communications; Secure wireless communication; Service provider; Space- time block code (STBC); Wireless services; Space-time block coding (STBC)"

Alert correlation techniques have been proposed to reduce the number of alerts and provide a succinct and high-level view of attacks. Most of the existing approaches rely on a priori and hard-coded domain knowledge that leads to their difficult implementation and limited capabilities of detecting new attack strategies. To address the drawbacks of these approaches, the recent trend of research in this area has gone towards extracting attack strategies through automatic analysis of intrusion alerts. In this paper, we present new algorithms to mine attack behavior patterns from a large number of intrusion alerts without specific prior knowledge about attacks. Unlike expert knowledge-based methods, our proposed scheme automatically generates correlation rules from the previously observed alerts using a Bayesian causality mechanism. The attack activity patterns learned by this way can help us to correlate alerts, reconstruct attack scenarios and predict possible forthcoming attacks in a real-time system. Our experimental results clearly show efficiency of the proposed method in learning new attack strategies. © 2012 IEEE.","Alert Correlation; Bayesian Network; Intrusion Detection; Network Security","Intrusion detection; Knowledge based systems; Network security; Real time systems; Activity patterns; Alert correlation; Attack strategies; Automatic analysis; Automatic-learning; Effective analysis; Knowledge-based methods; Security administrator; Bayesian networks"

However, the communication patterns in mission-oriented tactical networks are highly variable and have a much richer structure than incorporated by existing anomaly detection methods. For instance, the legitimacy of a communication may depend on who sends the message to who, when and under what circumstances. Existing anomaly detection methods insensitively aggregate data losing critical contextual information about the structure of communication and as a consequence, they either fail to detect suspicious communication or produce excessive amount of false positives. We have developed an extended graph based anomaly detection method that allows us to incorporate the context and rich structure of communication in a mission-oriented tactical network to model and detect suspicious patterns. We use a vector-weighted multidigraph representation to model communication and use a given data to learn the graph, i.e., to determine the nodes, the edges, and their statistical attributes corresponding to normal communication. We then use deviations from the attributes of normal communications to detect the suspicious ones. We have applied the proposed approach to detect suspicious communication in a MANET comprising of USRP2 radios and successfully demonstrated the approach in TRL-6 demonstration of the TITAN project at Fort Dix. While our proposed approach is very general, only a part of it applies to the MANET under consideration and we used it to successfully detect various types of illegal messages, congestion, and the DDoS attack. © 2012 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; Empirical distribution estimation; Graph based anomaly detection; Information assurance; MANETs","Graphic methods; Military communications; Mobile ad hoc networks; Aggregate datum; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection methods; Communication pattern; Contextual information; DDoS Attack; Empirical distributions; False positive; Fort Dix; Graph-based; Information assurance; MANETs; Mission-oriented; Multi-digraphs; Rich structure; Statistical anomaly detection; Tactical network; Communication"

Basic security mechanisms normally based on passwords for the authentication of social-network users are widely deployed and poses a threat for the user security. In particular, for dedicated social groups with high confidentiality and privacy demands, stronger and user friendly principles for the authentication and identification of group members are needed. On the other hand, most of the mobile units already provide strong authentication procedures through the USIM/ISIM module. This paper explores how to build an architectural framework for secure enrolment and identification of group members in dedicated closed social groups using the USIM/SIM authentication and in particular, the 3GPP Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA), which is built upon the USIM/SIM capabilities. One part of the research is to identify the marketable use-cases with corresponding security challenges to fulfil the requirements that extend beyond the online connectivity.

In general, the design of hash functions should satisfy three standards: pre-image resistance, second pre-image resistance and collision resistance. The design of hash functions in the literature assumes that the messages to be transmitted are equally probable. In this paper, we focus on the pre-image resistance and investigate the problem of mapping design for hash function utilizing the unequal occurrence probabilities of the messages. We first present a necessary condition for the optimal mapping and then introduce a heuristic algorithm. Simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed new design. It is shown that the probability of successful attack can be significantly reduced compared with the conventional design. Our algorithm can be useful in scenarios where the attacker has limited ability or time to estimate the probability distribution of the messages.

In this paper we argue that MLS cannot facilitate the right balance between need-to-protect and duty-to-share as required for a Network Enabled Capability (NEC) based military operations. This is due to the fact that MLS is deemed rigid in its restrictions; it obstructs the flow of information towards lower classifications by definition and thus influences duty-to-share; furthermore MLS results in a set of rigid preconditions for the physical environment to guarantee the required need-to-protect. The focus of a security solution instead should be on flexibility towards information sharing and reducing risks to be useful in a NEC environment. This can be achieved by firstly reducing the size (and complexity) of the systems that contain the classified information systems, using Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) to create these smaller, separated compartments; and secondly controlling the information flow between the (different) classified compartments by dynamic policies. Moreover, the realignment of classification provisions can make management of information much more flexible and efficient. Hence, we can finally forget MLS.","Classified information; Information security; MILS; MLS; Policies","Military applications; Military operations; Public policy; Security of data; Classified information; Dynamic policy; Information flows; Information sharing; MILS; MLS; Multi-level security; Multiple independent levels of securities; Network-enabled capabilities; Physical environments; Security solutions; Classification (of information)"

The objective of this paper is to incorporate several enhancements starting with feature selection and then applying Fuzzy Logic to enhance Genetic Algorithm (GA). Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

Among the various wireless security techniques, user authentication is one essential measure to identify legitimate users and protect the integrity of transmissions. In this paper, a novel physical layer authentication scheme is proposed to enhance the communication security by exploiting the unique characteristics of oscillator in each communication device. In realistic scenarios, radio frequency (RF) oscillators in each transmitter and receiver pair always present some bias to the nominal carrier frequency due to manufacturing limitations and operating conditions. This bias is characterized by a device-dependent carrier frequency offset (CFO), which can be used to identify a specific wireless transmitter. In the proposed authentication scheme, the CFO at different time of the received signal is first estimated. It is then examined by a hypothesis testing to determine whether the signal has the consistent CFO for authentication purpose. Adaptive thresholds of CFO variation are derived for user discrimination based on the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in multipath fading environments. © 2012 IEEE.","","Network layers; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Security of data; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adaptive thresholds; Authentication scheme; Carrier frequency; Carrier frequency offsets; Communication device; Communication security; Critical challenges; Fading environment; Hypothesis testing; Legitimate users; OFDM systems; Operating condition; Physical layers; Radio frequencies; Realistic scenario; Received signals; Signaltonoise ratio (SNR); Transmission schemes; Transmitter and receiver; User authentication; Wireless channel; Wireless communications; Wireless security; Wireless transmitter; Authentication"

Anti-malware applications represent one of the most important research topics in the area of information security threat. As a countermeasure, enhanced systems for analyzing the behavior of malware are needed in order to predict malicious actions and minimize computer damages. Many researchers use Virtual Machine (VM) systems to monitor malware behavior, but there are many Anti-VM techniques which are used to counteract the collection, analysis, and reverse engineering features of the VM based malware analysis platform. Therefore, malware researchers are likely to obtain inaccurate analysis from the VM based approach.

To identify systemic factors affecting the exchange of information between the rescuers (source) and staff (receptor) during the rescue work in the mine. Methodology. The theoretical methods applied included: the theoretical analysis of the symbolic model, the methods of abstraction, formalization, axioms, deduction, induction, and the experimental methods were: development of a landmark model for information exchange between the source and receptor. Findings. The sign model showing the exchange of information between the rescuers (source) and staff (a receptor of information) during the rescue work in the mine has been created. Systems analysis of the model revealed 30 factors that influence the effectiveness of the rapid exchange of information between the source and receptor. In analyzing the model we have taken into account the processes occurring within the source and receptor systems, as well as external factors. The internal factors include: the internal entropy of information, its change in time, information noise in the systems, changes in the systems as information-carrying medium, coding and appearing of elements of disinformation, the impact of imperfections in the source and receptor systems, the scattering of information within the systems, the psychophysical factors, partial decoding of information, change of information during its assimilation in the source and receptor systems, information security, etc. External factors include the information turbulence, scattering and leakage in the transmission medium, entropy, the introduction of external information noise, special disinformation, changes of the transmission medium, etc. It is shown that the total effect of the identified factors make the adequate exchange of information between the source of information (rescuers) and receptor (HQ) impossible. We have made the conclusion about the need to find new principles for emergency communication between the mine and the surface. Originality. Theoretical analysis of the sign model of information exchange between the source and the receptor revealed systemic factors affecting the exchange of information between rescuers and the headquarters during rescue work in the mine. It showed the inadequacy and the difficulty of exchange of operational information between the source and receptor. Practical value.

In this paper, a novel data hiding mechanism based on the application of Rubik's cubic algorithm is proposed. The rationale of adopting Rubik's cubic is due to it possesses 6 faces and can be divided into 54 (6 faces33) elements for scrambling process. In the beginning, the embedded image will be partitioned into different unit block sizes such pixel based, 33 pixels based, or other mn pixels based. After then, 54 units will be selected sequentially and transformed into 6 faces according to the six faces of a Rubik's cubic by designated an index number. Therefore, an image can be partitioned into a lot of different 54 units based block and formed a lot of different Rubik's cubic. Each Rubik's cubic will be assigned a different random number for performing rotation to scramble the sequence of original 54 units. The proposed data hiding mechanism can achieve the benefits of reversible and lossless reconstruction of hidden data and host image without utilizing any information from the original host image. It is not only obtaining good visual quality for the stego-image, but also possesses high hiding capacity. Moreover, the proposed data hiding mechanism can be performed in spatial domain, frequency domain, and hybrid domains. It is also can be combined with encipher system to strengthen data security. © 2012 IEEE.","Data Hiding; Information security; Rubik's cubic","Algorithms; Digital libraries; Pixels; Security of data; Block sizes; Confidential information; Cubic algorithm; Data hiding; Digital right management; Embedded images; Frequency domains; Hiding capacity; Host images; Hybrid domain; Image data hiding; Index numbers; Lossless reconstruction; Random Numbers; Rubik's cubic; Spatial domains; Stego image; Visual qualities; Steganography"

The most popular policies are rule based which have been shown to have clear limitations. In this paper we consider a new approach that we term analyze-modify that ensures strong user passwords while maintaining usability. In our approach we develop a software system called AMP that first analyzes whether a user proposed password is weak or strong by estimating the probability of the password being cracked. AMP then modifies the password slightly (to maintain usability) if it is weak to create a strengthened password. We are able to estimate the strength of the password appropriately since we use a probabilistic password cracking system and associated probabilistic context-free grammar to model a realistic distribution of user passwords. In our experiments we were able to distinguish strong passwords from weak ones with an error rate of 1.43%. In one of a series of experiments, our analyze-modify system was able to strengthen a set of weak passwords, of which 53% could be easily cracked to a set of strong passwords of which only 0.27% could be cracked with only a slight modification to the passwords. In our work, we also show how to compute and use various entropy measures from the grammar and show that our system remains effective with continued use through a dynamic updating capability.

Beginning with the principle that information security is necessary but not sufficient for privacy, we present an innovative layered framework - the Privacy Security Trust (PST) Framework - which integrates, in one model, the different activities practitioners must undertake for effective privacy practice. The PST Framework considers information security, information management and data protection legislation as privacy hygiene factors, representing the minimum processes for effective privacy practice. The framework also includes privacy influencers - developed from previous research in information security culture, information ethics and information culture - and privacy by design principles. The framework helps to deliver good privacy practice by providing: 1) a clear hierarchy of the activities needed for effective privacy practice; 2) delineation of information security and privacy; and 3) justification for placing data protection at the heart of those activities involved in maintaining information privacy.

This is a key question for Western military organizations after the Iraq War and its consequences. All human crises are manmade because of we are human beings. The spreading of individual risk also increases systemic risk. The root cause of the problem is what has been termed ""rational irrationality"" - behavior that, on the individual level, is perfectly reasonable but that, when aggregated in a complex system, produces calamity (Alpaslan & Mitroff 2010, xvii). From the perspective of organizational adaptation and learning, March (1991) argues that a significant number of competencies needs to be learnt and unlearnt during each and every process of change. According to Birkinshaw and Gibson (2011, 2004), in many sports, ambidexterity is a competitive advantage. Footballers are encouraged to use both left and right foot; left-handed batsmen have a slight advantage against right handed bowlers; the southpaw boxer presents a rarely encountered challenge to a boxer with an orthodox stance; some ambidextrous tennis players even use both hands, separately, to play strokes during a rally. And while some individuals are naturally twohanded or two-footed, many work hard to gain an advantage by practising until they master ambidexterity. The challenge for public security and safety organizations is that with terrorism and changes brought on by cybersecurity they are faced with their greatest challenge since the end of World War Two. Not only are the structures and operating procedures undergoing change but also attitudes and values are pressed on by a changing society. Rational black and white thinking no longer functions when immigrants, various ethnic backgrounds, social media and the operating mechanisms and values of market economy force their way into the training grounds of military bases and battlefields. This article examines the usefulness of the concept of ambidexterity as part of the Comprehensive Approach planning and decision-making process adopted by Western military organizations.","Ambidexterity; Comprehensive approach (CA); Planning process","Competition; Military operations; Societies and institutions; SportS; Ambidexterity; Competitive advantage; Comprehensive approach (CA); Cyber security; Decision making process; Human being; Individual risks; Iraq War; Market economies; Military organizations; Military planning; Operating mechanism; Organizational adaptation; Planning process; Public security; Right handed; Root cause; Safety organizations; Social media; Tennis players; Twohanded; World war; Rational functions"

The main variables to be considered are defined and their possible values are proposed. These variables are obtained by means of an interpretative epistemological approach, through a literature review, the use of research methods of Contents Analysis, Focus Group and the General Morphologic Analysis method. To respond in an integrated manner to the three questions above, the model considers the possible incidents of information security in Information Systems, taking into account primarily the main components of the security risks of Information Systems that collect, store, process, transmit and disseminate the information. Its operation is guided by the military concepts of Information Warfare, Information Assurance, the most important principles of war applied to Defensive Operations and the military doctrine of Information Operations. Given the type of problem identified in the study, focusing primarily on the analysis of scenarios of information security incidents and interconnection with the planning and selection of security controls, the method used is the General Morphological Analysis. This method allows for the prediction of possible scenarios of incidents related to information security at the organizational level, which results in the selection of the most efficient solution of security controls, to maximize the security of information.

The degree of information security threats evolving on a daily basis has increasingly raised concerns for enterprise organizations. These threats include but are not limited to fraud, insider threat and intellectual property (IP) theft. These have increased the demand for organizations to implement corporate forensics as a deterrent to illegitimate acts or for linking perpetrators to their illegitimate acts. This explains why forensic practices are expanding from the traditional role in law enforcement and becoming an essential part of business processes. However, most organizations may not be maximizing the benefits of corporate forensic capabilities because of lack of corporate forensic governance best practices, needed to ensure organizations prepare their operating environment for digital forensic investigation. Corporate forensic governance will help ensure that digital evidence is obtained in an efficient and effective way with minimal interruption to the business.

Vulnerability expresses the likelihood that a threat agent acting against an asset will cause impact, for example, the likelihood that an attacker will be able to crack a password or break into a system. This likelihood depends on the capabilities of the threat agent and the strength of the controls in place. In this paper, we provide a framework for estimating these three variables based on the Elo rating used for chess players. This framework re-interprets security from the field of Item Response Theory. By observing the success of threat agents against assets, one can rate the strength of threats and controls, and predict the vulnerability of systems to particular threats. The application of Item Response Theory to the field of risk is new, but analogous to its application to children solving math problems. It provides an innovative and sound way to quantify vulnerability in models of (information) security.","Control strength; Elo; Item Response Theory; Rating systems; Risk assessment; Security metrics; Threat capability; Vulnerability","Security of data; Elo; Item response theory; Rating system; Security metrics; Threat capability; Vulnerability; Risk assessment"

Since organizations have extensive sunk costs invested in their risk management programs, there exists a need to extend and improve existing approaches. Additionally, many quantitative approaches are difficult to implement without mathematical expertise or specialized tools, focus on quantifying individual vulnerabilities, provide little insight into underlying process gaps affecting IT risk and do not facilitate including environmental factors in risk ratings. Our research focuses on identifying attributes or characteristics of risk that are missing from existing approaches, and quantifying their relevance using statistical analysis techniques. We seek to identify and quantify attributes that further close the gap between enumerating IT risks and understanding the actual risk they present. In this paper we identify the relationship between risk findings as a key attribute, and demonstrate using correlation to quantify the relationship. Correlation analysis enables organizations to uncover process gaps, and situations where default risk ratings may not be sufficient. In this paper, we discuss the benefits of correlating risk findings and demonstrate value and feasibility through an empirical case study. © 2012 IEEE.","correlation; information security; risk analysis","Optical correlation; Research; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security of data; Correlation analysis; Default risk; Empirical case studies; Environmental factors; Key attributes; New approaches; Quantitative approach; Quantitative information; Research focus; Risk management program; Risk ratings; Specialized tools; Sunk cost; Information technology"

Like all other aspects of cyberspace, space systems and their terminals are, and will continue to be, beset by numerous cyberspace threats throughout their system lifecycles. Much of the effort to manage cyberspace threats has focused on operational systems and environments. In addition, within the acquisition arena, most risk management activities conducted by the system's Program Office focus on programmatic risks. For cybersecurity, seldom are programmatic impacts considered along with operational impacts. As such, decision-makers do not have a complete picture of how cyberspace threats, and their potential responses, impact the warfighter throughout the system acquisition and development lifecycle, nor into system operations. This paper describes a risk prioritization approach within a security risk management methodology designed to ensure that operational impacts are considered along with acquisition impacts in assessing cybersecurity risk. It is a hybrid cybersecurity risk prioritization approach that utilizes the advantages of both the Multi- Attribute Utility Theory and Analytical Hierarchy Process to account for both acquisition and operational impacts. It incorporates Multi-Attribute Utility Theory to normalize and aggregate multiple impact types, while adding the Analytical Hierarchy Process to weight the impact types based on leadership perspectives. This integration enables the decision-maker to compare cybersecurity risk responses alongside programmatic risk responses.","Cybersecurity; Risk prioritization; Threat; Vulnerability","Mergers and acquisitions; Risk management; Safety engineering; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Communications capability; Communications systems; Critical elements; Cyber security; Cyberspaces; Decision makers; Ground based; Management activities; Multi-attribute utility theory; Multiple impact; Operational impacts; Operational systems; Programmatic impact; Programmatic risks; Risk prioritization; Risk response; SPACE system; Space-based; System acquisition; System operation; Threat; Utility theory; Vulnerability; Warfighters; Computers"

This threat was not cyber-attack by governments or terrorists, but the threat of a militaristic approach to cyber-security. The US and UK military establishments (among others) made strong arguments about the need to expand their online presence from use of the Internet for their own information transmission and into cyber-attack capabilities. Responding to claims of the Russian and Chinese governments sponsoring cracking attacks against Estonia, Georgia and Google, cyberspace in 2011 became the fifth arena of warfare (land, (under)sea, air, space and now cyberspace). Although development of the basic concept and protocols of the Internet was funded by DARPA, a military research agency, the military and civilian uses of Internet systems rapidly diverged in the early days. This separation allowed the development of a free, generative and borderless Internet whose base flexibility and civilian orientation made it one of the core technologies of modern life by 2011. Just as it has become an essential platform for legitimate activity, illegitimate activity has also flourished online. The very automation which makes computers and the Internet so valuable can also be utilised for negative purposes such as Denial of Service Attacks, malware distribution and fraud. There are claims that some governments are sponsoring attacks and cyber-espionage against their enemies (other states or large corporations), and claims about the rise and dangers of cyber-terrorism. Military forces, faced with a diminishing role in preparations for large scale physical conflicts, have begun claiming that civilian cyberspace needs to be (re-)militarised and that the armed forces should be given both the technical tools and the legal rights to conduct not just cyber-defence activities, but offensive cyber-attacks. In this paper we argue from both philosophical and practical standpoints that a pacifist approach to cyber-security is more appropriate. Based on the constitutional pacifism of Germany and Japan, we argue that investment in cyber-defence would be better targetted at improving the physical and electronic infrastructure of the Internet in general (for example, by funding the free distribution of malware signatures to all users or research and development of better technological security tools). This would provide better cybersecurity for the citizens of the world than an arms race to develop military cyber-attack capabilities.

One can think of IT and Communication (ITC) as a greater scope that include both IT and Telecommunication. However, this does not hold true for a company with critical infrastructures such as energy generation and transmission. In this particular market segment, the Telecommunications Department maintains the responsibility of directly addressing issues dealing with business support functions, such as teleprotection infrastructure. In addition, continuous increase in technology convergence and real-time applications can better support the tendency for conducting business in a computer-integrated world. This requires Information Security to play a vital and key role in Corporate Governance to assure available and reliable information flows in a secure, reliable and confidential manner. Brazil's government has acknowledged the importance of Information Security; especially relating to critical infrastructures. Brazil's ""Institutional Security Office"" [1] has established the ""Department of Information Security and Communications"" [2], whose key mission is to manage Information Security for the Federal Government. Chesf (Companhia Hidro Elétrica do São Francisco), also part of Eletrobras, the largest energy producer in Brazil and an energy transmission company, has established its Information Security Policy (ISP) to align with the overall strategic planning goals of the company, thus standardizing processes and procedures to help maintain a more secure and controlled environment for its information assets. The ISP recommends an implementation program for telecommunications assets and is based upon the industry's ""best practices"" for information security management and the recommendations from the ISO/IEC 27000 family standard [3]. The Telecommunications Department followed the above recommendation and examined the overall vulnerabilities found within the telecommunication assets, classifying them based upon probability, impact and business severity and obtained a risk score for all joined assets under evaluation. The assets were then classified under four main assets segments: organizational processes, human resources, physical environment and technology equipment. The final product resulted in a thorough list of all types of assets that directly or indirectly support the telecommunications business process. Finally, once the asset list is mapped into a governance map, it displayed where the telecommunication segment was vulnerable and how best to allocate resources to focus on the critical assets at hand to decrease the vulnerability. This article presents the main results obtained and the accompanying challenges uncovered from various asset vulnerabilities related to Information Security.","Information; Risk; Security; Telecommunication; Vulnerability","Critical infrastructures; Industrial management; Industry; Public works; Risks; Security of data; Telecommunication; Business Process; Business support; Controlled environment; Corporate governance; Critical asset; Energy generations; Energy producers; Energy transmission; Federal governments; Information; Information assets; Information flows; Information security managements; Information security policies; ISO/IEC; Market segment; Organizational process; Physical environments; Processes and procedures; Real-time application; Risk score; Security; Technology convergence; Technology equipment; Teleprotection; Vulnerability; Information technology"

Recent declarations from the UK and USA governments about setting up new cybersecurity organisations and the appointment of cyber czars reflect a global recognition that the Internet is part of the national critical infrastructure that needs to be safeguarded and protected. South Africa still needs a national cybersecurity governance structure in order to effectively control and protect its cyber infrastructure. Structures need to be in place to set the security controls and policies and also to govern their implementation. It is important to have a holistic approach to cybersecurity, with partnerships between business, government and civil society put in place to achieve this goal. The aim of this paper is to propose an approach that South Africa could follow in implementing its proposed cybersecurity policy. This paper investigates different government organisational structures created for the control of national cybersecurity in selected countries of the world. The main contribution is a proposed structure that could be suitable for South Africa, taking into account the challenges of legislation and control of cybersecurity in Africa, and in particular, South Africa.","Cybersecurity; Cybersecurity awareness toolkit; Governance; National security; Policy implementation","Civil society; Cyber infrastructures; Cyber security; Governance; Governance structures; Holistic approach; National security; Organisational structure; Security controls; South Africa; Public policy"

With the advances in technology, a chip-invasive method of attack which uses laser or focused ion beam (FIB) to change the chip's internal signal line, and then probe the chip's secret information with the electron microprobe, becomes a serious threat to information security chip. Such an attack makes the shielding metal wire an effective mean to improve chip security. The protection circuit module monitoring the shielding metal line is to ensure the layer of the metal wire is undamaged, in order to ensure that the chip has not been attacked by laser or FIB.

To date, incremental improvements in MOSA based design methods have demonstrated additional cost reduction, sustainability, and new capability insertion benefits. This has been achieved by further addressing MOSA modularity, key interface standards, and standards conformance. The actual implementation of MOSA is typically guided by both customer-based procurement Statement-of-Work (SOW) language and supplier lessons-learned in execution of MOSA based programs. Implementation of MOSA has evolved and continues to change with regard best practices. New emerging government guidance on MOSA includes: increased government rights availability, encouraging increased competition in procurements, enabling reuse of pre-developed application software components, and sharing of common hardware developments across platform communities. Most MOSA programs are dealing with systems with multiple baselines: production, tech refresh, export derivatives, and future capability/opportunity extensions. Integrated MOSA programmatic and technical views can be a unifying element in assuring that the reference architecture decisions are balanced in near term solutions and life cycle benefits. This paper describes an incremental methodology for implementing MOSA based on lessons learned in execution of MOSA and current proactive MOSA initiatives. The methodology includes a compliance assessment of MOSA application, integration of capability and technology planning roadmaps, comparative assessment of legacy and emerging open/key standards, and factoring emerging key interfaces into proactive MOSA based planning. Any architecture by definition includes a set of hardware and software components, hardware and software standards, and a topology instance. Typical MOSA architecture work products generated in this regard include a MOSA Plan, a Platform Technology Insertion Plan, Platform/Technology Planning Roadmaps, and an End-Of-Life (EOL) Management Plan. Relative to architecture, the commercial world continues to introduce next generation hardware components, software components, and standards at a very rapid rate. A key MOSA driver is to organize an infrastructure of key interfaces for establishing sustainable modularity, standards, and interoperability to enable programs to make balanced architecture decisions. This MOSA implementation has been successfully applied on the Navy Multi-Mission Helicopter (MMH) program. Optimizing MOSA in avionics systems is a continuous program commitment from both a customer and supplier perspective. Additional MOSA optimization opportunities are continuously emerging including initiatives like the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE). The objective of FACE is to guide current MOSA platforms toward a more unified next generation processing environment with additional improvements in open, modular, portable, partitioned, expandable, secure, and interoperable platform architectures. Additional drivers include the need for improvements in platform information assurance, tamper resistant and trusted computing, affordability in incorporating advanced program capabilities, and support of 3rd party rapid capability insertion. Proactive MOSA optimization focus and proactive engagement in initiatives like FACE are critical to future platform affordability and sustainability in balanced architecture solutions. © 2012 IEEE.","","Digital avionics; Hardware; Optimization; Regulatory compliance; Standards; Sustainable development; Additional costs; Application softwares; Architecture decisions; Avionics systems; Comparative assessment; Design method; End-of-life; Hardware and software; Hardware and software components; Hardware components; Hardware development; Incremental improvements; Incremental methodology; Information assurance; Interface standards; Management plans; Multimission helicopters; Platform architecture; Platform technology; Processing environments; Rapid rate; Reference architecture; Road-maps; Software component; System approach; Systems approach; Tamper resistant; Technical view; Technology planning; Trusted computing; Work products; Open systems"

MILS ensures mutual independence and prevents the spread of the error effectively between partitions. However, in some specific applications, there exists enormous amount of information interaction and sharing between partitions, the process of which has the problem of potential sensitive information leakage and tamper. From the point of view of information flow control, the article puts forward a model and method of security information flow control strictly between MILS partitions based on trusted computing. At first, we designed a lattice-based multi-level policy and a downgrading policy. The two policies not only automatically make the indirect information flow secure, but also break the traditional BLP model curt rules ""not read up, not write down"", which meet the needs of the security level of subjects and objects with the changes of task requirements in MILS. On this basis, a complete information flow control mechanism is established. By detailed analysis and verification, our information security flow security control method can effectively ensure that the information flow between partitions are all legitimate news after authorized by Separation Kernel and filtered by credible components, which can efficaciously protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. © 2012 IEEE.","information flow control; MILS; security policy","Artificial intelligence; Flow control; Amount of information; Analysis and verifications; BLP model; Complete information; Downgrading policies; Information flow control; Information flows; Information sharing; Lattice-based; MILS; Multiple independent levels of securities; Mutual independence; Point of views; Security controls; Security level; Security policy; Sensitive informations; Trusted computing; Network security"

Th paper explores the goals, objectives and deployment aspects of field solutions that are aimed at data retrieval, analysis and decision support for operators. The goals of utilizing IED data are in general driven by the cost benefit in utilizing more data and better information to improve reliability, quality of service, personnel productivity, regulatory compliance, and utilization of assets. The objectives are to develop such solutions through seamless integration with legacy solutions hence assuring continuity of existing and introduction of new practices. Hence the deployment approaches have to be based on interoperability and open platform solutions that assure upgradability, testability and amenability to global standard adoption while meeting the cybersecurity requirements. To illustrate different requirements for data retrieval and analysis, as well as different aspect of the operational uses, several applications are explored: cause-effect analysis of protective relay operation, optimization of fault location calculation, intelligent alarm processing, and utilization of the field data for troubleshooting tests. For each application an example of how the data processing may be implemented is given and improvements criteria are established. To illustrate the best practices this paper starts with discussion of new requirements for such solutions. In all instances the end users have to be identified and their needs have to be clearly articulated through development of well-structured use case scenarios. After the approaches to the deployment specification are discussed, the paper illustrates various implementations undertaken by several utilities. For each case the applications of interest are outlined, specific deployment scenarios are explained, and expected benefits are summarized.

With the rapid development of the power grid, higher demands for security and safety have been messioned and production management of transmission and distribution equipment still face many challenges. The large UHV power network structure characterized by large capacity, long distance, west-to-east power transmission and north-to-south power transmission in China has placed more new stringent requirements on the capability of operation, maintenance and control of power transmission and transformation equipments. Moreover, the west-to-east power transmission channels exhibit noticeable micro-topography and micro-meteorology characteristics and the extreme climate such as coating of ice and snow on lines, strong thunderstorm and squall line wind occur more frequently, posing more risks on the safe operation of the equipments. Following the State Grid's strategic objective of building a strong smart grid, North China Grid Company built a smart transmission grid analysis-control system. During the process of system construction, many techniques such as internet of things, virtual earth, multi-information fusion, communications, information security, equipment analysis and diagnosis and on-site intelligent control have been used. Through this system, equipment status can be observed, the production process can be monitored, and the operational risk can be early warned. The smart transmission grid analysis control system is based on EAM system and supported by GIS. and condition monitoring system. It enables panoramic information interaction, asset performance analysis and intensive field control. With elaborate technical architecture, standard interface specification, modular functional configuration and integrated open platform, the system can provide effecient services for senior executives in dispatching center, production department, science & research institutes and functional units, achieving the goal that equipment state can be observed, production process can be monitored and operation risks can be alarmed in advance. Now this system has already become an enterprise-class, integrated and open platform for condition monitoring for North China Grid Company. It has been used in works of accident rehearsal, daily operation and maintenance, failure analysis and emergency repair. Remarkable economic and social benefits have been achieved by using this system. The development and application of smart transmission grid analysis-control system have comprehensively promoted lean production management, refined cost control, streamlined operation processes and stipulation of a series of working standards. The system provides a full-scale information to the executives, enables panoramic information display to the dispatchers, provides decision and technical support to the production and research departments as well as equipment control of the basic functional units. This system is helpful for our company to make a transfer of the production management from digitalization and visualization to intelligent control.","Analysis-and-management; Condition-monitoring; Multivariate-information-fusion; Smart-grid; Three-dimension-holography-remote-diagnose; Transmission-and-distribution-equipment","Condition monitoring; Control systems; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Industrial management; Industry; Intelligent control; Interface states; Power transmission; Production engineering; Security of data; Thunderstorms; Analysis-and-management; Multivariate-information-fusion; Smart-grid; Three-dimension-holography-remote-diagnose; Transmission-and-distribution-equipment; Construction equipment"

Thus, detecting information leakage on Android is in urgent need. However, till now, there is still no complete vetting process applied to Android markets. State-of-the-art approaches for detecting Android information leakage apply dynamic analysis on user site, thus they introduce large runtime overhead to the Android apps. This paper proposes a new approach called Leak Miner, which detects leakage of sensitive information on Android with static taint analysis. Unlike dynamic approaches, Leak Miner analyzes Android apps on market site. Thus, it does not introduce runtime overhead to normal execution of target apps. Besides, Leak Miner can detect information leakage before apps are distributed to users, so malicious apps can be removed from market before users download them. Our evaluation result shows that Leak Miner can detect 145 true information leakages inside a 1750 app set. © 2012 IEEE.","Information security; Mobile computing","Commerce; Miners; Mobile computing; Security of data; Software engineering; Android applications; Android apps; Android markets; Android platforms; Distribution centers; Dynamic approaches; Evaluation results; Information leakage; New approaches; Personal information; Runtime overheads; Sensitive informations; SMS messages; State-of-the-art approach; Robots"

So, we can use multiple natural language processing techniques at the same time. According to this approach, we propose general embedding/extracting algorithms and develop a hybrid natural language information hiding (HYNLIH) system.

Teaching of the certain fields of security is strategic due to countries' geographical location, local business or cultural and social aspects. The European Union countries are currently missing some kind of online public database, which would cover the security and safety field and bring together students, researchers and experts interested in the subject. The main aim of the preparation of portal ""eSEC - Competency Based eportal of Security and Safety Engineering"" (eSEC-portal), is to establish a web system, which would serve as a new tool in the process of learning, for both students and professionals, in fields of security studies, safety studies and crisis management. One of the challenges, while establishing the web portal, was to analyse the conditions of teaching security and safety in the selected EU countries. That is why the first part of this paper focuses on current educational situation in the Czech Republic representing an EU member, however, it is above all intended for international audience such as students and teachers outside the Czech Republic. The second part introduces a qualitative SWOT analysis of education in security and safety and connection with services, which will be offered by the prepared eSEC-portal. The third part predicts and quantitatively analyses the profiles of potential future eSEC-portal users together with their possible requirements. Users are split into several groups such as students, pedagogues, scientists and experts. The analysis discusses the user requirements for content, interactivity, user-friendly extremity and graphical surroundings of eSEC-portaĺs modules, all in the connection to their already existing ICT skills. Input data have been collected through on-line questionnaires and the sample has been represented by 144 respondents. The results of this user requirements analysis, enriched with similar data gathered in another five EU countries have been fundamental for functional design and final content of the eSEC-portal. The certain limitation of the study lies in the research sample, which consists mainly of respondents who are familiar with the Information security area. Conclusion discusses the other challenge for eSEC-portal developers and maintainers which is in keeping the portal alive.","Security safety education elearning web portal eSEC","Economic and social effects; Portals; Safety engineering; Security of data; Social aspects; Surveys; Crisis management; Czech Republic; EU countries; European Union countries; Functional design; Geographical locations; In-field; Information security area; Input datas; Interactivity; Local business; On currents; Online questionnaire; Public database; Safety education; Safety studies; Security studies; SWOT analysis; User requirements; Web system; Students"

Attacks range from sending millions of requests to a server in an attempt to slow it down, flooding a server with large packets of invalid data, to sending requests with an invalid or spoofed IP address. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. Sequential Pattern Mining is to discover the frequent sequential pattern in the sequential event dataset. Intrusion detection using sequential pattern mining is a research focusing on the field of information security. In this paper, we have implemented Apriori a candidate generation algorithm and PrefixSpan a pattern growth algorithm on a network intrusion dataset from KDD Cup 1999, 10 percent of training dataset, which is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, the leading professional organization of data miners. To address the absence of timestamp in the dataset, we considered two approaches to generate the sequence database from the dataset. One is by taking service as reference attribute and the other one by taking a timestamp window of size one day (86400 seconds). We found that experimental results of PrefixSpan for predicting DoS attacks sequences on KDD cup 99 training dataset are efficient. These results are then compared with SPAM (Sequential Pattern Mining) algorithm which uses vertical bitmap data layout allowing for simple, efficient counting. © 2012 IEEE.","Data mining; DoS attacks; fuzzy sets; intrusion detection system; sequence data; time interval","Algorithms; Communication; Data mining; Fuzzy sets; Intrusion detection; Apriori; Broad application; Candidate generation; Data miners; Data mining and knowledge discovery; Data mining problems; Data sets; Denial of service attacks; DoS attacks; Frequent sequential patterns; Intrusion Detection Systems; IP addresss; Knowledge discovery and data minings; Network intrusions; Networking structure; Pattern growth; PrefixSpan; Professional organization; Sequence data; Sequence database; Sequential-pattern mining; Special interest groups; Time interval; Time-stamp; Training dataset; Vertical bitmap; Computer crime"

Typically, systems use one or two of the following factors to authenticate end-users: what you know (e.g., password), what you have (e.g., RSA ID), or what you are (e.g., fingerprint). Systems based on these factors have the following limitations: 1) access is typically bound to a single authentication occurrence leading to remote vulnerabilities, 2) the factors have little impact against persistent insider threats, and 3) many of the authentication systems violate system design principles such as user psychological acceptability by inconveniencing the end-users. In order to mitigate the identified limitations, we propose the usage of 'where you are' as a complementary factor that can significantly improve both cybersecurity and physical security. Having accurate location tracking as a new factor for authentication: 1) provides continuous identification tracking and continuous mediation of access to resources, 2) requires remote threats to acquire a physical presence, 3) allows for the enforcement of cybersecurity and physical security policies in real-time through automation, and 4) provides enhanced security without inconveniencing the end-users. Using the strength of location as an authentication factor, this paper specifies design requirements that must be present in an insider-threat Prevention System (iTPS) that is capable of actively monitoring malicious insider behaviors. iTPS has the potential to radically change the physical protection systems and cybersecurity landscape by providing practitioners with the first-of-its-kind tool for real-time insider-threat prevention capabilities. iTPS is particularly suited to address the safety and security needs of critical infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and emergency response situations. © 2012 IEEE.","","Access to resources; Accurate location; Authentication systems; Continuous identification; Cyber security; Design Principles; Design requirements; Emergency response; End-users; Insider attack; Insider Threat; Malicious insiders; Nuclear facilities; Physical protection systems; Physical security; Prevention systems; Authentication"

In order to study the leakage threshold and the shielding performance for information leakage, the notions of Information Identifying Degree, Information Resolution Threshold and Computer Security Defence Distance are formalized respectively. Then, Information Identifying Degree, Information Resolution Threshold and Computer Security Defence Distance are analyzed. So, the strength of information leakage is quantitatively assessed under different shielding levels and distance. The simulation results show that FCC and MIL461C standards are not suitable for the evaluation of information leakage and even strictly standard should be considered. At last, new shielding levels of information leakage are marked off and the shielding effects are assessed by using Information Resolution Threshold.

While the decision to outsource the security operations of an organization may seem counterintuitive, there are potential benefits from joining an MSSP network that include pooling of risk and access to more security-enabling resources and expertise. We examine structural results explaining the reasons firms join an MSSP network, and characterize the growth of MSSP network size under different forms of ownership (monopoly versus consortium). We find that the need for an initial investment in MSSP networks (which is necessary to overcome the stalling effect) only affects the optimal network size for a consortium but has no impact on the optimal network size for a profit-maximizing monopolist. Our results provide an explanation why the majority of the MSSPs are for-profit entities and consortium-based MSSPs are less common. Such a market structure can be attributed to the potential for larger size by the for-profit MSSP owner combined with beneficial pricing structure and a lack of growth uncertainty for the early clients.","Information security; Managed security services; Network effects; Network growth; Network ownership structure; Outsourcing","Economics; Industry; Optimization; Outsourcing; Security of data; Economic perspective; Managed security; Managed security service providers; Market structures; Network effects; Network growth; Network size; Optimal networks; Outsource; Ownership structure; Potential benefits; Pricing structures; Security operations; Profitability"

Considering this property, an implementation of image encryption scheme based on the quantum logistic map is proposed. The security and performance analysis of the proposed image encryption is performed using well-known methods. The results of the reliability analysis are encouraging and it can be concluded that, the proposed scheme is efficient and secure.

As a result, efficiency of a company's governance mechanism is enhanced, and the performance management is also improved, which all bring benefits to the corporate governance. Thus we need to seize new opportunities of corporate governance reform brought by development of the information technology, and use it to manage the company rationally.

A combination of these two can eliminate their individual shortcomings, such as non-revocability, non-diversity, and privacy issues in biometrics and need of strong authentication in cryptography. Crypto-biometric systems combine techniques from biometrics and cryptography for these purposes, and more interestingly, to obtain biometrics based cryptographic keys. In this paper, we address the problem of sharing these keys. We propose a crypto-biometric scheme in which two clients can share a session key securely and establish a secure communication session. The scheme involves a Central Authority for Registration and Authentication (CARA) with which the clients are registered. The CARA stores biometric data only in transformed, cancelable form, allowing for easy revocation of the templates and protecting privacy. There are two distinctive features of this protocol (1) it achieves mutual authentication and starts secure communication between two clients which may be previously unknown to each other, and (2) this protocol works even if the two clients use different biometric modalities in the same (as well as in different) session. © 2012 Gesellschaft fr Informatik.","","Authentication; Communication; Cryptography; Security of data; Biometric data; Crypto-biometric systems; Cryptographic key; High potential; Mutual authentication; Privacy issue; Secure communications; Session key; Strong authentication; Biometrics"

In our eavesdropping scenario, receiver system is in a building and the target display is in another building. These experiments show that 26 points and bigger fonts can be read easily from the reconstructed images which are captured from the target display approximately 50 meters away.

There is currently no international standard formalising the digital forensic investigation process, nor does a harmonised digital forensic investigation process exist that is acceptable in this field. This paper proposes a harmonised digital forensic investigation process model. The proposed model is an iterative and multi-tier model. The authors introduce the term ""parallel actions"", defined as the principles which should be translated into actions within the digital forensic investigation process (i.e. principle that evidence's integrity must be preserved through the process and that chain of evidence must be preserved). The authors believe that the proposed model is comprehensive and that it harmonises existing state-of-the-art digital forensic investigation process models. Furthermore, we believe that the proposed model can lead to the standardisation of the digital forensic investigation process. © 2012 IEEE.","digital forensics; information systems security; model; process","Information technology; Models; Security of data; Chain of evidence; Digital forensic; Information systems security; International standards; Multi-tier model; Parallel actions; process; Time-periods; Electronic crime countermeasures"

In this framework, there is also a need to provide fault tolerance mechanism to ensure reliability of the server and also scalability feature is incorporated to cater for growing number of users. The main component of the framework is the 'vTPM Manager' module which resides in the remote TPM server. This vTPM Manager handles the creation and deletion of virtual TPMs, providing fault tolerance mechanism and also scalability feature for the whole system. By using this framework, users who do not have a TPM residing in their device would be able to remotely access the TPM server to utilize the TPM functionalities with the assurance of a fault tolerance mechanism and the number of users is unlimited since it is scalable. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media.","Fault-tolerance; Migration; Scalability; TPM instances; Virtual TPM; vTPM Manager","Computer science; Computer simulation; Management; Managers; Scalability; Security of data; Fault tolerance mechanisms; Migration; Remote servers; TPM instances; Trusted platform module; Virtual machines; Virtual TPM; Fault tolerance"

First, the author discovered that several methods such as contracts, audits and standards were applied to balance power relationships between organizations or transfer responsibilities to other parties. The objectives of these methods are different within organizations. Second, the paper presents a comprehensive view of different security and continuity solutions in interorganizational IT relationships. The findings have practical value for IT managers and information security experts. The interviews were conducted in different organizations. Therefore, it is suggested that a single in-depth study that examines the phenomenon on different organizational levels within one organization would supplement the findings. Further studies on the power, trust and control balance of interorganizational IT relationships are required. This paper builds on and expands information security and business continuity literature by illustrating that audits and standards play different roles in interorganizational IT relationships within organizations, and that contracts form the basis of those relationships. Information security problems and business continuity breaches caused by external partners and outsourcing vendors affect the reputation and value of the client company. Therefore, managers must have the means to ensure the continuity of operations. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business continuity; Business continuity management; Data security; Finland; Information security management; Information technology; Interorganizational IT relationships; Interorganizational systems; Outsourcing; Software as a service","Information management; Managers; Outsourcing; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Business continuity; Business continuity management; Finland; Information security managements; Inter-organizational systems; Interorganizational IT relationships; Software as a service; Information technology"

This architecture introduces information security challenges that are not comprehensively addressed by current best-practices. This paper evaluates if an Information Security Management System (ISMS), defined by the international standard ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 can be used to comprehensively support Information Security governance for SOA. As SOA governance, a separate and distinct governance framework, also addresses information security to a certain extent, managers are faced the difficult task of deciding whether their SOA sufficiently protected by the different frameworks. The conclusion is that information security for SOA needs to be addressed more holistically, following an Enterprise Information Security Architecture (EISA) approach where Enterprise Architecture (EA) is concerned with the design of the overall architectural vision of an organization. The framework chosen for this purpose is SABSA, a well-known enterprise security architecture. Using the example of access control to highlight challenges, it becomes clear that Information Security governance for SOA can benefit from an approach such as SABSA. © 2012 IEEE.","governance; ISMS; SABSA; SOA","Access control; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Business Process; Design paradigm; Enterprise Architecture; Enterprise security; governance; Information security architecture; Information security governance; Information security management systems; International standards; ISMS; ISO/IEC; SABSA; SOA; SOA governance; Information management"

In the proposed method, moving object detection and segmentation is performed first, thus location information of the objects can be directly extracted from the H.264 bitstream. Then object regions and background in the surveillance video are encrypted unequally. The bits with the highest sensitivity in the macroblocks covering the object region are thoroughly encrypted while those in the background macroblocks are selectively encrypted. Experimental results have shown that the proposed object-based unequal encryption method is able to effectively ensure the security of surveillance scenes, while the required complexity is low. Furthermore, object detection and encryption are entirely operated in the compressed domain and the output encrypted bitstream remains format-compliant with H.264 standard and the compression ratio can also be maintained. © 2012 IEEE.","compressed domain; H.264; Object-based encryption","Compression ratio (machinery); Monitoring; Object recognition; Security of data; Security systems; Signal processing; Bit stream; Compressed domain; Encryption methods; Format-compliant; H.264; H.264 standards; Location information; Macro block; Moving-object detection; Multimedia information; Object based; Object Detection; Object region; Surveillance video; Cryptography"

When WSNs deployed in remote locations need to be reprogrammed, environmental conditions often make it impossible to physically retrieve them. Over the Air Programming (OAP) plays an important role in achieving this task. Additionally remote management of the WSN is crucial as it allows the user to monitor the download process. Cybersecurity of the WSN helps to ensure that the communication is properly authenticated. Several platform dependent protocols have been developed for OAP including Deluge and MOAP. Due to the restrictions of these platform-dependent protocols, any modifications to the hardware require modifications to the underlying protocol. For example, using OAP for iMote2 sensors requires porting Deluge from an existing hardware. We present the many challenges that we faced in making OAP possible on an iMote2 sensor network platform, including changes and upgrades to: file system management, Java toolbase and GUI implementation, reboot mechanism, robustness and boot loader. The performance of our OAP on the iMote2 platform is evaluated using a real sensor network along the completion time, overhead, and robustness dimensions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Cybersecurity; iMote2; Remote programming; Wireless sensor networks",""

These components facilitate novel techniques to infer possible routes of attacks and generate attack graphs based on attackers' motivation, objectives, capabilities, and available modes of entry and to use this inferred knowledge to simulate attacks on an organization's modeled infrastructure.

As Area-Of-Interest (AOI) defines each player's interests, an entity normally maintains a subscriber list of players whose AOIs cover the position of the entity. To maintain the subscriber list, players are required to send AOI updates. Unfortunately, AOI update is vulnerable to information exposure (IE) attack especially on P2P infrastructure. Sensitive information, such as player's position, can be revealed during AOI update without owner's authorization and attention. This eventually results in an unfair game. In this paper, we demonstrate that such IE attack on MMOG can help cheaters gain unauthorized benefits. Notably, we present a Monte Carlo based simulator to quantitatively measure the impact of IE attack when different IM schemes are applied. Three P2P schemes are assessed and a Client/Server scheme is also employed for comparison. In addition, we also evaluate IE attack when a group of players collude with each other to share information. Experimental data obtained from simulation are analyzed and explained.

In this paper, we will propose an image high capacity and reversible data hiding scheme based on the frequency of block pixels. This method explores the frequency of pixels in each block and uses them as the predictive values. Because the neighboring pixels of blocks have the similar characteristics and the differences of prediction pixels are approximately.

Hence, the process of identification, analysis, and mitigation of Information Security risks has assumed utmost importance. This paper presents a quantitative information security risk analysis methodology for enterprises. The proposed methodology incorporates two approaches. Consolidated approach identifies risk as a single value for each asset. Detailed approach identifies the threat-vulnerability pair responsible for a risk and computes a risk factor corresponding to each security property for every asset. The assets are classified into three different risk zones namely high, medium and low risk zone. For high-risk assets, management may install high cost infrastructure to safeguard an asset; for medium-risk assets, management may apply security policies, guidelines and procedures; management may decide not to invest anything for assets at low-risk.

At the same time this interconnectivity exposes the organization to many internal (employees) and external threats. Internal threat is among the top information security issues facing organizations as the human factor is regarded the weakest link in the security chain. To address this ""human factor"" researchers have suggested the fostering of an information security culture to address the human behavior so that information security becomes a second nature to employees. An important step in the fostering of an information security culture is the assessment of the current state of the culture.

However, these security mechanisms typically reduce the work efficiency of the staff by making them spend time working on non-project related tasks. It is therefore of business importance to determine the total amount of loss in efficiency and productivity and the factors that impact this reduction in productivity. In this study, the loss of efficiency was quantified using the concept of non-productive time (NPT). The total amount of NPT associated with EDRM is related to the business process and human behavior of the employees, for example, the documentation classification system, average response time from system administrators, and percentage of failures in opening authorized documents. Parameters that define the business model of the corporation quantitatively and have an impact on NPT are identified and potential data collection techniques for these parameters are also proposed. A Petri-net model is built to simulate the business process of implementing an EDRM product. The sensitivity of NPT associated with the EDRM product to these parameters was evaluated using this Petri-net model. The parameters are ranked according to their relative importance. This study has the potential to help information security managers to make informed security investment decisions and to take actions toward reducing the impact of EDRM, so that a balance is kept between information security expense, resource drain and effectiveness of security products. © 2012 IEEE.","Access control; Non-productive time; Password; Security investment; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic modeling","Access control; Copyrights; Efficiency; Information retrieval systems; Investments; Productivity; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic models; Business models; Business Process; Classification system; Data collection; Digital Documents; Digital information security; Digital Rights Management; Human behaviors; Non-productive time; Password; Resource drain; Security investments; Security mechanism; Security products; System administrators; Work efficiency; Industry"

Nowadays, cryptography and network security is a hot topic for communication and computer industry. Currently, encryption technique in the information security mainly contains conventional private key encryption system and public key encryption system, the former has low computation overhead, but its encryption strength is not high; the latter, although has high encryption strength, its computation cost is huge. Therefore, it has profound theoretical significance and wide application prospects to research a sort of information encryption algorithms and information security software system with security, good confidentiality and high calculation speed. Chaos phenomenon is a determinacy process which is similar to random, and often appears in nonlinear dynamical system, this process is neither periodic nor convergent, and is sensitively dependent on initial value [1-3]. These basic features of chaotic system can just meet the basic requirements of secret communication and cryptology. The researches of Secret communication, information encryption and information hiding technology are based on chaos theory, and have become one of popular and frontier topics developed by the cross fields of international nonlinear science and information science.

While some people naturally accept their responsibilities, others require encouragement to stay on the right path. One potential factor is the desire to avoid feeling shamed by managers or peers. Mark Harris and Steven Furnell examine the potential of shaming as a means of dissuading employees from breaching policy, using original research. The results reveal that shaming could indeed have a positive influence, but there are also potential risks involved. It is widely recognised that security cannot succeed through technology alone and therefore won't work unless people are on board. Many organisations consequently face the questions of how to get staff to understand their roles when it comes to security, and then to enact their security responsibilities. This, of course, presents them with a situation for which there are multiple right answers, as well as several techniques that are less likely to be successful in some contexts. As such, it is worth understanding the techniques that are likely to have value. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","","Computer crime; Computer science; Potential risks; Security compliance; Security of data"

Cryptography has come up as a solution which plays a vital role in information security system against malicious attacks. This security system uses some algorithms to scramble data into scribbled text which can be only being decoded or decrypted by party those possesses the associated key. These algorithms consume a significant amount of computing resources such as CPU time, memory and computation time. In this paper a most widely used symmetric encryption techniques i.e. advanced encryption standard (AES) have been implemented using MATLAB software. After the implementing this encryption technique, analysis is done by using a parameter called Avalanche effect. Plaintext and encryption key are mapped in binary code before encryption process. Avalanche Effect is calculated by changing one bit in plaintext keeping the key constant and by changing one bit in encryption key keeping the key constant, Experimental results shows that the proposed algorithm exhibit significant high Avalanche Effect which improves the level of the security. © 2012 IEEE.","Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); Avalanche Effect; Ciphertext; Secret key","Algorithms; Binary codes; Communication; Data privacy; Electronic data interchange; MATLAB; Network security; Security systems; Advanced Encryption Standard; Avalanche effects; Ciphertexts; Computation time; Computing resource; CPU time; Data storage; Encryption key; Encryption technique; Malicious attack; Matlab- software; Plaintext; Secret key; Symmetric encryption; Cryptography"

Any cryptographic scheme that reveals private keys will soon have its security absolutely disintegrate. For example, in digital signature systems, anyone who obtains the victim's private key, authenticity and non-repudiation can no longer be claimed or proven. Because the private key is a long random bit string and should be stored securely, some special cryptographic hardware such as an IC (Integrated Circuit) card is needed to store and protect the private key. Unfortunately, the security of private keys solely depends on the vulnerable passwords. This study proposes combining a neural network technique and password keystroke features to dynamically generate a long-lived private key rather than statically stored in a storage unit. Compared with other traditional methods, even if the storage unit is lost or the password is revealed, the probability of exposing the private key is reduced. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Most cryptographic hash functions have been based on the Merkle-Damgård construction, which converts a message with an arbitrary length into a fixed-length hash digest. The problem with the Merkle-Damgård construction is its computation time, which increases gradually as the input size increases when the processes run sequentially. In this paper, we proposed an alternative construction to reduce the computation time and improve the overall hashing efficiency. The proposed method is the Multi-Pipeline Hash Construction (MPHC), which presents overlapping execution between independent block functions. The MPHC runs in parallel on multi-core machines and enhances the hashing performance in terms of speedup and efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the MPHC performs better than the Merkle-Damgård construction, and the security analysis proves that the MPHC produces better-quality hash digests than the Merkle-Damgård construction in terms of the randomness of the digest value. © 2012 ICIC International.","Hash function; Merkle-Damgård construction; Multi-pipeline hash construction (MPHC); Secure hash algorithm (SHA); Speedup","Hash functions; Security of data; Computation time; Cryptographic hash functions; Data integrity; Hashing functions; Input size; Message authentication; Multi-core machines; Multi-pipeline hash construction (MPHC); Secure hash algorithm; Security analysis; Speedup; Pipelines"

Disciplines and their business integration in a multifaceted organizational environment are considered here from both the practical viewpoints and theoretical foundation of scientific philosophy. These disciplines are handled in various international management system standards for directing and guiding the development of organizational practices. Information security management is one of the disciplines that has become significant or even crucial in the most organizations of business and social communities. The ISO/IEC 27001 standard specifies general requirements for it. In this paper, the authors take a stance on this standard and its applications, reveal problems from the standards' user's point of view, and present experienced solutions that could be applied for the needs of any kind of organization. This paper provides a comprehensive manner with many different and practically relevant viewpoints to apply the ISO/IEC 27001 standard creatively and integrate it with other managerial disciplines and the processes of management of an organization. This is a new approach differing from traditional isolated and strictly formalized implementations of the information security management systems. Also the harmonization of the different management system standards is a new effort in standardization. Challenges of the modern business environments have been discussed. Information security management is considered from an organization's overall business performance point of view, and in this context a practical focus is on evaluations and systemic performance transformations. Business leaders' crucial role is justified, and managing situations are analyzed and new attitudes proposed.

Students in a cybersecurity curriculum need to access and learn about topics in cybersecurity such that they have a clear understanding of the sophistication of threats such that they can implement mitigation response. Development of hands on curriculum in cybersecurity therefore poses significant challenges to the information technology infrastructure in an instructional environment. Among the various challenges one of the significant challenges involves attack simulations of a cyber-attack requiring the creation of a walled infrastructure to accommodate the equipment where computing services are hosted. The challenges of containing malicious software which can be released by accident are also significant to the IT infrastructure. In this paper we show how the walled infrastructure with computing service can be created such that cybersecurity curriculum can be institutionalized where students locally and remotely can access this infrastructure. The walled IT infrastructure is based on risk escalation wherein connectivity and access to computing resources is contained as risk to computing infrastructure increases. We also show IT challenges in curriculum development on topics of hardware, software and networking for cybersecurity and how virtualization is a means for solving the challenges in those respective topics.

In this paper we show how to extend the widely popular high school-level Oracle Academy program with security concepts. The proposed curriculum extensions require minimal changes to the current curriculum while introducing students to the security threats in database systems. We provide example database laboratory materials that can be included in a high school database or computer science course. We show that security concepts can be presented to the students even at this early stage of their education.

This has led to an increased need for information security management to safeguard against loss/alteration or theft of the firm's important information. SMEs tend to be concerned with vulnerabilities from external threats, although industry research suggests that a substantial proportion of security incidents originate from insiders within the firm. Hence, physical preventative measures such as antivirus software and firewalls are proving to solve only part of the problem as the employees controlling them do not have adequate information security knowledge. This tends to expose the firm to costly mistakes that can be made by naïve/uninformed employees. This paper presents an information security awareness process that seeks to cultivate positive security behaviours using the behavioural intentions models i.e. the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Protection Motivation Theory.

Most web applications today are susceptible to attacks ranging from unauthorized access, movement, alteration or deletion of files, virus attacks, and thefts of data. The use of perimeter defenses like firewalls, anti-viruses and the likes are insufficient. Because of this, industries are seeking for more comprehensive security measures that can be incorporated in their web applications. An inclusion of defense which will evidently reduce vulnerabilities in web applications is seen to be in the development lifecycle of the application itself. Developers need to learn and examine the vulnerabilities that could possibly occur in web applications so that precautionary measures can be adopted in the implementation stage.

Previous studies have not emphasized information security management issues. Medical organizations particularly have always neglected information security management issues. Information security issues can severely affect the quality of medical care, as well as the reputation and sustainable development of medical organizations. Thus, the primary purpose of this study is to assess the level of attention provided to information security management by medical personnel in Taiwan. This study developed an evaluation framework based on the ISO27001 standard for information security management, and surveyed personnel from two medical organizations in Taiwan. Risk priority numbers (RPNs) were used to assess the level of attention provided to information security management by medical personnel in Taiwan. The results indicate that information technology (IT) personnel pay great attention to information security management, whereas most executives have no technological knowledge. General staff have minimal technological knowledge and do not pay much attention to information security. These results mean that information security management cannot be fully implemented. © 2012 ICIC International.","Information security management; ISO27001; Medical staff; Risk priority number (RPN)","Industrial management; Information technology; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Evaluation framework; Evaluation models; Information security managements; ISO27001; Medical personnel; Medical staff; Risk Priority Number; Sustainable growth; Technological knowledge; Human resource management"

UWASN can be applicable to many fields such as underwater monitoring, underwater resource exploration, ocean data collection, and military purposes. Existing terrestrial wireless sensor network security mechanisms have not been applied to UWASNs due to interference such as multipath propagation, signal fading, limited bandwidth, slow data rates, and long transmission delays. UWASNs also require security mechanisms and algorithms to maintain data confidentiality and integrity. Security-related research is being actively conducted, but it is still in its nascent stages. Therefore, when considering a UWASN protocol stack, the application layer, when sending data to its sub-layer, needs to encrypt the payload for information security.

We associate a security level with each place, and restrict each place to store only data appropriate for that security level. When places interact only with other places at the same security level, then our security mechanisms impose no restrictions. When places of differing security levels interact, our information security analysis prevents potentially dangerous information flows, including information flow through covert scheduling channels. The X10 concurrency mechanisms simplify reasoning about information flow in concurrent programs. We present a static analysis that enforces a noninterference- based extensional information security condition in a calculus that captures the key aspects of X10's place abstraction and async-finish parallelism. We extend this security analysis to support many of X10's language features, and have implemented a prototype compiler for the resulting language.","Language-based security; information-flow control; X10.","Computer programming languages; Concurrency control; Flow control; Object oriented programming; Security of data; Security systems; Coarse-grained; Concurrent languages; Concurrent program; Concurrent programming languages; Information flow control; Information flows; Language features; Security analysis; Security level; Security mechanism; Static analysis"

Findings - The authors discovered that staff often felt subjugated by policies, they experienced a lack of support, and experienced pressure to comply and to motivate the staff they managed to comply with policy directives. It was also obvious that all interviewees were highly motivated and concerned about information security. The authors conclude by proposing some mediation: a recognition and reward scheme to reward secure behaviour, the implementation of an incident response process, facilitated upward communication and development of a security culture in the organisation. Finally, the authors argue for the same rules to apply to all staff, so that procedures are fair, and seen to be so. Practical implications - The authors make some recommendations for mediation, which should ensure that employees experience less pressure in complying with policy directives.

Toward this end, we build a system dynamics model using the Norwegian Oil and Gas Industry as the context. The Norwegian Oil and Gas Industry has started to adopt new information communication technology to connect its offshore platforms, onshore control centers, and suppliers. In oil companies, the management is generally aware of the increasing risks associated with operational transition; however, to date, investment in incident response capability has not been highly prioritized because of the uncertainty related to risks and the present reactive mental model of security risk management.

M-banking is thus become more convenient, effective and timely through the new mobile communication systems. In order to raise the security of M-banking, some banks adopt the one-time password (OTP) to remedy the possible M-banking stealing risk. In the past, the OTP is sent to personal mobile phone. But, currently most of the smart mobile phone can performing M-banking easily. Thus, it gains higher risk of information security due to mobile phone hacking. In order to provide a reliable and secure M-banking process without decrease the convenience concurrently, in the paper one-time password (OTP) and personal biometric have been combined with personal identification and password for verification while M-banking. As the client side initiates a request for M-banking to the server side of a bank that provides M-banking service, the server side will generate an OTP with limited period for registration the M-banking and transmit to the client side. After receiving the OTP message, the client side must verify if the OTP message is validation and provided by the desired real server side. After then, the client side will register the on-line M-banking with the OTP in the specified short period. After receiving the service request, the server side will then request the client side to capture personal biometric such as fingerprint, iris, photo, and etc. immediately for further verification with the existed data stored in the server side to prevent the M-banking embezzling. If the personal biometric has been verified as an old one, the M-banking will immediately terminated by the server side. As the verification is finally done by the server side, the client side then can perform transaction via M-banking smoothly. The proposed scheme not only can provide secure M-banking, but also can clearly define the process. Therefore, if there are any M-banking arguments occurred due to Internet hacking or mobile phone stealing for M-banking, both of the server side and client side could protect their rights and interests. © 2012 IEEE.","biometrics; information security; mobile banking; one time password","Authentication; Biometrics; Cellular telephone systems; Computer crime; Global system for mobile communications; Intelligent computing; Mobile phones; Personal computers; Personal computing; Radio broadcasting; Security of data; Smartphones; Biometric verification; If there are; M-banking; Mobile bankings; Mobile e-commerce; One time passwords; Personal identification; Service requests; Short periods; Tablet PCs; Network security"

Fuzzy vault is a widely used scheme binding biometric data and cryptography effectively. However, there are some drawbacks in the existing fuzzy vault scheme. The number of matching-minutiae is determined by the length of the key, and time complexity in coefficient reconstruction is high. To resolve these problems, firstly, we proposed a new fuzzy fingerprint vault scheme, in which the number of variables is determined by the required number of matching-minutiae. Then, fingerprint minutiae are used as the seed of Lorenz Chaotic System to obtain a set of random data. A new key deprived from the random data is bound with the key in cryptographic. Last, the bound data is protected by the chaff points, which is also generated by the Lorenz Chaotic System.

However, most existing SSO schemes have not been formally proved to satisfy credential privacy and soundness of credential based authentication. To overcome this drawback, we formalise the security model of single sign-on scheme with authenticated key exchange. Specially, we point out the difference between soundness and credential privacy, and define them together in one definition. Also, we propose a provably secure single sign-on authentication scheme, which satisfies soundness, preserves credential privacy, meets user anonymity, and supports session key exchange.

AES operations are performed on a two-dimensional array using four rows and four columns for the encryption with 128-bit Key length. The Key expansion unit is set the flexible architecture with 128-, 196- and 256-bit cipher Key length. The reconfigurable Key generator further increases the AES hardware flexibility.

Sixteen free cells of array are connected using the switchbox to operate the encryption of AES algorithm. The on-line fault detection based on parity code is designed to check fault cell.

DRM technologies have a poor reputation and are not yet trusted. This book describes the key aspects of content protection and DRM systems, the objective being to demystify the technology and techniques. In the first part of the book, the author builds the foundations, with sections that cover the rationale for protecting digital video content; video piracy; current toolboxes that employ cryptography, watermarking, tamper resistance, and rights expression languages; different ways to model video content protection; and DRM. In the second part, he describes the main existing deployed solutions, including video ecosystems; how video is protected in broadcasting; descriptions of DRM systems, such as Microsoft's DRM and Apple's FairPlay; techniques for protecting prerecorded content distributed using DVDs or Blu-ray; and future methods used to protect content within the home network. The final part of the book looks towards future research topics, and the key problem of interoperability. While the book focuses on protecting video content, the DRM principles and technologies described are also used to protect many other types of content, such as ebooks, documents and games. The book will be of value to industrial researchers and engineers developing related technologies, academics and students in information security, cryptography and media systems, and engaged consumers. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

CAC has gained popularity with the emergence of distributed computing, especially cloud computing and ""everything as a service"". CAC is not a formal model, but an enforcement paradigm.

The proxy signer issues a signature by using a proxy signing key, encrypts the signature under a designated public key, and subsequently convinces a verifier that the resulting ciphertext contains such a signature.

This facilitates information privacy enforcement in cloud environments by withholding data ownership information from cloud nodes that compute using the data. As a result, nodes that have access to private data in unencrypted form do not know who owns it, what role their computations play in the larger computational task, or to whom their computation results are ultimately delivered. To provide this data ownership privacy, the cloud's distributed computing resources are leveraged to implement an anonymizing circuit based on Tor, through which users submit private data and jobs. A tunable parameter k controls a trade-off between the degree of anonymity and the computational overhead imposed by the system. Anonymous authentication based on publickey cryptography safely links jobs and data to customers for billing purposes without revealing these associations to untrusted computation nodes.

The project is facing massive resistance from German physicians, which has led to a delay of more than five years. Little is known about the actual burdens and drivers for adoption of e-health innovations by physicians. Objective: Based on a quantitative study of German physicians who participated in the national testbed for telemedicine, this article extends existing technology acceptance models (TAM) for electronic health (e-health) in ambulatory care settings and elaborates on determinants of importance to physicians in their decision to use e-health applications. Methods: This study explores the opinions, attitudes, and knowledge of physicians in ambulatory care to find drivers for technology acceptance in terms of information technology (IT) utilization, process and security orientation, standardization, communication, documentation and general working patterns. We identified variables within the TAM constructs used in e-health research that have the strongest evidence to determine the intention to use e-health applications. Results: The partial least squares (PLS) regression model from data of 117 physicians showed that the perceived importance of standardization and the perceived importance of the current IT utilization (p<0.01) were the most significant drivers for accepting electronic health services (EHS) in their practice. Significant influence (p<0.05) was shown for the perceived importance of information security and process orientation as well as the documentation intensity and the e-health-related knowledge. Conclusions: This study extends work gleaned from technology acceptance studies in healthcare by investigating factors which influence perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of e-health services. Based on these empirical findings, we derive implications for the design and introduction of e-health services including suggestions for introducing the topic to physicians in ambulatory care and incentive structures for using e-health. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Ambulatory care; Determinants; E-Health; Germany; IT utilization; Process orientation; Standardization; TAM; Technology acceptance; Telematics; Telemedicine","Ambulatory Care; Attitude of Health Personnel; Attitude to Computers; Diffusion of Innovation; Electronic Health Records; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Physicians; Behavioral research; Health care; Information technology; Regression analysis; Security of data; Standardization; Telemedicine; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ambulatory care; Determinants; Ehealth; Germany; IT utilizations; Process orientation; TAM; Technology acceptance; Telematics; ambulatory care; article; computer program; computer security; health care utilization; human; information processing; information technology; medical research; physician attitude; priority journal; professional knowledge; telemedicine; Health"

For a code-based secret sharing scheme, the problem of determining the minimal access sets is reduced to finding the minimal codewords of the dual code. It is well known that the latter problem is a hard problem for an arbitrary linear code. Constant weight codes and two-weight codes have been studied in the literature, for their applications to secret sharing schemes. In this paper, we study a class of three-weight codes. Making use of the finite projective geometry, we will give a sufficient and necessary condition for a linear code to be a three-weight code. The geometric approach that we will establish also provides a convenient method to construct three-weight codes. More importantly, we will determine the minimal codewords of a three-weight code, making use of the geometric approach. © 2012 IEEE.","","Cryptography; Geometry; Algebraic structures; Code-words; Constant weight codes; Cryptographic applications; Dual codes; Finite projective geometry; Geometric approaches; Hard problems; Linear codes; Secret sharing schemes; Sufficient and necessary condition; Type II; Information theory"

At first, we research and analyze the advantages of addition-chain-method, m-ary and other algorithms respectively in terms of speeding computation by comparison. It is discovered that the proportion of atomic operation and window width are 2 key factors which keep the speed of scalar multiplication and its computation cost in a leash. Then, an innovative scalar-point-multiplication algorithm is designed by the project crew on the basis of findings of project research. At last, the results of theoretical analysis and experimentation statistics demonstrate that by this algorithm the average of hamming weight of the scalar as a multiplicator could be undercut and the computation cost of point-scalar-multiplication could be lowered to an amazing extent. In addition, because of its built-in scheme whereby the window width is randomized constantly it presents a favorable strong immunity against most attack methods hinged on power analysis. As a whole, it is potential that Improved-m-ary be a practical and promising fast scalar multiplication method alternative. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Addition chain; ECC; Flexible window width; Information security; Scalar multiplication","Algorithms; Security of data; Addition chains; Atomic operation; Attack methods; Computation costs; Computation power; Computational security; Depth first; ECC; Elliptic curve; Flexible window; Hamming weights; Novel algorithm; Power analysis; Project crews; Scalar multiplication; Strong immunity; Window width; Cost benefit analysis"

In this paper, immunity-based anomaly intrusion detection method, referred to as IAID, is proposed and its application for security evaluation of e-Government affair systems is discussed. IAID builds the profile using only a subset of normal elements and adapts the varieties of self and non-self space, which adjust adaptively the self radius, the detection radius, and numbers of detectors to amend the built profile.

Decisions to invest in information security technology are often made based on an assessment of its immediate value to the organization. However an important source of value comes from the fact that such security technologies have the potential to be leveraged in the diminishing of future malicious attacks. Vendors need an analytical model that shows the process by which this potential is converted into business value. We discuss a software vender to invest in security technology before launching their production in the market as a sample, because security investments create growth options that can be exercised if and when an organization decides to develop security technologies to avoid malicious attacks. This paper develops a real option model to investigate the value of this information security investment opportunity which is able to handle the multiple uncertainties from market, software vulnerability and technological aspects. The uncertain market and software vulnerability announcements uncertain factors will be transformed into a security of software products value function which is incorporated with Geometric Brownian Motion and Jump process. Unlike the conventional jump-diffusion model, the jump in our model is designed as strictly negative to account for any soft vulnerability to be announced and will only work on the drift term for a direct loses to the underlying value. Moreover, we include the learning effect that will induce the cost reduction into the valuation. In particular, our study provides an operational approach to calculate the value of secure software. © 2012 IEEE.","Information security investment; Jump-diffusion process; Option pricing; Security business value","Brownian movement; Commerce; Economics; Investments; Markov processes; Technology; Business value; Drift term; Geometric Brownian motion; Growth options; Information security investment; Information security technologies; Jump diffusion models; Jump process; Jump-diffusion process; Learning effects; Malicious attack; Option pricing; Real option models; Real options approach; Secure software; Security investments; Security technology; Software products; Software vendors; Software vulnerabilities; Technological aspects; Uncertain factors; Uncertain markets; Value functions; Network security"

The technical and business personnel in-charge of implementing the controls and procedures need to consider a large number of security-related statements from a heterogeneous pool of security documentation and decide on the implementation plan. The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach to analyze a set of security statements to establish an implicit hierarchy and relative importance among them. Design/methodology/approach - A set of statements relevant to e-mail service security is chosen from the classified documentation of an IT firm. The authors contacted the technical person who was the owner of this service to obtain a one-on-one comparison between the policies. These policies and their inter-relationships are represented as a graph. Centrality measures based on the in and out degrees of a node are used to calculate the relative importance of a policy. The authors present an improved approach based on DEMATEL, which considers the level of influence of one policy on another. Findings - Security statements fall into different categories based on their relative intensity and nature. They could be of high importance or low on one axis and of driving or receiving nature on the other. The driver policies are the action items that could be implemented to satisfy a large number of other security requirements. The policies that are predominantly receiver in nature, for their fulfillment, need many other requirements to be satisfied. Practical implications - The intense driver policies are the ones to be considered for immediate implementation so as to achieve maximum benefits. If such an action item cannot be implemented at the level of consideration, it needs to be communicated to the appropriate level where it could be addressed effectively. An orphaned policy statement can indicate to a high-level requirement left without any action plan or an unnecessary control. Establishing clear linkages between the implemented controls and the organization's security policy document could be very effective in convincing the employees to adhere to security practices. Originality/value - Analyzing a set of informal security statements to identify the linkages between them is a novel idea. While other works establish the need for translating the security policy to lower levels of implementation, the authors propose an approach to identify the existence or absence of an effective translation. The graph representation with associated centrality measures, and the application of DEMATEL technique to deduce the nature and intensity of security statements are not yet found in literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Data security; Decision making trial and evaluation technique; Degree centrality; Information management; Information security management; Information security policy","Electronic mail; Information management; Security of data; Action plan; Centrality measures; Degree centrality; DEMATEL; Design/methodology/approach; Effective translation; Email services; Graph representation; Heterogeneous pools; Information security managements; Information security policies; Inter-relationships; IT firms; Policy statements; Relative intensity; Security documentation; Security policy; Security Practice; Security requirements; Security systems"

Originally the technique was considered to be too inefficient for practical privacy-preserving applications, but in recent years rapid speed-up in computers and communication networks, algorithmic improvements, automatic generation, and optimizations have enabled their application in many scenarios. The author offers an extensive overview of the most practical and efficient modern techniques used in the design and implementation of secure computation and related protocols. After an introduction that sets secure computation in its larger context of other privacy-enhancing technologies such as secure channels and trusted computing, he covers the basics of practically efficient secure function evaluation, circuit optimizations and constructions, hardware-assisted garbled circuit protocols, and the modular design of efficient SFE protocols. The goal of the author's research is to use algorithm engineering methods to engineer efficient secure protocols, both as a generic tool and for solving practical applications, and he achieves an excellent balance between the theory and applicability.

In providing such homecare, privacy must be maintained with high security because the service is carried out not in hospital but at home, which has insufficient security. It is important to share a common platform to integrate several service providers virtually because there are many types of service providers located in different places involved in the treatment of a single patient. We developed an electronic health record (EHR) system for homecare, which is based on cloud computing technology using smartphones. In this paper, we discuss the technical aspects of information security, which are required especially for homecare based on the results of a field survey. Our focus is on strict personal authentication with SIM cards to prevent the cybercrime of stealing ID in order to maintain strict privacy of patient medical information. © 2012 IEEE.","","Industrial management; Patient treatment; Security of data; Smartphones; Common platform; Computing technology; Cybercrime; Electronic health record systems; Field surveys; Health-care system; Homecare; Medical information; Personal authentication; Service provider; SIM cards; System requirements; Technical aspects; Technology"

This incident raises some causes of concern. Firstly, critical infrastructure such as military and diplomatic systems is not spared from security breach. Secondly, such leak causes far-reaching damage to public interests, national security and economic sustainability. And thirdly, both technology and law seem incapable of dealing with such situation. Malaysia is not spared from the risk of information security attacks. Its ten critical sectors as identified in its National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP) -national defence and security; banking and finance; information and communications; energy, transport and water; government, emergency and medical services; as well as food and agriculture-can at any time fall victim to security breaches and data leaks if efforts to protect their system are flawed. The objective this paper is to outline the problems and challenges from the points of legal framework that Malaysia should anticipate and address in maintaining and sustaining its national CII. The paper first look at the problem of data breaches in the world and examine how as the technology becomes more superior, the cyber-world becomes more vulnerable to data breaches. Tied to that is the notion of critical information infrastructure (CIIs). As more and more of these CIIs are connected and dependent on connectivity, the normal incidence of data breach can be a potential of human loss and catastrophe. The paper next look at the concept of critical information security in Malaysia and examine the seriousness of data breaches in Malaysia. The paper seeks to explore legal options that Malaysia can adopt in preparing itself to more data breaches onslaught. It is the basic contention of the paper that the traditional legal framework should be reformed in line with the advances of the information and communications technologies. © 2012 IEEE.","critical information infrastructure; data breach; law and regulation; Malaysia","Computer crime; Critical infrastructures; Electronic crime countermeasures; Laws and legislation; Medical information systems; Sustainable development; Banking and finance; Critical data; Critical information; Cyber security; data breach; Economic sustainability; First look; In-line; Information and communication; Information and communications technology; law and regulation; Legal frameworks; Malaysia; Medical services; National defence; National security; Normal incidence; Problems and challenges; Public interest; Security breaches; Security of data"

Software and system developers require practical and systematic approaches to obtain sufficient and credible evidence of the security level in the system under development in order to guide their efforts and ensure the efficient use of resources. We present experiences of developing and using hierarchical security metrics and measurements in an industrial pilot study at Ericsson Finland. The pilot focused on risk-driven security design and implementation in the context of an Agile software development process. The pilot target was a well-established telecommunications product of Ericsson and a core component in modern mobile networks. The results of the study demonstrate the practical potential of risk-driven security metrics, particularly in offering some early visibility of security effectiveness and efficiency. Hierarchical metrics models enable the linking of security objectives with detailed measurements. Security metrics visualization was found to play a crucial role in increasing the manageability of metrics. We also found that the practical means of managing larger collections of metrics and measurements are more essential than individual security metrics. A major challenge in the use of risk-driven security metrics is the lack of evidence for security effectiveness evidence in the early phases of product development and Risk Analysis, when the needs for it are at their greatest. © J.UCS.","Agile SW Development; Risk Analysis; Security metrics",""

The original medical image is first decomposed by CNT. The Low pass subband is used to embed the watermark in such a way that enables the proposed method to extract the embedded watermark in a blind manner. Inverse CNT is then applied to get the watermarked image.

However, lack of method to guide organization in choosing the technical security metrics may cause technical security control objectives and capabilities failed. This research proposes a model of technical security metrics to measure the effectiveness of network security management, such as network security controls and services such as firewall and Intrusion Detection Prevention System (IDPS) in the protection of Supervisory and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The methodology used is Plan-Do-Check-Act process model. The proposed technical security metric provides guidance for SCADA owners in complying with requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) standard.

DES models typically represent the processes associated with various business units. However, in the case of supply chains more than one business unit may need to be modelled as different organisations may be responsible for various supply chain operations such as manufacturing, transport and logistics, distribution, warehouse operations, etc. Organisations can be protective about their internal processes and can have concerns regarding data/information security and privacy. Thus it could be argued that creating a single DES supply chain model representing the various inter-organisational processes is usually not an option since this will run counter to organisational privacy. Further, issues such as data transfer, model composability and execution speed may also make a single model approach problematic. A potential solution could be to create several distinct and well-defined DES models, each modelling the processes associated with one specific supply chain business unit, linked together over the internet. We refer to this possible distributed approach as Distributed Supply Chain Simulation (DSCS). Although this approach holds great promise, there are technical barriers in using DSCS. The paper discusses the benefits and barriers of a distributed approach and then, using a healthcare DSCS, the technological feasibility is demonstrated. In conclusion, the paper argues that adopting a standardised approach to DSCS will remove a major barrier to its use. © 2011 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.","Distributed simulation; Distributed supply chain simulation; Healthcare; High-level architecture; Standards; Supply chain simulation","Data transfer; Discrete event simulation; Health care; Standards; Business units; Distributed approaches; Distributed simulations; Execution speed; High level architecture; Informed decision; Model composability; Potential solutions; Run counters; Security and privacy; Single model approach; Supply chain models; Supply chain operation; Supply chain simulation; Technical barriers; Technological feasibility; Warehouse operation; Supply chains"

Coercers and bribers can utilize various verification behaviors to determine their voter manipulation by confirming whether or not a voter complied with their instructions, which is making all voting systems vulnerable. Existing published methods have been inadequate because either those emphasizing practicality have not been able to achieve effective protection due to their overtly simple protection method, or others that emphasize on theories have been difficult to put into practice due to the complicated protection method devised. In this study, we propose an efficient and secure e-voting scheme that employs the password property to form a trapdoor for protecting ballot secrecy and hence withstand verification behaviors. The designed scheme could enhance the overall volition of participating in voting, as it corresponds to the three elements of information security and integrates with the required security for electronic voting, such as verifying the identity of voters and the anonymity of voting to prevent voters from being coerced and bribed, the volition of not being controlled by external factors and the scheme being able to be operated on different computers, portable devices or different platforms. © 2012 The Author 2012.

The process of using two mutually exclusive encryption channels makes the system more robust against attacks since both the channels should be decrypted accurately in order to get a recognizable reconstruction. Results show that the reconstructed object is unrecognizable even when the portion of the correct phase keys used during decryption is close to 75%. The system is verified against blind decryptions by evaluating the SNR and MSE.

Around two-thirds of these deaths are due to acute events, which frequently occur suddenly and are often fatal before medical care can be given. New strategies for screening and early intervening CVD, in addition to the conventional methods, are therefore needed in order to provide personalized and pervasive healthcare. In this special issue, selected emerging technologies in health informatics for screening and intervening CVDs are reported. These papers include reviews or original contributions on 1) new potential genetic biomarkers for screening CVD outcomes and high-throughput techniques for mining genomic data; 2) new imaging techniques for obtaining faster and higher resolution images of cardiovascular imaging biomarkers such as the cardiac chambers and atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries, as well as possible automatic segmentation, identification, or fusion algorithms; 3) new physiological biomarkers and novel wearable and home healthcare technologies for monitoring them in daily lives; 4) new personalized prediction models of plaque formation and progression or CVD outcomes; and 5) quantifiable indices and wearable systems to measure them for early intervention of CVD through lifestyle changes. It is hoped that the proposed technologies and systems covered in this special issue can result in improved CVD management and treatment at the point of need, offering a better quality of life to the patient. © 2012 IEEE.","Acute cardiac events; information security; personalized risk prediction; sudden cardiac deaths; wearable health system","Cardiovascular Diseases; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Medical Informatics; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Preventive Health Services; Risk Assessment; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Health risks; Image segmentation; Imaging techniques; Security of data; Wearable computers; Acute cardiac events; Atherosclerotic plaque; Automatic segmentations; Cardiac chambers; Cardiac death; Cardiovascular disease; Conventional methods; Coronary arteries; Daily lives; Early intervention; Emerging technologies; Fusion algorithms; Genomic data; Health informatics; Health systems; High-throughput technique; Higher resolution images; Home healthcare; Pervasive healthcare; Prediction model; Quality of life; Risk predictions; Risk screening; Wearable systems; ambulatory monitoring; cardiovascular disease; diagnostic imaging; editorial; human; medical informatics; preventive health service; risk assessment; signal processing; Patient treatment"

On the other hand, most security mechanisms provide no immunity to security-critical user applications if vulnerabilities are present in the underlying OS. While technologies have been proposed that facilitate isolation of security-critical software, they require either significant computational resources and are hence not applicable to many resource-constrained embedded systems, or necessitate extensive redesign of the underlying processors and hardware. In this work, we propose INVISIOS: a lightweight, minimally intrusive hardware-software architecture to make the execution of security-critical software invisible to the OS, and hence protected from its vulnerabilities. The INVISIOS software architecture encapsulates the security-critical software into a self-contained software module. While this module is part of the kernel and is run with kernel-level privileges, its code, data, and execution are transparent to and protected from the rest of the kernel. The INVISIOS hardware architecture consists of simple add-on hardware components that are responsible for bootstrapping the secure core, ensuring that it is exercised by applications in only permitted ways, and enforcing the isolation of its code and data. We implemented INVISIOS by enhancing a full-system emulator and Linux to model the proposed software and hardware enhancements, and applied it to protect a commercial cryptographic library. Our experiments demonstrate that INVISIOS is capable of facilitating secure execution at very small overheads, making it suitable for resource-constrained embedded systems and systems-on-chip. © 2012 ACM.","","Computer operating systems; Embedded systems; Hardware; Software architecture; Computational resources; Hardware architecture; Hardware components; Resource-constrained; Secure execution; Security mechanism; Software modules; Systems on chips; Security of data"

As such, the Internet is international, decentralized, and comprised of networks and infrastructure largely owned and operated by private sector entities. As the Internet grows and becomes more pervasive in all aspects of modern society, the question of how it should be governed becomes more pressing. Currently, an important aspect of the Internet is governed by a private sector, international organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which manages and oversees some of the critical technical underpinnings of the Internet such as the domain name system and Internet Protocol (IP) addressing. ICANN makes its policy decisions using a multistakeholder model of governance, whereby a ""bottom-up"" collaborative process is open to all constituencies of Internet stakeholders. National governments have recognized an increasing stake in ICANN policy decisions, especially in cases where Internet policy intersects with national laws addressing such issues as intellectual property, privacy, law enforcement, and cybersecurity. Some governments around the world are advocating increased intergovernmental influence over the way the Internet is governed. For example, specific proposals have been advanced that would create an Internet governance entity within the United Nations (U.N.). Other governments (including the United States), as well as many other Internet stakeholders, oppose these proposals and argue that ICANN's multi-stakeholder model, while not perfect and needing improvement, is the most appropriate way to govern the Internet. Currently, the U.S. government, through the National Tele-communications and Information Administration (NTIA) at the Department of Commerce, enjoys a unique influence over ICANN, largely by virtue of its legacy relationship with the Internet and the domain name system. A key issue for Congress is whether and how the U.S. government should continue to maximize U.S. influence over ICANN's multistakeholder Internet governance process, while at the same time effectively resisting proposals for an increased role by international governmental institutions such as the U.N. The outcome of this debate will likely have a significant impact on how other aspects of the Internet may be governed in the future, especially in such areas as intellectual property, privacy, law enforcement, Internet free speech, and cybersecurity. Looking forward, the institutional nature of Internet governance could have far reaching implications on important policy decisions that will likely shape the future evolution of the Internet. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The development of a health information system was suggested in Title II of HIPAA as a means of promoting standardization to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system and ensure that electronic healthcare information is transferred securely and kept private. Since the legislation places the onus of providing the described improvements on healthcare institutions and part of these requirements relate to information technology (IT) and information security (IS), the process of complying with the legislation will necessitate acquiring products and services from IT/IS firms. From the viewpoint of stock market analysts, this increase in demand for IT/IS products and services has the potential to boost the profitability of public IT/IS firms, in turn positively enhancing their stock market valuation. Following the same logic, the legislation's compliance burdens shared by healthcare firms are expected to require hefty costs, thus potentially reducing the profitability of healthcare firms and reflecting negatively on their stock price. The intent of this paper is to evaluate the stock market reaction to the introduction of HIPAA legislation by evaluating the abnormal movement in the price of the stock of public healthcare institutions, IT, and IS firms. We conduct event-study analyses around the announcement dates of the various provisions of HIPAA. An event study is a standard statistical methodology used to determine whether the occurrence of a specific event or events results in a statistically significant reaction in financial markets. The advantage of the event study methodology for policy analysis is that it provides an anchor for determining value, which eliminates reliance on ad hoc judgments about the impact of specific events or policies on stock prices. While event studies have been conducted that examine the market effect of security and privacy breaches on firms, none has attempted to determine the impact, in terms of resulting market reaction, of the HIPAA legislation itself. The results of the study confirm the logic above, while also providing insight into specific stages of the legislative path of HIPAA. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

My statement today summarizes our report issued last year, titled Information Security: Federal Guidance Needed to Address Control Issues with Implementing Cloud Computing1 and describes actions taken by federal agencies to implement our report's recommendations. Cloud computing, an emerging form of delivering computing services, can, at a high level, be described as a form of computing where users have access to scalable, on-demand information technology (IT) capabilities that are provided through Internet-based technologies. Examples of cloud computing include Web-based e-mail applications and common business applications that are accessed online through a browser, instead of through a local computer. Cloud computing can potentially deliver several benefits over current systems, including faster deployment of computing resources, a decreased need to buy hardware or to build data centers, and more robust collaboration capabilities. However, along with these benefits are the potential risks that any new form of computing services can bring, including information security breaches, infrastructure failure, and loss of data. Media reports have described security breaches of cloud infrastructure and reports by others have identified security as the major concern hindering federal agencies from adopting cloud computing services. My statement today will provide a description of (1) the information security implications of using cloud computing services in the federal government, (2) our previous reporting on federal efforts and guidance to address cloud computing information security, and (3) our recommendations and subsequent actions taken by federal agencies to address federal cloud computing security issues. In preparing this statement, we summarized the content of our May 2010 report on cloud computing security. In conducting the work for that report, we collected and analyzed information from industry groups, private sector organizations, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and 24 major federal agencies.2 In addition, we followed up with agencies to determine the extent to which the recommendations made in that report have been implemented. The work for the report on which this statement is based was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We extend the X10 concurrent programming language with coarse-grained information-flow control. Central to X10 concurrency abstractions is the notion of a place: a container for data and computation. We associate a security level with each place, and restrict each place to store only data appropriate for that security level. When places interact only with other places at the same security level, then our security mechanisms impose no restrictions. When places of differing security levels interact, our information security analysis prevents potentially dangerous information flows, including information flow through covert scheduling channels. The X10 concurrency mechanisms simplify reasoning about information flow in concurrent programs. We present a static analysis that enforces a noninterference- based extensional information security condition in a calculus that captures the key aspects of X10's place abstraction and async-finish parallelism. We extend this security analysis to support many of X10's language features, and have implemented a prototype compiler for the resulting language.

Once the sensors of the control system are under attack, the actual output will change. At every moment, the difference between the predicted output of the industrial control model and the measured signal by the sensors is calculated, and then the time-based statistical sequence is formed. By the non-parametric CUSUM algorithm, the online detection of the intrusion attacks is implemented and alarmed. The simulated detection experiments show that the proposed method has a good real-time and low false alarm rate. By choosing appropriate parameters τ and β of the non-parametric CUSUM algorithm, the intrusion detection method can accurately detect the attacks before substantial damage to the control system and it is also helpful to monitor the misoperation.","Anomaly detection; Industrial control system; Network security; Non-parametric cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm","Algorithms; Control systems; Intelligent control; Mathematical models; Network security; Sensors; Anomaly detection; Cumulative sum algorithms; Cumulative sums; CUSUM algorithms; Detection experiments; False alarm rate; Industrial control systems; Industrial controls; Intrusion detection method; Measured signals; Misoperation; Non-parametric; On-line detection; Intrusion detection"

This research reviewed the controls recommended by well known standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53; and identified security controls that can be automated by existing hard-and software tools. The research also analyzed the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technology and proposed a SIEM-based framework for security controls automation, taking into account the automation potential of SIEM systems and their integration possibilities with several security tools. About 30 per cent of information security controls can be automated and they were grouped in a list of ten automatable security controls. A SIEM-based framework can be used for centralized and integrated management of the ten automatable security controls. By implementing the proposed framework and therefore automating as many security controls as possible, organizations will achieve more efficiency in information security management, reducing also the complexity of this process. This research may also be useful for SIEM vendors, in order to include more functionality to their products and provide a maximum of security controls automation within SIEM platforms. This paper delimits the boundaries of information security automation and defines what automation means for each security control. A novel framework for security controls automation is proposed.

With the increase in use of reconfigurable FPGAs in production designs and in implementation of system on FPGA applications, protecting IP preserves competitive advantage and protects investment. In this paper, a novel wireless scheme based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is proposed for securing the information contained in the FPGA IP cores. The existing FPGA core IPP techniques are basically IP core infringement detection techniques with limited protection capability and they do not prevent the unauthorized usage of IP cores. The proposed work is distinct from other existing works, as it is an IP infringement preventive scheme that employs wireless authentication and remote activation techniques to provide access control protection for IP cores. The proposed scheme also overcomes the secure secret decryption key storage problem associated with traditional encryption-based IPP techniques that are widely used for IPP of reconfigurable FPGA IP cores. The results derived from the testing of hardware prototype used for the evaluation of the proposed scheme are quite encouraging. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Authentication protection; Decryption key transmission; Intellectual property protection (IPP); Radio frequency identification (RFID); Reconfigurable field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs); Remote activation","Authentication; Compensation (personnel); Competition; Cryptography; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Intellectual property; Investments; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Security of data; Signal receivers; Competitive advantage; Detection technique; FPGA applications; FPGA core; Hardware prototype; Intellectual property cores; Intellectual property protection; Intellectual property protection techniques; IP core; Key storage; Production designs; Radio frequency identification technology; Reconfigurable FPGA; Remote activation; Reconfigurable hardware"

Multiple binary biometric signatures, such as fingerprint, iris scan, signature, and personal identification text information, are encrypted individually using orthogonal codes and then multiplexed together to form a single two dimensional binary image matrix. A color cover image is then decomposed into three color channel images, namely, red, green and blue. The matrix is then embedded into one of the channel images using the random bit selection process based on user-supplied keys, which chooses one from three least significant bits of the cover image to hide the bit of the biometric information. Three sets of encrypted binary information are embedded into three color component images. Then all three stego images are combined to form the color stego image, which hides a number of biometric information inside the image and makes them invisible to intruders. Computer simulation results using sample color images and biometric information show no visual distortion in stego image as compared to cover image. Also the histogram analyses of cover and stego images confirm that there are no significant changes in the image because of these embedding processes. The proposed embedding process is highly secure such that no information can be retrieved without knowing the process and the correct keys used for encryption. Orthogonal coding technique further enhances the security by increasing robustness and making it practically impossible to access the information without authorization. Simulation experiments prove that most steganalysis methods would fail in detecting any meaningful information from the stego image.","Biometric features; Color image; Orthogonal coding; Pseudo-random numbers; Steganography; Walsh code","Biometrics; Computer simulation; Cryptography; Image processing; Multiplexing; Steganography; Visualization; Biometric features; Color images; Orthogonal coding; Pseudo-random numbers; Walsh code; Color"

Design/methodology/approach: Five-hundred seventy-four US travelers participated in this experimental study. The respondents were exposed to one of three different scenarios: ""negative"", where an information security breach happened in the hotel where a person stayed last and guest information was compromised; ""neutral"", where an information security breach happened and guest information remained safe; and ""positive"", where participants were told that the hotel where they last stayed successfully passed a comprehensive security audit, meaning that their guest information is properly handled and secured. Findings: The results of the study revealed a significant impact of the treatments on three of the four outcome variables: satisfaction, likelihood of recommending a hotel, and revisit intentions. Information security breach scenarios resulted in a negative impact on the outcome variables regardless of whether or not the guest's credit card information was compromised. A positive scenario revealed a significant increase in guest satisfaction and revisit intentions scores. Practical implications: The findings of the study provide clear indication that hotel operators must continually strive to keep the sensitive data that is collected from their guests secure, and that failure to do so can have significant negative ramifications on current and future guests. The results also suggest that hotels should openly publicize their achievements in the field of PCI compliance. Originality/value: The study contributes to the body of knowledge on the importance of credit card information security breaches to hotel guest satisfaction and future behavior. To date, this is the only study that has investigated this topic in the hospitality industry, and it therefore makes a significant improvement towards the understanding of the impact of information security breach on hotel guest perceptions and future intentions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Attitude surveys; Data security; Experimental design; Hotel; Information security breach; Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS); Revisit intentions; Satisfaction; Service quality; Word of mouth",""

This PIA addresses for the EINSTEIN Program: - What and why the information is being collected; - The intended use of the agency information; - With whom the information will be shared; - What notice or opportunities for consent would be provided to individuals regarding information collected; - How that information is shared and secured; and - Whether a system of records is being created under section 552a of title 5, United States Code (the -Privacy Act""). • The EINSTEIN Program is an automated process for collecting, correlating, analyzing, and sharing computer security information across the Federal civilian government. By collecting information from participating Federal government agencies, the US-CERT builds and enhances our nation's cyber-related situational awareness. Awareness will facilitate identifying and responding to cyber threats and attacks, improve network security, increase the resiliency of critical, electronically delivered government services, and enhance the survivability of the Internet. • The US-CERT has prepared the EINSTEIN Program to implement statutory and administrative responsibilities in two distinct, but related areas. - First, in accordance with the mandate of the Homeland Security Act, as well as of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the US-CERT will deploy the EINSTEIN Program to help protect cyberspace. - Second, in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (-FISMA?), the EINSTEIN Program supports Federal agencies in their efforts to comply with Congressional requirements for information security, including compliance with information assurance guidelines prepared by OMB. The EINSTEIN Program provides an essential layer of protection for the Federal Enterprise Architecture (-FEA?) and the IT infrastructure used to deliver essential citizen services. There are no other cross-agency, automated processes that support FISMA compliance, protect the FEA, and focus on delivery of essential government services. • In this manner, the EINSTEIN Program supports Federal agencies' efforts to protect their computer networks. System and network administrators within each agency are responsible for guarding access to sensitive information and computing infrastructure. During the past several years, network attacks and disruptions have become increasingly common and occur at rates that prevent government officials from managing risks effectively without a collective and collaborative information-sharing program. Bothstatutory provisions and the Office of Management and Budget require agencies to share incident and risk data with the US-CERT to accomplish these goals. • Federal agency partners are the core of the EINSTEIN Program's capability. Each Federal agency administrator retains complete control of network data in strict accordance with Federal laws and polices. Agencies gather and subsequently share security data directly with the US-CERT, based on reporting requirements established by OMB. In turn, the US-CERT prepares a strategic, cross-agency assessment, which is then shared back with all Federal civilian agencies. Federal civilian agencies are -- in return for sharing anomaly and security data -- better positioned to protect their systems, save scarce resources, and provide essential services. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is challenging, yet important, to specify what it means for such systems to be secure, and to gain assurance that a system is secure. We present a language-based model for specifying, reasoning about, and enforcing information security in systems that dynamically change the security policy. We specify security for such systems as a simple and intuitive extensional knowledge-based semantic condition: an attacker can only learn information in accordance with the current security policy. Importantly, the semantic condition is parameterized by the ability of the attacker. Learning is about change in knowledge, and an observation that allows one attacker to learn confidential information may provide a different attacker with no new information. A program that is secure against an attacker with perfect recall may not be secure against a more realistic, weaker, attacker. We introduce a compositional model of attackers that simplifies enforcement of security, and demonstrate that standard information-flow control mechanisms, such as security-type systems and information-flow monitors, can be easily adapted to enforce security for a broad and useful class of attackers. © 2012, Daniel Hedin.","","Flow control; Knowledge based systems; Security of data; Semantics; Compositional models; Confidential information; Data change; Dynamic policy; Information flow control; Information flows; Parameterized; Security policy; Security systems"

Having surveyed the various approaches in the DW literature, we observed that most of the approaches consider security issue right from the conceptual model and moves towards subsequent logical and physical model. However, very little work is seen in the DW literature that considers security aspect from requirements level, which is very important to arrive at subsequent models of DW. Further, we evaluated different approaches for DW design on various security specific parameters like confidentiality, integrity, availability, access control and audit measures, inference control, traceability, interoperability, etc. The proposed evaluation will help the designers while selecting the appropriate approach for designing a secure DW. This will also motivate readers to explore the possibility of proposing new approach for DW design considering security issues into account. © 2012 ACM.","abstraction levels; data warehouse; information security; security modeling","Access control; Availability; Data warehouses; Information science; Life cycle; Security of data; Surveys; Abstraction level; Conceptual model; Design and Development; Heterogeneous sources; Inference control; Information integrated; Physical model; Security issues; Security modeling; Systems development life cycle; Unauthorized users; Design"

The main idea is to model the uncertainty of data sources and determine its influence on output accuracy by solving the model. This approach is particularly natural for data sources that rely on sampling, such as questionnaires or monitoring, since uncertainty can be expressed using the central limit theorem.

NCSD deployed EINSTEIN in phases including EINSTEIN 1, EINSTEIN 2, and the Initiative 3 Exercise (Exercise), with each phase adding new functionality. The first phase, EINSTEIN 1 was launched in 2004 and serves as an automated process for collecting computer network security information from voluntarily participating federal executive agencies. EINSTEIN 1 collects network flow records,1 which identify the source Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer that connects to the federal system; the port the source uses to communicate; the time the communication occurred; the federal destination IP address; the protocol used to communicate; and, the destination port. EINSTEIN 2, launched in 2008, incorporates network intrusion detection that monitors for malicious activity in network traffic to and from participating federal executive agencies. This gives the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) 2 the ability to analyze malicious activity occurring across the federal IT networks resulting in improved computer network security into the basic platform of the EINSTEIN program capabilities. This network intrusion detection technology uses a set of custom signatures3 based upon known malicious network traffic. Each new level of EINSTEIN builds on the previous one but EINSTEIN 1 and 2 continue to operate as distinct programs as new capabilities are introduced to later versions. In 2010, NCSD launched the Exercise to identify the ability of an existing Internet Service Provider to select and redirect internet traffic from a single participating government agency through the Exercise technology. The Exercise applied intrusion detection and prevention measures to that traffic and allowed for US-CERT to generate automated alerts about selected cyber threats. As the EINSTEIN program progresses EINSTEIN 1, 2 and eventually 3 will continue to work to prevent cyber threats from attacking the federal system and increase cybersecurity. NCSD conducted Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for each phase of the EINSTEIN program, which the DHS Privacy Office reviewed and approved. As NCSD looks ahead toward the next phase of the program to EINSTEIN 3, the DHS Privacy Office determined that conducting a Privacy Compliance Review (PCR) would be timely to ensure the accuracy of compliance documentation and transparency of the EINSTEIN program moving forward.4 The primary objective of the PCR was to assess NCSD's compliance with existing privacy compliance documentation, specifically the EINSTEIN 2 (May 19, 2008) and Initiative 3 Exercise (March 18, 2010) PIAs.5 To address our objective, the DHS Privacy Office reviewed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Concept of Operations for National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) - which includes EINSTEIN capabilities, international agreements, and signature templates. The DHS Privacy Office also held a question and answer session with NPPD/NCSD leadership, conducted two visits of the US-CERT analyst site, and interviewed US-CERT analysts who use, have access to, and are responsible for the accuracy of EINSTEIN program capabilities. The review was conducted from May to July 2011 and was led by the DHS and NPPD Privacy Offices. Throughout the review, the DHS Privacy Office collaborated with the leadership of NPPD and NCSD including the: former US-CERT Director; Acting USCERT Director; US-CERT Deputy Chief of Operations; Network Security Deployment, System Sustainment and Operations Section Chief; and Director, Network Security Deployment. NPPD/NCSD recently hired a senior privacy analyst to work on privacy protections and issues for the EINSTEIN program. This review occurred before the analyst could be fully integrated into the general practices of NCSD. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

Hardware-based technologies of trusted computing and methods in (software based) code attestation can successfully measure some property of program, static or code oriented, but fail to measure integrity of certain behaviors during the executing of codes. This situation partially is due to the lack of proper theory of dynamic integrity, which can be changed with sound and precise concepts and models of measuring dynamic integrity. In this paper, we develop the concept of dynamic integrity after analysis of attacks and model of measuring dynamic integrity, and use the idea of provable secure from cryptography to give a formal notion of the concept. And we discuss its relationship with several other cryptography primitives, such as message authentication code schemes, code obfuscation etc. Based on the model, a complier-aided flow embedding method is proposed to achieve a weak form of dynamic integrity scheme, and security and efficiency are analyzed with some reasonable assumptions. Finally, we discuss how to compile any program enhanced by dynamic integrity measurable scheme and issues concerning the compiling process.","Code attestation; Compiler-aided; Model of dynamic integrity; Program behavior; Trusted software","Cryptography; Formal concept analysis; Program compilers; Security of data; Code attestation; Code obfuscation; Compiler-aided; Coupled systems; Dynamic integrity; Embedding method; Message authentication codes; Program behavior; Software-based; Theory of dynamics; Trusted computing; Weak form; Dynamic models"

We propose a authenticated key renewal protocol which uses only symmetric cryptography. The protocol takes into account other factors important for embedded and human held network devices: It covers multi-factor authentication to take advantage of secrets possessed by the secure device as well as the memorable password of the device owner. The protocol can, further, allow partial leakage of stored secret from a secure device.

Information security is an ongoing challenge and security breaches emerging from user misbehavior are considered to be a devastating latent source of threats to patient data. This study evaluated information security practices of nurses at the King Saudi University Hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Method: A random sample of nurses (n=352; 328 females and 24 males; age 40 ± 0.6 yr (mean ± SE)) was interviewed. Results: The results show that while 92% of nurses agree that the principle of password authentication is important, their behavior in practice is completely inconsistent with this principle. This is clearly indicated by the fact that 81% of the interviewed nurses have never changed their system generated passwords, 54% do not change their passwords after these have been released to unauthorized persons, 33% share and communicate passwords with colleagues, 32% allow others to use their account credentials, and 16% do not log off applications after work sessions. Conclusion: The current study has demonstrated that the information security practices of nurses may represent a potential threat to the information security and privacy of patients. The study calls for raising the level of security awareness among nurses to reduce the security threats posed by user misbehavior.","Hospital information systems; Information security; Nursing informatics; Privacy; User behavior","adult; article; female; hospital policy; human; information dissemination; information processing; information security; interpersonal communication; male; medical information; medical information system; nurse attitude; Saudi Arabia; university hospital"

Critical infrastructure commonly refers to those entities that are so vital that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national security, economic security, or the public health and safety. This report discusses selected legal issues that frequently arise in the context of recent legislation to address vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure to cyber threats, efforts to protect government networks from cyber threats, and proposals to facilitate and encourage sharing of cyber threat information amongst private sector and government entities. This report also discusses the degree to which federal law may preempt state law. It has been argued that, in order to ensure the continuity of critical infrastructure and the larger economy, a regulatory framework for selected critical infrastructure should be created to require a minimum level of security from cyber threats. On the other hand, others have argued that such regulatory schemes would not improve cybersecurity while increasing the costs to businesses, expose businesses to additional liability if they fail to meet the imposed cybersecurity standards, and increase the risk that proprietary or confidential business information may be inappropriately disclosed. In order to protect federal information networks, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in conjunction with the National Security Agency (NSA), uses a network intrusion system that monitors all federal agency networks for potential attacks. Known as EINSTEIN, this system raises significant privacy implications-a concern acknowledged by DHS, interest groups, academia, and the general public. DHS has developed a set of procedures to address these concerns such as minimization of information collection, training and accountability requirements, and retention rules. Notwithstanding these steps, there are concerns that the program may implicate privacy interests protected under the Fourth Amendment. Although many have argued that there is a need for federal and state governments, and owners and operators of the nation's critical infrastructures, to share information on cyber vulnerabilities and threats, obstacles to information sharing may exist in current laws protecting electronic communications or in antitrust law. Private entities that share information may also be concerned that sharing or receiving such information may lead to increased civil liability, or that shared information may contain proprietary or confidential business information that may be used by competitors or government regulators for unauthorized purposes. Several bills in the 112th Congress would seek to improve the nation's cybersecurity, and may raise some or all of the legal issues mentioned above. For example, H.R. 3523 (Rogers (Mich.)) addresses information sharing between the intelligence community and the private sector. H.R. 3674 (Lungren) includes provisions regarding the protection of critical infrastructure, as well as information sharing. S. 2102 (Feinstein) seeks to facilitate information sharing. S. 2105 (Lieberman) includes the information sharing provisions of S. 2102, as well as provisions relating to the protection of critical infrastructure and federal government networks. S. 2151 (McCain) also addresses information sharing among the private sector and between the private sector and the government. Many of these bills also include provisions specifically addressing the preemption of state laws. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

The focus is on the analysis of the security risks and performance of the organisation's Security Incident Management Processes and related Security Operation Centre (SOC)'s activities. HP Labs carried out the underlying R&D work in collaboration with HP Enterprise Security Services (HP ESS) and involved analysis of processes, probabilistic modeling, simulation and ""what-if"" analysis for some of HP's key customers. The outcome of this was a set of case studies from which we have been able to create this more general anonymised report illustrating the richness of the risk assessment and ""what-if"" analysis that has been carried out. The lifecycle management of security is critical for organisations to protect their key assets, ensure a correct security posture and deal with emerging risks and threats. It involves various steps, usually carried out on an ongoing, regular basis, including: risk assessment; policy definition; deployment of controls within the IT infrastructure; monitoring and governance. In this context, Security Information & Events Management (SIEM) solutions play a key role. Even the best information security practices and investments in security controls cannot guarantee that intrusions - accidental and criminal activities - and/or other malicious acts will not happen. Controls can fail, be bypassed or become inadequate over time; new threats emerge. Managing such incidents requires detective and corrective controls to minimise adverse impacts, gather evidence, and learn from previous situations in order to improve over time. These incident management processes are usually run in the context of a SOC and/or as part of specialised Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTS), built on top of SOCs. Even with SIEM solutions in place, a potential major risk for the organisation arises due to delays introduced in assessing and handling known incidents: this may postpone the successful resolution of critical security incidents (e.g. devices exposed on the Internet, exploitation of privileged accounts, deployed malware, etc.) and allow for further exploitation. Another related risk can be introduced by sudden and/or progressive changes of the threat landscape, due to changing economic and social scenarios, new business activities or process failings within the existing IT services. This might create unexpected volumes of new events and alerts to be processed by the security team and as such, introduce additional delays. Hence, it is important for an organisation to understand the risk exposure due to their Incident Management processes, explore potential future scenarios (e.g. changes in available resources or threats landscapes or adoption of Cloud solutions) and identify suitable ways to address related issues, e.g. by introducing process changes and/or making investments in security controls. © Copyright 2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.","Incident Management Processes; Risk Analysis; Security Analytics; SOC; What-if Analysis","Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Security systems; Business activities; Corrective control; Criminal activities; Enterprise security; Hp labs; Incident Management; Information security practice; IT infrastructures; IT services; Life-cycle management; Malwares; Probabilistic modeling; Process change; Related risk; Risk exposure; Security Analytics; Security controls; Security incident; Security operations; Security risks; SOC; Social scenarios; What-if Analysis; Investments"

This risky user behavior can be intentional or unintentional, but in either case can cause severe damage to an organization's reputation as well as potentially extending harm to the organization's clients and customers. Information systems users not following the corporate security policies, even though they know the policies, is known as user omissive behavior, also known as the knowing-doing gap. This research examines the information assurance understanding and security awareness at the user level by developing a structured model of the user knowing-doing gap. The model examines the role of organizational narcissism and its affect on user attitudes towards following the organization's information security policies and procedures. It also includes perceived threat as a factor affecting user attitudes towards following information security rules, as well as subjective norms and perceived behavior control consistent with the theory of planned behavior.

As such, an intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of detecting potential cross site scripting attacks is demonstrated. The IDS involves the capturing of potential client side executable content on a Web page and the hashing of that content. At a future point in time, the Web page is reprocessed for client side executable content and the content rehashed, with any differences in the hash values indicative of a potential XSS attack. It is believed that the described IDS technique would be particularly useful for Web forums and other user content driven site, since the IDS only considers content recognized as potentially executable and not normal text content, such as that which would be typically enclosed in paragraph or heading tags. © 2012 IEEE.","information security; intrusion detection; Perl; XSS","Character recognition; Intrusion detection; Security of data; Cross site scripting; Hash value; Intrusion Detection Systems; Perl; Text content; WEB application; Web Forums; XSS; Websites"

Intrusion may lead to terrible disaster for network users. Therefore, it is imperative to detect the network attacks to protect the information security. The intrusion patter identification is a hot topic in this research area. Using artificial neural networks (ANN) to provide intelligent intrusion recognition has been received a lot of attentions. However, the intrusion detection rate is often affected by the structure parameters of the ANN. Improper ANN model design may result in a low detection precision. To overcome these problems, a new network intrusion detection approach based on improved genetic algorithm (GA) and multi-ANN classifiers is proposed in this paper. The improved GA used energy entropy to select individuals to optimize the training procedure of the BPNN, RBF, PNN and Fuzzy-NN. Then, the satisfactory ANN models with proper structure parameters were attained. In addition, to alleviate the complexity of the input vector, the principal component analysis (PCA) has been employed to eliminate redundant features of the original intrusion data. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the practical data, and the experiment results show that the proposed approach offers a good intrusion detection rate, and performs better than the standard GA-ANN method. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Artificial neural network; Improved Genetic algorithm; Intrusion detection; PCA","Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Energy-entropy; Input vector; Intrusion data; Model design; Multiple neural networks; Network attack; Network intrusion detection; Network users; PCA; Redundant features; Structure parameter; Training procedures; Genetic algorithms"

However, because of the explosive heterogeneity in the current internet structure, the performance of the available solutions has been decreasing drastically. We propose an integrated secure type-2 fuzzy ontology multi-agent platform (ST2FO-MAS) to completely automate the laborious process of manual air ticket booking. The air ticket booking domain is rife with uncertainties, and most of the information is based on complex linguistic terminologies. The available fuzzy ontology schemes cannot extract intensively blurred information from the internet to provide personalized solutions. Meanwhile, information security attacks have been growing significantly, which is a discouraging indicator for e-commerce applications. The proposed ST2FO-MAS can provide an end-to-end solution that can ideally address the ongoing information security challenges. The accommodation of a multi-agent system in a secure type-2 fuzzy ontology boosts the performance of the system because of its robust autonomous working scheme. To completely judge the performance of the proposed solution, we developed an intelligent prototype system that was based on JAVA, JADE and XML security recommendations. We conducted several experiments under the supervision of domain experts, and we evaluated the performance of the system.

Generally, data confidentiality is obtained by utilizing cryptography, to ensure the highest degree of protection to users. Cryptography is one of the trusted practical methods for performing information security. The main purpose of cryptography is to provide confidentiality by converting the sensitive private information (known as plaintext) into unreadable and useless form (known as ciphertext). When cryptography is mentioned, complicated computer algorithms based on advanced mathematics first come to mind. The majority of modern cryptography algorithms involve calculations which have to be carried out on a computer. Imagine a cryptography system without any cryptographic computations on the part of the decoders; such that the decryption can be accomplished by the human visual system. Such system can be used where computers or other decryption devices are scarce and unavailable. As for the encryption, such system also does not need complex computation and as such could be done by the simplest modern computers. In the last two decades, numbers of researchers have focused on developing cryptosystems which require comparatively less complex computation. Visual cryptography is a special technique of cryptography for sharing and encrypting data, especially images, in which it is based on the pixel level manipulation with Boolean operations. In visual cryptography, the encryption operation does not require complex computations and the decryption operation is performed only by the human visual system. In this survey, an overview of the visual cryptography models is reviewed, with their methods and schemes for binary (black-and-white) images.","Binary (black-and-white) image; Boolean OR operation; Human visual system; Pixel expansion; Probabilistic visual secret sharing; Shares; Visual cryptography","Algorithms; Image processing; Pixels; Security of data; Surveys; Binary (black-and-white) image; Boolean OR operation; Human Visual System; Pixel expansion; Shares; Visual cryptography; Visual secret sharing; Cryptography"

The purpose of the paper is to increase understanding of this phenomenon and illuminate the problems that organizations face when trying to establish an information security awareness program. Design/methodology/approach: Following an interpretive approach the authors apply a case study method and employ actor network theory (ANT) and the due process for analyzing findings. Findings: The paper contributes to both understanding and managing security awareness programs in organizations, by providing a framework that enables the analysis of awareness activities and interactions with the various organizational processes and events. Practical implications: The application of ANT still remains a challenge for researchers since no practical method or guide exists. In this paper the application of ANT through the due process model extension is enhanced and practically presented. This exploration highlights the fact that information security awareness initiatives involve different stakeholders, with often conflicting interests. Practitioners must acquire, additionally to technical skills, communication, negotiation and management skills in order to address the related organizational and managerial issues. Moreover, the results of this inquiry reveal that the role of artifacts used within the awareness process is not neutral but can actively affect it.

In addition, as the trends of threats have been changed as a type of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) that attacks specific individuals and organizations for a long term period, an integrated analysis is required for all security events. Thus, in this study, an Enterprise Security Management system based on Threshold Classification (ESMTC) is proposed to detect and intercept cyber threats occurred for a long term period.

For that purpose, we introduce a formalization of data structures for signed multi-precision arithmetic and we experiment it with formal verification of basic functions, using Separation logic. Because this direct style of formal verification leads to technically involved specifications, we also propose for larger functions to show a formal simulation relation between pseudo-code and assembly.

With the increasing number of intrusion, device and identity theft incidents, improved security measures are becoming essential for accessing devices as well as various mobile applications. In this paper, a novel security architecture has been proposed for mobile computing platform which utilizes biometric signatures to authenticate users against large databases. Identifying correct biometric credentials in mobile devices can be a challenging task as there are no biometric input devices available with these systems. The task of scanning biometric signatures can be performed via device camera and microphone. The primary challenge is to precisely collect the biometric signatures and minimize the effects of noise, intra class variations, surrounding environment and high error rate when comparing against millions of similar signatures. A multimodal verification scheme applying face, hand geometry, fingerprint and other biometric signatures which can be scanned through mobile devices will increase the reliability of the system. The next challenge this architecture will address is the size of biometric signature and verification data that is sent for comparison. A fusion of multiple signatures can be performed by applying segmented data in order to increase the verification speed while maintaining high accuracy. Fusion also protects against spoofing where criminals and predatory users submit false or modified biometric information for verification. As multiple signatures are weighted and compared, false or unmatched signatures can be easily identified and addressed accordingly. In order to protect the information during data transfer and future storage, encryption and other security enhancement techniques are proposed to be integrated. The proposed architecture is expected to provide secure access to only legitimate users of a system within a short period of time and prohibit intruders from gaining any access. © 2012 IEEE.","biometrics; information security; mobile computing; systems flowchart","Architecture; Authentication; Crime; Data transfer; Laptop computers; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Network architecture; Network security; Security of data; Biometric informations; Biometric signatures; Computing platform; Error rate; Hand geometry; Identity theft; Input devices; Intra-class variation; Large database; Legitimate users; Mobile applications; Mobile computing devices; Multi-modal; Multiple signatures; Proposed architectures; Secure architectures; Secure networks; Security Architecture; Security enhancements; Security measure; Segmented data; Short periods; Surrounding environment; Third parties; Verification data; Biometrics"

In this paper, a model is proposed to provide sensitive information security using new techniques for dimensionality reduction where two new algorithms Term Similarity Clustering (TSC) and Term Index Clustering (TIC) based on supervised learning are proposed for SIS model. The TSC approach includes the lossy data reduction at the sender side, but makes the system tolerable to maintain integrity by keeping confidentiality at its best level when data is sent over on the unsecured communication channel. The terms or words are extracted from the text documents and they are categorized into Term Clusters (TC) with the use of Knowledge Repository (KR). Otherwise, it uses the KR and then makes a new entry into the appropriate TC with its associated TSC. Then these TCs of reduced dimension are provided the high security and sent over on the unsecured channel. The second approach TIC works differently and provides the lossless data reduction at the sender side with high data integrity and confidentiality during data transmission but includes an overhead of keeping KR at the receiver side. In TIC, instead of keeping the word in the TC, the index of each term, referring the knowledge repository, is placed in the respective TIC. Due to the KR overhead, this approach increases the configuration complexity at the receiver side. As both proposed approaches decrease the space and time complexities, so this paper provides the analytical experimental results of testing a text document of NASA Standards in which TSC gives about 10% space dimension reduction with some information loss, whereas TIC provides around 12% of space reduction with the additional overhead of KR at the receiver side. © 2012 IEEE.","data dimension reduction; index clustering; information security; knowledge repository; similarity clustering","Clustering algorithms; Data communication systems; NASA; Security of data; Standards; Data dimension reduction; Data integrity; Dimensionality reduction; index clustering; Information loss; Knowledge repository; Sensitive informations; similarity clustering; SIS model; Space and time complexity; Space dimensions; Space reductions; Term Similarity; Text document; Textual documents; Data reduction"

Human-centricity in this context means that medical staff should be able to configure AC rules, both in a timesaving and reliable manner. Since medical data often include meta information about a patient, it is essential that an AC system only grants access requests that meet the patient's intent. Hence, it is desirable that a patient be included in the AC process. To cater for the strong security needs in the medical domain, both the AC policy creation by medical staff as well as the patient-interaction feature need to be supervised by governing policies. While traditional AC systems such as role-based access control offer sufficient security in theory, they lack in comfort and flexibility. This property does not fulfil the requirements of flexible and distributed environments. Distributed medical institutions could enormously benefit from the opportunity of dynamic AC configuration at an end-user level while adhering to legal, ethical or other privacy requirements. Hence, this paper presents a human-centric visual AC model for medical data, addressing usability, information security and patient interaction.

Rapidly changing attacks in real-time financial service platforms continue to demonstrate fraudster's ability to actively re-engineer their methods in response to ad hoc security protocol deployments, and highlights the distinct gap between the speed of transaction execution within streaming financial data and corresponding fraud technology frameworks that safeguard the platform. This paper presents the design of FFML, a rule-based policy modelling language and encompassing architecture for facilitating the conceptual level expression and implementation of proactive fraud controls within multi-channel financial service platforms. It is demonstrated how a domain specific language can be used to abstract the financial platform into a data stream based information model to reduce policy modelling complexity and deployment latencies through an innovative policy mapping language usable by both expert and non-expert users.

Technical and formal control ensures relatively quick results but its life cycle isn't very long. Informal control focuses on the person resulting in rather long implementation periods. Successful implementation should lead to the information security culture. In this process, the user is expected to change his behavior according to specified rules and in order to achieve this the user must invest significant efforts. In order to ease this effort, one should find some motivating factors, which influence positively such situations. Moreover, a better understanding of the process occurring during the interaction of the user and the environment is important. If one takes into consideration the fact that the user in his everyday activities uses certain processes which facilitate the performance of his tasks, then the demand to change his attitudes will not be seen positively. Such a situation is very stressful for the user and will be explained using the stress model. The attitude the user adopts in such situations will finally influence the development of the information security culture. In order for this process to be successful, the user should see (or have the attitude) the demands as challenges rather than threats. This attitude depends on the personal characteristics of the user. One of them is self-efficiency. By using the methods which increase confidence in self-efficiency, one is helping the user in his efforts to modify his behaviors. © 2012 MIPRO.","","Communication; Information technology; Microelectronics; Formal controls; Informal controls; Personal characteristics; Self efficiencies; Stress models; Security of data"

We find that top management participation in information security initiatives has significant direct and indirect influences on employees' attitudes towards, subjective norm of, and perceived behavioral control over compliance with information security policies. We also find that the top management participation strongly influences organizational culture which in turn impacts employees' attitudes towards and perceived behavioral control over compliance with information security policies. Furthermore, we find that the effects of top management participation and organizational culture on employee behavioral intentions are fully mediated by employee cognitive beliefs about compliance with information security policies. Our findings extend information security research literature by showing how top management can play a proactive role in shaping employee compliance behavior in addition to the deterrence oriented remedies advocated in the extant literature.

Many organizations are not even aware that this sensitive data might be stored unencrypted on their network. While simply encrypting the database itself would appear to be sufficient to secure data at rest inside DB2, enterprises also need to consider other locations around the database where sensitive data might reside. Many of these locations are outside the direct control of database administrators (DBA). For example, database scripts typically include a username and password that provide access to the database. If compromised, these types of files could lead to a database breach.

As one of the most important facilities of power infrastructures, electrical substations undertake responsibilities of energy transmissions and distributions by operating interconnected electrical devices in a coordinated manner. Accordingly, it imposes a great challenge on information security, since any falsifications may trigger mal-operations, and result in damages to power usage. In this paper, we aim at authentication and integrity protections in substation automation systems (SAS), by an experimental approach on a small scale SAS prototype, in which messages are transmitted with commonly-used data origin authentication schemes, such as RSA, Message Authentication Code, and One-Time Signature. Through experimental results, we find that, current security solutions cannot be applied directly into the SAS due to insufficient performance considerations in response to application constraints, including limited device computation capabilities, stringent timing requirements and high data sampling rates. Moreover, intrinsic limitations of security schemes, such as complicated computations, shorter key valid time and limited key supplies, can easily be hijacked by malicious attackers, to undermine message deliveries, thus becoming security vulnerabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate guidelines in design of novel security schemes for the smart grid.

Automatic signature recognition and verification is one of the biometric techniques, which is only one of several used to verify the identity of individuals. In this paper, a foreground and background based technique is proposed for identification of scripts from bi-lingual (English/Roman and Chinese) off-line signatures. This system will identify whether a claimed signature belongs to the group of English signatures or Chinese signatures. The identification of signatures based on its script is a major contribution for multi-script signature verification. Two background information extraction techniques are used to produce the background components of the signature images. Gradient-based method was used to extract the features of the foreground as well as background components. Zernike Moment feature was also employed on signature samples. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the classifier for signature identification in the proposed system. A database of 1120 (640 English+480 Chinese) signature samples were used for training and 560 (320 English+240 Chinese) signature samples were used for testing the proposed system.

Reversible information hiding is usually designed to protect military, medical or legal multimedia documents. Conventional reversible information hiding methods are mainly performed in the spatial, DCT and DWT domains. Recently, some reversible data hiding schemes based on vector quantization (VQ) are presented; however, their main shortcomings are low hiding capacity and low stego image quality. In order to partially solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel reversible information hiding scheme for VQ-compressed images by performing a special difference coding operation on the VQ indices. During the hiding process, the difference between the current index and its neighboring ones is computed and encoded based on four cases in view of the current watermark bits to be embedded. In the decoding phase, not only the original watermark bits but also the original indices can be losslessly recovered if the codestream of the stego image is under no attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms existing VQ-based reversible information hiding methods. © 2012 ICIC International.","Difference coding; Information hiding; Reversible information hiding; Vector quantization (VQ); VQ indices","Algorithms; Image coding; Image quality; Security of data; Vector quantization; Coding operation; Copyright protections; Current index; Difference coding; Hiding capacity; High capacity; Information hiding; Internet technology; Multimedia documents; Reversible data hiding; Stego image; VQ indices; VQ-compressed images; Watermark bits; Problem solving"

So, Information Security is becoming an inseparable part of Data Communication. In order to address this Information Security Steganography plays an important role. Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one apart from the sender and intended recipient even realizes there is a hidden message. This paper is a tutorial review of the steganography techniques appeared in the literature. Various image steganography techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate steganography techniques and steganalysis techniques. We state a set of criteria to analyze and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the presented techniques. The least-significant bit (LSB) insertion method is the most common and easiest method for embedding messages in an image with high capacity, while it is detectable by statistical analysis such as RS and Chi-square analyses. This paper has proposed a novel LSB image steganography algorithm that can effectively resist image steganalysis based on statistical analysis. © 2012 IEEE.","Data extraction; Decoding the data; Encrypting the text; Locating the edges","Convolutional codes; Digital storage; Least squares approximations; Statistical methods; Adaptive images; Analog media; Art and science; Chi-square analysis; Data extraction; Data-communication; Encrypting the text; Hidden messages; High capacity; High fidelity; High quality; High speed computer networks; Image steganography; Information communication; Insertion methods; Locating the edges; Resist image; Steganalysis; Steganography"

Each channel is encrypted using first random phase mask and discrete cosine transform at input plane, and then the first gyrator transform is executed. The obtained image is again encrypted using second random phase mask and discrete cosine transform at frequency plane, and then transmitted through radial Hibert phase mask. The gyrator transform is performed on the transmitted image.

Today, it is a necessary interaction between workflow management and legal rules that govern it, to allow an efficient control of medical technology and associated costs. Another important topic that is growing in importance within the healthcare sector is compliance, which includes the retention of studies, information security, and patient privacy. Previously, we conducted a series of extensive analysis and measurements of pre-existing operating conditions. These studies and projects have been described in other papers. The first phase: hardware and software installation and initial tests were completed in March 2006. The storage phase was built step by step until the PACS-INR was totally completed. Two important aspects were considered in the integration of components: (1) the reliability and performance of the system to transfer and display DICOM images, and (2) the availability of data backups for disaster recovery and downtime scenarios. This paper describes the highavailability model for a large-scale PACS to support the storage and retrieve of data using CAS and DAS technologies to provide an open storage platform. This solution offers a simple framework that integrates and automates the information at low cost and minimum risk. Likewise, the model allows an optimized use of the information infrastructure in the clinical environment. The tests of the model include massive data migration, openness, scalability, and standard compatibility to avoid locking data into a proprietary technology. © 2011 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.","Archive; Database management systems; Digital image management; Enterprise PACS; Information storage and retrieval","Efficiency, Organizational; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Radiology Information Systems; Software; Systems Integration; Computer aided diagnosis; Database systems; Hardware; Health care; Image processing; Medical applications; Radiology; Security of data; Software testing; Work simplification; Archive; Associated costs; Clinical environments; Data backups; Digital image; Digital image management; Disaster recovery; Efficient control; Hardware and software; Hardware architecture; Healthcare sectors; High availability; Information infrastructures; Information storage and retrieval; Legal rules; Low costs; Massive data; Medical information; Medical technologies; Operating condition; Optimized use; Proprietary technologies; Standard compatibility; Storage platforms; Workflow managements; article; computer program; hospital information system; human; information retrieval; methodology; organization and management; system analysis; Information management"

Observations of the sensors are quantized and encrypted before transmission. The encryption method maps the output of the quantizer to one of the possible quantizer output levels randomly according to a probability matrix. The intended (ally) fusion center (AFC) is aware of the encryption keys (probabilities) while the unauthorized (third party) fusion center (TPFC) is not. A constrained optimization problem is formulated from the point of view of AFC in order to design its decision rule along with the encryption probabilities. The objective function to be minimized is the error probability of AFC and the constraint is a lower bound on the error probability of TPFC. In the binary case the optimal solution is found and in the nonbinary case a good suboptimal solution is analytically obtained. Numerical results are presented to show that it is possible to degrade the error probability of TPFC significantly and still achieve very low probability of error for AFC. The proposed method which may be considered a PHY-layer security scheme is highly scalable since it does not increase the packet overhead or transmit power of the sensors and has very low computational complexity. A scheme is described to randomize the keys so as to defeat any key space exploration attack. © 2012 IEEE.","Decentralized detection; decision fusion rule; information security; soft decision; wireless sensor networks","Constrained optimization; Cryptography; Security of data; Sensors; Space research; Wireless sensor networks; Bandwidth-constrained; Binary Hypothesis Testing; Constrained optimization problems; Decentralized detection; Decision fusion rules; Decision rules; Distributed detection; Encryption key; Encryption methods; Error probabilities; Fusion center; Low computational complexity; Low Power; Low probability; Lower bounds; Non-binary; Numerical results; Objective functions; Optimal solutions; Output levels; Packet overhead; PHY-layer security; Probability matrixes; Quantizers; Soft decision; Space explorations; Suboptimal solution; Third parties; Transmit power; Probability"

However, when sensitive data are integrated and shared, privacy protection and information security become key issues. This means that information systems must be secured and that access to sensitive data must be controlled. In this paper, a framework is presented to support data sharing between public organizations for collaboration purposes. The framework focuses on solutions towards optimal data sharing and integration while ensuring the security and privacy of individuals. Data sharing is based on the need-to-know principle, that is, data are only made available when they are required to perform core processes. To facilitate this, an approach is introduced in the form of a trusted third party that manages access control to personal information and thus helps to protect the privacy of individuals. It is argued that the proposed framework is suitable for data integration and sharing on various levels. An example of best practices of data sharing in the Netherlands shows how this framework facilitates data sharing to perform knowledge transfer and other higher-level tasks. © 2012 ACM.","data integration; data sharing; public sector; trusted third parties","Access control; Data privacy; Knowledge management; Data integration; Data Sharing; Knowledge transfer; Netherlands; Optimal data; Personal information; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Public organizations; Public sector; Security and privacy; Sensitive datas; Trusted third parties; Research"

The Administration's proposal contains seven sections and addresses many different subject areas. This report examines the first section of the Administration's proposal, dealing with criminal law. That section would supplement the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) by adding a mandatory three-year minimum penalty for damaging certain critical infrastructure computers, increase the penalties for most violations of the CFAA, modify the conspiracy and forfeiture provisions of the CFAA, and make felony violation of the CFAA a racketeering predicate offense. This report also compares the Administration's proposal to bills pending before the House of Representatives and the Senate. Although Congress is considering many bills addressing cybersecurity, there are relatively few which would modify computer crime laws such as the CFAA. The bills which do address computer crime differ in significant ways from the Administration's proposal, though they would accomplish some of the same goals. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

On the one hand, this improvement makes it possible to generate and store a great amount of temporal (time-oriented) data for future query, analysis and discovery of new knowledge. On the other hand, systems and experts are encountering new problems in processing this increased amount of data. The rapid growth in stored time-oriented data necessitates the development of new methods for handling, processing, and interpreting large amounts of temporal data. One approach is to use an automatic summarization process based on predefined knowledge, such the Knowledge-Based Temporal-Abstraction (KBTA) method. This method enables one to summarize and reduce the amount of raw data by creating higher level interpretations based on predefined domain knowledge. Unfortunately, the task of temporal abstraction is inherently computationally expensive, especially when an enormous volume of multivariate data has to be handled and when complex patterns need to be considered. In this research, we address the scalability problem of a temporal-abstraction task that involves processing significantly large amounts of raw data. We propose a new computational framework, the Distributed KBTA (DKBTA), which efficiently distributes the abstraction process among several parallel computational nodes, in order to achieve an acceptable computation time. The DKBTA framework distributes the temporal-abstraction process along one or more computational axes, each of which enables parallelization of one or more temporal-abstraction tasks into which the main temporal-abstraction task is decomposed, such as by different subject groups, concepts types, or abstraction types. We have implemented the DKBTA framework and have evaluated it in a preliminary fashion in the medical and the information security domains, with encouraging results. In our small-scale evaluation, only distribution along the subjects axis and sometimes along the concept-type axis seemed to consistently enhance performance, and only for computations involving individual subjects and not functions of sets of subjects; but this observation might depend on the number of processing units. Additionally, since the communication between the processing units was based on the TCP protocol, we could not observe any speedup even when using two processing units on the same machine. In our further evaluations we plan to use a shared memory architecture in order to exchange data between processing units. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Distributed computation; Knowledge-based systems; Parallel computation; Temporal data mining; Temporal reasoning; Temporal-abstraction","Knowledge based systems; Memory architecture; Security of data; Transmission control protocol; Distributed computations; Parallel Computation; Temporal data mining; Temporal reasoning; Temporal-abstraction; Abstracting"

In the teleradiology network system, the security of information network is very important subjects. We are studying the secret sharing scheme and the tokenization as a method safely to store or to transmit the confidential medical information used with the teleradiology network system. The confidential medical information is exposed to the risk of the damage and intercept. Secret sharing scheme is a method of dividing the confidential medical information into two or more tallies. Individual medical information cannot be decoded by using one tally at all. Our method has the function of automatic backup. With automatic backup technology, if there is a failure in a single tally, there is redundant data already copied to other tally. Confidential information is preserved at an individual Data Center connected through internet because individual medical information cannot be decoded by using one tally at all. Therefore, even if one of the Data Centers is struck and information is damaged due to the large area disaster like the great earthquake of Japan, the confidential medical information can be decoded by using the tallies preserved at the data center to which it escapes damage. Moreover, by using tokenization, the history information of dividing the confidential medical information into two or more tallies is prevented from lying scattered by replacing the history information with another character string (Make it to powerlessness). As a result, information is available only to those who have rightful access it and the sender of a message and the message itself are verified at the receiving point.

Currently, mediation is set up as the previous phase of a binding and institutional arbitration system (the Consumer Arbitration Scheme) that is already in place in Spain. However, the White Book on Mediation in Catalonia shows that consumer mediation services are more widespread than consumer arbitration services. It also shows that mediation services have a high percentage of success, and companies prefer consensual, non-binding mechanisms. Today, consumer mediation has sufficient practical and conceptual independence from arbitration and therefore it is recommended that a consumer mediation scheme should be fostered. Thus, this article analyses what principles should guide such a regime, specifically in the online environment. The Consumer Code in Catalonia sets up some principles of consumer mediation. This article analyses the principles of impartiality, confidentiality, of voluntary participation and universality. Moreover, it explores whether other principles recognised at the European level may be taken into account, such as the principles of transparency, fairness and effectiveness. Furthermore, this article discusses interoperability and information security.

As online business models become progressively more data intensive, the ""breathing room"" that childhood has been afforded traditionally is eroding. Using the work of Erving Goffman and creativity theorists, this Article argues that particularly in digital commercial contexts, a legal paradigm of childhood is needed that simultaneously focuses on childhood privacy and creating a space for creative tinkering leading to entrepreneurship in adulthood.

With patient records, medical staff can instantly understand the entire medical information of a patient so that, according to the patient's conditions, more accurate diagnoses and more appropriate in-depth treatments can be provided. Nevertheless, in such a modern society with booming information technologies, traditional paper-based patient records have faced a lot of problems, such as lack of uniform formats, low data mobility, slow data transfer, illegible handwritings, enormous and insufficient storage space, difficulty of conservation, being easily damaged, and low transferability. To improve such drawbacks, reduce medical costs, and advance medical quality, paper-based patient records are modified into electronic medical records and reformed into electronic patient records. However, since eletronic patient records used in various hospitals are diverse and different, in consideration of cost, it is rather difficult to establish a compatible and complete integrated electronic patient records system to unify patient records from heterogeneous systems in hospitals. Moreover, as the booming of the Internet, it is no longer necessary to build an integrated system. Instead, doctors can instantly look up patients' complete information through the Internet access to electronic patient recoreds as well as avoid the above difficulties. Nonetheless, the major problem of accessing to electronic patient records cross-hospital systems exists in the security of transmitting and accessing to the records in case of unauthorized medical personnels intercepting or stealing the information. This study applies the Mobile Agent scheme to cope with the problem. Since a Mobile Agent is a program, which can move among hosts and automatically disperse arithmetic processes, and moves from one host to another in heterogeneous network systems with the characteristics of autonomy and mobility, decreasing network traffic, reducing transfer lag, encapsulating protocol, availability on heterogeneous platforms, fault-tolerance, high flexibility, and personalization. However, since a Mobile Agent contacts and exchanges information with other hosts or agents on the Internet for rapid exchange and access to medical information, the security is threatened. In order to solve the problem, this study proposes a key management scheme based on Lagrange interpolation formulas and hierarchical management structure to make Mobile Agents a more secure and efficient access control scheme for electronic patient record systems when applied to the access of patients' personal electronic patient records cross hospitals. Meanwhile, with the comparison of security and efficacy analyses being the feasibility of validation scheme and the basis of better efficiency, the security of Mobile Agents in the process of operation can be guaranteed, key management efficacy can be advanced, and the security of the Mobile Agent system can be protected. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Access control; Electronic medical record; Information security; Lagrange's interpolation; Mobile agent","Access to Information; Algorithms; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Security; Electronic Health Records; Internet; article; cost control; electronic medical record; feasibility study; handwriting; human; information technology; medical information; medical record; medical staff; patient autonomy"

Within biometrics, automatic signature identification and verification has been a strong research area because of the social and legal acceptance and extensive use of the written signature as an individual authentication. Signature verification is a process in which the questioned signature is examined in detail in order to determine whether it belongs to the claimed person or not. Despite substantial research in the field of signature verification involving Western signatures, very few works have been dedicated to non-Western signatures such as Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, or Persian etc. In this paper, the performance of an off-line signature verification system involving Bangla signatures, whose style is distinct from Western scripts, was investigated. The Gaussian Grid feature extraction technique was employed for feature extraction and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were considered for classification. The Bangla signature database employed in the experiments consisted of 3000 forgeries and 2400 genuine signatures. An encouraging accuracy of 90.4% was obtained from the experiments. © 2012 IEEE.","authentication systems; biometrics; Gaussian Grid feature; Offline verification systems; signature verification; SVMs","Authentication; Experiments; Feature extraction; Security of data; Support vector machines; Authentication systems; Gaussians; Signature verification; SVMs; Verification systems; Biometrics"

Public officials, network service providers, information security companies, research organisations, and volunteers from all over the world can be involved; often without the participants realising whom they are working with. The cooperation is based on mostly informal bilateral arrangements and is aided by mutual trust accumulated over course of time. Each participant wants to limit their involvement and typically only assumes responsibility on their own actions. Information suggesting that third parties would be affected may or may not be followed up. The result is an unplanned mesh of bilateral information sharing and a formation of an ad-hoc network of partial stakeholders. No single entity exercises total control over the process, which makes it inherently uncontrollable and its results difficult to anticipate. This contrasts with the information security standards, where the process is expected to be well defined and under the control of a clearly stated leadership.

First, we carry out a comparative performance analysis of four detection procedures: the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) procedure, the Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) procedure, and two its modifications-the Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak and Shiryaev-Roberts-r procedures. The performance is benchmarked via Pollak's maximal average delay to detection and Shiryaev's stationary average delay to detection, each subject to a fixed average run length to false alarm. The analysis shows that in practically interesting cases the accuracy of asymptotic approximations is ""reasonable"" to ""excellent"". We also consider an application of change-point detection to cybersecurity for rapid anomaly detection in computer networks. Using real network data we show that statistically traffic's intensity can be well described by the proposed Gaussian model with σ2 = aμ instead of the traditional Poisson model, which requires σ2 = μ. By successively devising the SR and CUSUM procedures to ""catch"" a low-contrast network anomaly (caused by an Internet Control Message Protocol reflector attack), we then show that the SR rule is quicker. We conclude that the SR procedure is a better cyber ""watch dog"" than the popular CUSUM procedure. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Anomaly detection; CUSUM procedure; Cybersecurity; Intrusion detection; Sequential analysis; Sequential change-point detection; Shiryaev-Roberts procedure; Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak procedure; Shiryaev-Roberts-r procedure",""

A company can reduce maintenance, hardware, and energy costs by running virtualized servers on a single physical machine. Although virtualization offers these advantages, it introduces new challenges to current computer forensic techniques as well as computer system defense tools. As this technology continues to be adopted by more and more companies every year, malware and hacker attacks are potentially going to affect virtualized systems as they have been affecting physical systems in the past. Therefore, the increasing growth of virtualization has created the need for a new generation of computer system defenses as well as computer forensic techniques to effectively defend these systems before or after they have been attacked. Because of the nature of how virtualization operates, new techniques to interact with these systems have become available. These techniques allow us to increase the effectiveness of current forensic and system defense tools to create new tools to defend or analyze virtualized systems. Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) is one of these techniques that have formed the basis of a number of novel approaches in the field of Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity.

This contradiction points to an ongoing crisis of effectively identifying and understanding what is old and new, the same and different about cyber conflict. The first tendency overemphasizes the new/different aspects of cyber conflict while the second simultaneously overemphasizes the old/same aspects. This essay argues that current contradictory tendencies are unproductive and even potentially dangerous.

The stolen personal information-which includes social security number (SSN), medical records, date of birth, etc.-has been used to launch fraud against individuals and organizations. It already costs billions of dollars in the United States to detect and remediate consequences of security breaches which include identity theft frauds and lawsuits. It is estimated that on an average a company spends $2 million per data breach. With the increase in the rate of breaches, it has become equally important for organizations and individuals to understand the risks and take measures to safeguard personal information. This article investigates data security breaches, which accounted for about 26 million compromised records of personal information in the United States, to present the trends and risks that characterize the security breaches. The article categorizes the incident and loss trends into different dimensions including the industry, victim type, data type, and threats such as stolen computer, hacking and unauthorized access. The research can aid individuals and organizations understand the data breach, trends and evaluate their own risks in handling personal information, which will help them to make better and informed decisions to protect against data breaches. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","data breach; information security; privacy; Security breach; security breach disclosure; stolen laptop",""

Based on studies of how 19 municipalities interpret and implement the information security provisions of the Norwegian Data Protection Act, it is argued that municipal practice can be understood in light of what is defined as a compliance illusion. This implies that the municipalities produce (by means of documentation) an exaggerated image of rulecompliance - an image that does not reflect actual behaviour.

In commitment phase, the code word is transformed based on commitment witness. The information process can resist quantum Fourier sampling attack. Then, we present a quantum hash algorithm. The random qubits are adjusted with diffusion and confusion, and then encrypted by using the random secret key. The security of the process is same as the one-time pad. The proposed scheme can resist the attack of quantum Turing machines. Based on the quantum fuzzy commitment, this paper also gives a quantum challenge-response biometric authentication scheme.

These functions include, but are not limited to, online shopping, online gaming, social networking and online banking. Home users of online banking face multiple threats, such as phishing and social engineering. These threats come from hackers attempting to obtain confidential information, such as online banking authentication credentials, from home users. It is, thus, essential that home users of online banking be made aware of these threats, how to identify them and what countermeasures to implement to protect themselves from hackers. In this respect, information security awareness (ISA) programmes are an effective way of making the home users of online banking aware of both the threats they face and the countermeasures available to protect themselves from these threats. South African banks have to comply with certain legal requirements when implementing information security awareness initiatives. Noncompliance or failure to demonstrate due care and due diligence, should a security incident occur, will result in financial penalties for the bank as well as possible brand damage and loss of customers. Banks implement international best practice recommendations in an effort to comply with legislation. These include recommendations for information security awareness. This research proposes a framework which, predominantly, can be applied when determining and comparing information security best practice recommendations and information security legal requirements for online banking. The primarily aim of this paper is to investigate whether the implementation of best practices are sufficient to comply with legal requirements. A selected list of information security best practices was investigated for best practice recommendations while a selected list of information security legislation was also investigated for legal requirements imposed on South African banks. A gap analysis was performed on both these recommendations and requirements to determine whether the implementation of best practice recommendations results in compliance with legal requirements. The gap analysis found that the implementation of best practice recommendations does not result in compliance with legal requirements. Accordingly, the outcome of this research highlights the importance of applying such a framework in a comprehensive fashion to understand the legal requirements imposed and ensure that adequate controls are in place for achieving compliance. © J.UCS.","Best practice; Home users; Information security awareness; Legislation; Online banking; South Africa",""

We employ a Jackson queueing network modeling framework, which allows both predictable and stochastic variability as well as varied employee skill sets. This framework enables the modeling of internal security threats that emanate from cross-task and cross-personnel assignments and the development of optimal staffing strategies that meet security requirements at minimum operational costs. Our detailed implementation analysis reveals that the model developed is not demanding in terms of required parameters and that the proposed approach is practical and adaptable to evolving business, regulatory, and workforce conditions.

Unlike the previous approaches, we propose to implement nonsystematic coded transmission by scrambling the information bits, and characterize the bit error rate of scrambled transmissions through theoretical arguments and numerical simulations. We have focused on some examples of Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem and low-density parity-check codes to estimate the security gap, which we have used as a measure of physical layer security, in addition to the bit error rate. Based on a number of numerical examples, we found that such a transmission technique can outperform alternative solutions. In fact, when an eavesdropper (Eve) has a worse channel than the authorized user (Bob), the security gap required to reach a given level of security is very small. The amount of degradation of Eve's channel with respect to Bob's that is needed to achieve sufficient security can be further reduced by implementing scrambling and descrambling operations on blocks of frames, rather than on single frames. While Eve's channel has a quality equal to or better than that of Bob's channel, we have shown that the use of a hybrid automatic repeat-request protocol with authentication still allows achieving a sufficient level of security. Finally, the secrecy performance of some practical schemes has also been measured in terms of the equivocation rate about the message at the eavesdropper and compared with that of ideal codes. © 2012 IEEE.","Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) wire-tap channel; Information security; Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes; Physical-layer security; Scrambled transmissions","Additive noise; Bit error rate; Forward error correction; Gaussian noise (electronic); Network layers; Numerical analysis; Security of data; Turbo codes; Wire; Additive White Gaussian noise; Authorized users; Channel code; Coded transmission; Hybrid automatic repeat-request protocol; Information bit; Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes; Numerical example; Physical layer security; Physical-layer securities; Practical schemes; Secure transmission; Security gap; Theoretical arguments; Transmission techniques; White noise"

These complex network architectures have resulted in increased demands of information security measures. Each organization needs to effectively deal with this major security concerns, forming a security policy according to its requirements and objectives. An efficient security policy must be proactive in order to provide sufficient defense layers against a variety of known and unknown attack classes and cases. This proactive approach is usually interpreted wrongly in only up-to-date software and hardware. Regular updates are necessary, although, not enough, because potential mis-configurations and design flaws cannot be located and patched, making the whole network vulnerable to attackers. In this paper we present how a comprehensive security level can be reached through extensive Penetration Tests (Ethical Hacking). We present a Penetration Test methodology and framework capable to expose possible exploitable vulnerabilities in every network layer.

This method makes the reduction of attributes by the importance degree of attribute in one object, and attribute vector is formed. Then, according to formal concept analysis, this method accomplishes comparability analysis of objects in the same secure domain by gravity among concepts so that objects can be aggregated. Finally, according to probability estimate of fuzzy set about secure level of attributes or sets of attribute, probability of higher level information inferred by aggregation of similar objects is computed, which may effectively establish access control policy in multi-level network, and accomplish restricted access of congeneric objects in order to reduce the risk of information system.","Classified security protection; Concept analysis; Information security; Level inference; Object aggregation","Access control; Fuzzy sets; Security of data; Access control policies; Aggregated information; Attribute vectors; Clustering analysis; Concept analysis; Higher-level information; Inference methods; Information leakage; Level inference; Objects-based; Probability estimate; Secure domain; Security protection; Aggregates"

Data mining also opens new threats to privacy and information security if not done or used properly. The main problem is that from non-sensitive data, one is able to infer sensitive information, including personal information, fact or even patterns which are generated by any algorithm of data mining. In order to focusing on privacy preserving association rule mining, the simplistic solution to address the problem of privacy is presented. The solution is to survey different aspects which are discussed in the several research papers and after analyzing those research papers conclude a new solution which is best in efficiency and performance. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm named Cloud Subset Preserving Mining (CSPM).

In order to improve the accuracy of evaluation, a creditability evaluation model based on software behavior trace (CEMSBT) is demonstrated in this paper. We introduce software behavior trace (SBT) to describe the software behavior. Given that the operational process and background of running software are key factors in creditability evaluation, SBT consists of operation trace and function trace. Operation trace is the operation sequences of the running software, which can be denoted by ordered check point vectors; function trace is depicted by a series of scenes which have the ability of characterizing the software functions. With the purpose of reducing the time and space overheads of creditability evaluation, we give reduction rules of SBT. Our model applies identification evaluation rule and scene evaluation rules to check the practical behavior of software. The branch point brings software some randomness which can be used by intruders, so it is necessary to judge which branch will be run next. We propose the scene similarity method to determine the direction of the branch, which can reduce the false negatives. The simulation results indicate the accuracy and efficiency of CEMSBT.","Behavior trace; Check point; Creditability evaluation; Scene; Simplify; Software behavior","Security of data; Behavior trace; Check points; Creditability evaluation; Scene; Simplify; Software behavior; Function evaluation"

The ability to sustain and protect the flow of information and data and the possibility to early detect, isolate and eliminate cyber hazards have become issues of paramount importance when developing the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems of such a CI. The majority of tools dedicated to these goals are based on fully automatic autonomous self-reconfigurable systems that operate within the network, or online. However, the possibility to enable also human intervention for the further reduction in the vulnerability of CIs is equally possible. In this case, the intervention is considered offline and requires the active co-operation between a decision aid tool and a human operator. This paper presents a project aimed at improving robustness and resilience of CIs and discusses in particular the human interfaces associated with the offline tools. In essence, it is found that while the guidelines of the usability principle must be preserved, special account must be given to the type of issues involved and high professionalism of their users. This implies that certain basic criteria of the usability principle may be less relevant and their limitations may not be respected without loosing effectiveness and strength of the tools. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Critical infrastructures; Cybersecurity; Resiliance; Supervisory control and data acquisition systems","Critical infrastructures; Decision support systems; Public works; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Decision aids; Human Interface; Human intervention; Human operator; Offline; Resiliance; Self-reconfigurable systems; SCADA systems"

With so many types of attack to keep track of – Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), industrialised attacks, insider threats, and so on – it has become difficult to clearly delineate between various threat vectors, and most importantly, determine which ones should be of most concern to government and enterprise networks. Emerging trends – including cloud computing, user mobility and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) – have further complicated matters, increasing the attack surface while diminishing the efficacy of traditional perimeter defences. It has become difficult to clearly delineate between all the threats that menace organisations today, or to determine which are of most concern. And new technologies such as cloud and user mobility just complicate matters. Today's threat landscape requires a new level of thinking and preparation when it comes to security. We must think about the various forms of attack in terms of the motivation behind them to determine how best to protect our assets, argues Mike Potts of Lancope. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd","","Safety engineering; Bring your own devices; Cyber-attacks; Emerging trends; Enterprise networks; Insider Threat; Keep track of; User mobility; Network security"

Despite this fact, security is rarely accounted for in hardware design flows. As a result, security holes are often only identified after significant damage has been inflicted. Recently, gate level information flow tracking (GLIFT) has been proposed to verify information flow security at the level of Boolean gates. GLIFT is able to detect all logical flows including hardware specific timing channels, which is useful for ensuring properties related to confidentiality and integrity and can even provide real-time guarantees on system behavior. GLIFT can be integrated into the standard hardware design, testing and verification process to eliminate unintended information flows in the target design. However, generating GLIFT logic is a difficult problem due to its inherent complexity and the potential losses in precision. This paper provides a formal basis for deriving GLIFT logic which includes a proof on the NP-completeness of generating precise GLIFT logic and a formal analysis of the complexity and precision of various GLIFT logic generation algorithms. Experimental results using IWLS benchmarks provide a practical understanding of the computational complexity. © 2012 IEEE.","Algorithm design and analysis; Boolean functions; Computational complexity; Gate level information flow tracking; Information security","Boolean functions; Computational complexity; Security of data; Algorithm design and analysis; Boolean gate; Formal analysis; Gate levels; Generation algorithm; Hardware design; Information flow security; Information flows; Inherent complexity; Logical flow; Malicious activities; Np-completeness; Potential loss; Security holes; Side-channel; Standard hardware; System behaviors; Target design; Timing channels; Verification process; Hardware"

Conventional evaluation methods did not consider the interactivity and inter-influence of the business dataflow, attack flow, and security measures factors when evaluating system's security measures. Thus, they can not ensure the effectiveness of the evaluation process and results. An efficiency evaluating approach for information system's security measures under the given vulnerability set is presented in this paper. It employs colored Petri-Net tools to uniform modeling and simulates the interaction among the system's workflow, attack flow, and security measures. Based on this modeling method, the paper proposes an inter-nodes vulnerabilities exploiting graph generation algorithm and improves Dijkstra algorithm to identify shortest-attack-paths, which can cause damage to the information system's security attributes. Next, it constructs a hierarchical model to evaluate the effectiveness of the security measures and employs a gray multiple attributes decision-making algorithm to choose the best effectiveness-improving alternatives. By using this approach, the dependency on evaluators' subjectivity in the process of the evaluation of information system's security measures can be alleviated. Also, it helps to ensure the consistency and traceability of the evaluation results. Finally, a practical Web business system is taken as a case study to validate the correctness and effectiveness of the evaluation model. © 2012 ISCAS.","Colored Petri net; Efficiency evaluation; Information security measures; Multiple attributes decision-making; Shortest-attack-path","Algorithms; Decision making; Efficiency; Hierarchical systems; Security of data; Attack flow; Business systems; Colored petri net; Colored Petri Nets; Dataflow; Dijkstra algorithms; Efficiency evaluation; Evaluating approach; Evaluation Method; Evaluation models; Evaluation process; Evaluation results; Graph generation; Hierarchical model; Information system security; Interactivity; Multiple attributes decision making; Security attributes; Security measure; Shortest-attack-path; Information systems"

However, privacy issues caused by RFID surface constantly and can impede widespread implementation of RFID. The purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical model to explicate the construct of concern for information privacy (CFIP). Design/methodology/approach: The authors review and synthesize the extant and pertinent literature on RFID and privacy issues. Starting with previous theorization of CFIP, its four constituent dimensions are examined - collection, unauthorized secondary use, improper access, and errors - within the context of RFID-related privacy issues. Findings: The authors situate CFIP within a nomological model, which advances that: awareness of the RFID technology itself, awareness of information security risks entailed by RFID use, and awareness of privacy protective measures are direct antecedent to CFIP; and CFIP directly influences a person's trust in the RFID technology. Social implications: Users' concern about privacy is a major impediment to wide-spread use of RFID. From a societal perspective, the business advantages of RFID technologies should not be gained at the expense of citizens' privacy. This research helps to determine the proper management of privacy issues involved in RFID implementations. Originality/value: Although there has been some technical discussion of privacy protection measures related to RFID, academic theorization of privacy issues at the human-societal level is lacking in comparison. With this paper, the authors contribute to remedying this insufficiency. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Concern for information privacy; Data security; Information security; Privacy; Radio frequency identification; Supply chain management",""

The key feature of layer two virtual private networks is confidentiality. However, L2 VPNs are being rapidly replaced by layer three virtual networks as common carriers expand the roles of their shared IP networks. The recent increase of interest in L3 virtual networks has led to renewed interest and new questions concerning their privacy. We designate virtual network nodes that are undesirable as extrinsic. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm, Message Induced Network Appraisal (MINA), for detecting the presence of extrinsic nodes in virtual networks. MINA is inspired by Kleinberg's HITS algorithm for ranking web pages. The generalization of a HITS derived algorithm to detecting the presence of extrinsic nodes in virtual networks is novel.

To make it more marketable in the wider IT user community one needs to address a variety of information security risks. In this paper, we present an extensive review on cloud computing with the main focus on gaps and security concerns. We identify the top security threats and their existing solutions. We also investigate the challenges/obstacles in implementing threat remediation. To address these issues, we propose a proactive threat detection model by adopting three main goals: (i) detect an attack when it happens, (ii) alert related parties (system admin, data owner) about the attack type and take combating action, and (iii) generate information on the type of attack by analyzing the pattern (even if the cloud provider attempts subreption). To emphasize the importance of monitoring cyber attacks we provide a brief overview of existing literature on cloud computing security. Then we generate some real cyber attacks that can be detected from performance data in a hypervisor and its guest operating systems. We employ modern machine learning techniques as the core of our model and accumulate a large database by considering the top threats. A variety of model performance measurement tools are applied to verify the model attack prediction capability. We observed that the Support Vector Machine technique from statistical machine learning theory is able to identify the top attacks with an accuracy of 97.13%. We have detected the activities using performance data (CPU, disk, network and memory performance) from the hypervisor and its guest operating systems, which can be generated by any cloud customer using built-in or third party software. Thus, one does not have to depend on cloud providers' security logs and data. We believe our line of thoughts comprising a series of experiments will give researchers, cloud providers and their customers a useful guide to proactively protect themselves from known or even unknown security issues that follow the same patterns. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In view of the digital watermarking as a major technology for information security, the paper aims to suggest a watermarking scheme in contourlet transform domain based on moment normalization and matrix singular value decompostion. The scheme is composed of preprocessing, watermark embedding and extracting algorithms. In the first place, the host image is normalized into the one and only standard image to get the low-frequency subband image through Contourlet decompostion. Secondly, the low-frequency subband image is divided to obtain the nonoverlapping subblocks that are further decomposed via discrete cosine transformation (DCT), of which the DC component frames the DC matrix. Finally, the resulted DC matrix is embedded into by the preprocessed watermark through singular value decomposition (SVD). Watermark extracting is an inversion to its embedding. The experiment demonstrates the scheme enjoys satisfying effectiveness in invisibility ,robustness and security. © 2012 Binary Information Press.","Contourlet transform; Digital image watermarking; Image normalization; Singular value decompostion","Security of data; Singular value decomposition; Contourlet transform; Contourlets; Copyright protections; DC components; Digital image watermarking; Digital information; Discrete cosine transformation; Host images; Image normalization; Low frequency; Moment normalization; Nonoverlapping; Singular values; Standard images; Sub-blocks; Subband images; Watermark embedding; Watermarking schemes; Image watermarking"

In a research paper, 'Privacy and cybersecurity: The next 100 years', authors forecast the future of privacy and cybersecurity in the next 10, 20, 50, and 100 years from the perspectives of theory and algorithms, technology, policy, and economics.

We describe how our visualization approach, based on IHMC’s OZ flight display, has been leveraged and extended in our development of the Flow Capacitor, an analyst display for maintaining cyber situation awareness, and in the Parallel Coordinates 3D Observatory (PC3O or Observatory), a generalization of the Flow Capacitor that provides capabilities for developing and exploring lines of inquiry. We then introduce the primary implementation frameworks that provide the core capabilities of Sol: the Luna Software Agent Framework, the VIA Cross-Layer Communications Substrate, and the KAoS Policy Services Framework. We show how policy-governed agents can perform much of the tedious high-tempo tasks of analysts and facilitate collaboration. Much of the power of Sol lies in the concept of coactive emergence, whereby a comprehension of complex situations is achieved through the collaboration of analysts and agents working together in tandem. Not only can the approach embodied in Sol lead to a qualitative improvement in cyber situation awareness, but its approach is equally relevant to applications of distributed sensemaking for other kinds of complex high-tempo tasks. © 2012, The Author(s).","Coactive design; Cyber security; Emergence; Joint activity; Policy management; Resilience; Sensemaking; Software agents; Teamwork","Cybersecurity; Observatories; Software agents; Sols; Three dimensional computer graphics; Agent-based framework; Coactive design; Cyber security; Emergence; Joint activity; Policy management; Resilience; Sense making; Situation awareness; Teamwork; Human resource management"

Transformation matrix which has a big period is one of the basic tools of scrambling and thus is very important in practice. Many works in some literature have been done on investigating transformation matrix. However, up to our knowledge, all known works focused on determining the periods of certain transformation matrices modulo positive integers. Different from any known ideas, the general methods to generate transformation matrices for a given period and a given modulus are studied. The supremum of the period of transformation matrix modulo a power of a given prime is analyzed. The necessary and sufficient conditions when the supremum is reached are also presented. A new algorithm and two improvements on constructing transformation matrix which has the maximum period modulo a power of a prime are proposed. Furthermore, the upper bound of the period of transformation matrix modulo a general integer N is investigated, based on which two algorithms on constructing transformation matrix modulo the given N using Chinese Remainder Theorem are designed. The result of the former one has maximum period, while those of the latter one have foreseeable periods.","Digital image; Information security; Period; Scrambling; Transformation matrix","Algorithms; Matrix algebra; Security of data; Chinese remainder theorem; Digital image; Digital image encryption; General method; Integer-N; Modulo-N; Period; Positive integers; Scrambling; Sufficient conditions; Supremum; Transformation matrices; Transformation technologies; Upper Bound; Linear transformations"

Using the coding method and properties of quantum LDPC codes CSS(C 1, C 2) for secure communication across the Wire-tap channel in the BB84 protocol is an equivalent proof of the security of BB84 protocol.

Cryptography is the largely built in computer hardware or in software using various discrete structure. Security is, thus, merging in network with cryptography to provide secure communication between trusted and/or untrusted network. Efficient mechanism of encryption process is a primary method of protecting valuable electronic information. The encryption process also needs to be dynamic in order to face new hazards and advance methods used by cryptanalysts. RC4 is one of the most popular and efficient stream ciphers [1]. Stream ciphers are often used in applications where high speed and low delay are a requirement. This paper proposes to identify the security requirements for data stream systems; according to the increasing order of robustness. Various security circumstances demand various degree of security robustness. This paper suggests to develop a family of cryptographic algorithm based on the RC4 and checks on the performance of each one to analyze the robustness so that the particular algorithm becomes readily applicable to a circumstance. The applicability of algorithm is totally governed by the requirement of robustness for the security concern of the circumstance. The security concern of robustness of circumstances is matched against the designed ciphersuites where such family of algorithms is available. The process of selection of ciphersuites and hence the cryptographic algorithm is automated in order to ensure appropriate circumstantial robustness. This analysis shows that, the full-size RC4 remains secure against known attacks [2]. The family of algorithm considered here is based on RC4. The basic RC4 algorithm and its variants suggested by different authors like RC4 KSA [3], RC4-PRGA are included in the family. In order enhance the degree of security robustness, two new algorithm S-RC41 and S-RC42 are proposed. Addition of variants of RC4 increases the range of automatic selection ensuring further enhancement in security. RC4 family is analyzed for encryption, decryption and algorithm strength is analyzed. Robustness is determined considering both the factors; speed of encryption/decryption or performance and algorithm strength. It is proposed to evaluate the effect of existing RC4 changing different parameters.","Ciphersuite; RC4; S-RC4; Secure Socket Layer","Access control; Algorithms; Communication; Systems analysis; Access control mechanism; Automated selection; Automatic selection; Ciphersuite; Cryptographic algorithms; Datastream Systems; Discrete structure; Electronic information; Encryption and decryption; Encryption/decryption; Low delay; RC4; RC4 algorithm; S-RC4; Secure communications; Secure Socket Layer; Security requirements; Stream Ciphers; Untrusted network; Cryptography"

The protocol can provide higher eavesdropping error-rates than the well-known existing QKD protocols like BB84 [4] and B92 [5].

Information security has traditionally been ensured with data encryption and authentication techniques. Through the years, different generic data encryption standards have been developed. The secrecy of communication is maintained by secret key exchange. In effect the strength of the algorithm depends solely on the length of the key. The presented work aims at secure image transmission using randomness in encryption algorithm, thereby creating more confusion to obtain the original data. The security of the original cipher has been enhanced by addition of impurities to misguide the cryptanalyst. Since the encryption process is one way function, the artificial neural networks are best suited for this purpose as they possess features like high security, no distortion and its ability to perform for non linear input-output characteristics, In the presented work the need for key exchange is also eliminated, which is otherwise a perquisite for most of the algorithms used today. The proposed work finds its application in medical imaging systems, military image database communication and confidential video conferencing, and similar such application.

Particularly, buffer overflow has become one of the best-known software security vulnerabilities. In terms of source code, software security vulnerabilities can be caused in two ways, data-copy-related and format-control-string-related function calls. This paper summarizes the common functions which are prone to risk buffer overflows, and introduces an algorithm of how to compute the length of formatted string variables when calling the formatted input/output functions. It also proposes a method of buffer overflow detection based on static code analysis. The detection method models the source code firstly by creating its abstract syntax tree, symbol table, control flow graph and function call graph. Based on these models, the value range of variables and expressions in each program point is computed by interval calculation, and when encountering a function call, the function's summary is applied as a stand-in for the function. This method is scalable by allowing user to add functions under test in configure files. Experiments on open source project show that it would detect buffer overflow efficiently, and its output has both a lower false positive rate and a lower false negative rate than another testing tool, Klocwork K8.","Buffer overflow; Function summary; Interval calculation; Security vulnerabilities; Static analysis","Buffer storage; Data flow analysis; Static analysis; XML; Abstract Syntax Trees; Buffer overflows; Control flow graphs; Detection methods; False negative rate; False positive rates; Function calls; Input/output function; Open source projects; Program points; Security vulnerabilities; Software security; Source codes; Static code analysis; Testing tools; Security of data"

The major motivations to adopt Cloud services include no upfront investment on infrastructure and transferring responsibility of maintenance, backups, and license management to Cloud Providers. However, one of the key challenges that holds businesses from adopting Cloud computing services is that, by migrating to Cloud, they move some of their information and services out of their direct control. Their main concern is how well the Cloud providers keep their information (security) and deliver their services (performance). To cope with this challenge, several service level agreement management systems have been proposed. However, monitoring service deployment as a major responsibility of those systems have not been deeply investigated yet. Therefore, this paper shows how monitoring services have to be described, deployed (discovered and ranked), and then how they have to be executed to enforce accurate penalties by eliminating service level agreement failure cascading effects on violation detection.

In this paper, GDEC, a frame for clustering non convex shapes with outliers based on grid and density approach, is proposed to fulfill the requirements presented above. The algorithm uses an online component to map each data record to a grid, and an offline component to cluster. Density decay technique is adopted to reflect the aging of data records.

The methodology involves an extraction of iris features using directional empirical mode decomposition (DEMD) and fractal dimension. After the preprocessing procedure, the normalized effective iris image is decomposed into different 2D intrinsic mode function (IMF) components according to different frequency by the directional empirical mode decomposition.

The proposed framework is composed of two major parts: PISC key management and PISC security service coordination. In PISC key management, the smartphone manages the public key exchange between different users' smartphones. The key exchange utilizes a human-perceivable video channel to transfer keys and utilizes the phone camera to create an undeniable cryptographic nonce for key verification. A PISC phone also acts as a coordinator to provide keychain synchronization, authentication, and confidentiality services to all the user's devices.

Those information systems usually take the form of workflow systems. Due to the large social impact of e-government systems, computer security plays a pivotal role in ensuring its efficiency and effectiveness. Access control is one of the key aspects of computer security. Current access control models do not take into account the context of the system and its environment. In this article, we argue that a formal context-sensitive access control model can improve the development of e-government workflow systems and present a particular context-sensitive access control model. The subject of the article is a specification of the context-sensitive access control model for business processes (COBAC). By using a context-sensitive access control, it is possible to define more sophisticated access control policies that cannot be implemented by existing access control models. The COBAC's context is modeled using Web Ontology Language (OWL) in order to provide formal representation of context, rich representation of diverse contextual information, semantic interoperability between various context-aware systems, and a high degree of inference making. The presented model is applicable in different e-government systems, and supports the definition of access control policies for both simple and complex business processes. The model's prototype is verified by a case study on a real e-government business process-the national petty offense trial proceedings. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","access control; context-sensitive; e-government; information security; judicial process; OWL; RBAC; workflow",""

The least privilege principle is a very important constraint policy of RBAC. Devising a complete and correct set of roles for supporting the least privilege principle has been recognized as one of the most important tasks in implementing RBAC. A key problem is how to find such sets of roles which have the least permissions. In fact, when the number of role-permission assignments is large, it is almost impossible to find a rigorous set of roles which has the completely same set of permissions required by a user. To address this problem, we research the problem how to find such the rigorous combinations obeying the principle of least permissions. By bringing forward the concept of the least privilege mining problem, we describe the methods to resolve the problem and some instances of its applications, too. Moreover, the corresponding algorithms are displayed. Specially, by analyzing the complexity of least privilege mining problem, the method based on evolutionary algorithm is shown appreciate.

Face Recognition Technology has diverse potential over applications in the fields of information security, law enforcement and surveillance, smart cards, access control and more. Face recognition is one of the diverse techniques used for identifying an individual. Generally the image variations because of the change in face identity are less than the variations among the images of the same face under different illumination and viewing angle. Illumination and pose are the two major challenges, among the several factors that influence face recognition. After pose and illumination, the main factors that affect the face recognition performance are occlusion and expression. So in order to overcome these issues, we proposed an efficient face recognition system based on partial occlusion and expression. The similar blocks in the face image are identified and occlusion can be recovered using the block matching technique. This is combined with expression normalized by calculating the Empherical Mode Decomposition feature. Finally, the face can be recognized by using the PCA. From the implementation result, it is evident that our proposed method based on the PCA technique recognizes the face images effectively. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.","block matching algorithm; expression; Face recognition; occlusion detection; principal component analysis (PCA)","Access control; Biometrics; Computer graphics; Computer vision; Principal component analysis; Smart cards; Biometric identifications; Biometric methods; Block Matching; Block matching algorithms; Diverse techniques; expression; Face images; Face recognition performance; Face recognition systems; Face recognition technologies; Image variations; Mode decomposition; Occlusion detection; Partial occlusions; Viewing angle; Face recognition"

Design/methodology/approach: Using the authors' autonomous computer system, the cost/benefits of five different disaster recovery (DR) models are determined and reported in a table. Further, experimental data gleaned from a series of data updates on remote replicas connected via the internet are reported. Findings: The results indicate that the traditional models lack performance flexibility. The virtualized replica model and the outsourced solution are similar in terms of investment cost, but the former offers attractive performance and sound reliability characteristics, and provided adequate network bandwidth. The minimum practical speed to support replication updates in the authors' autonomous system was 10 Mbs. Research limitations/implications: The results herein are only directly applicable to a system with characteristics similar to the authors' autonomous system. However, the results do provide a general trend one would expect to carry across a wide variety of autonomous systems. Originality/value: The primary value of this paper is the evaluation of several DR models in relationship to a live data centre. Each model is evaluated with regard to its cost, complexity, recovery time capabilities, and replication characteristics. While the models themselves are not new, the data puts ""a face"" on them and provides the reader with the degree of difference among the models. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Data center; Data management; Data security; Disaster recovery; Disasters; Information security; Recovery planning",""

In applications in multi-user communication environments, a user may want to sign a document such that only some specified parties can confirm the signature. To do so, the signer can generate many designated-verifier signatures on a document for various designated verifiers, or she/he signs the document, encrypts the signature, and then sends the encrypted messages to the specified parties. However, the signer has to generate multiple signatures, as determined by the numbers of the designated verifiers in the former method and the latter method, signs a document and then encrypts it, that could lose their designation (which phenomenon is called source hiding). To solve the above problems, this study proposes an attribute-based strong designated-verifier signature scheme with source hiding, such that a signer needs to generate only one signature for a group of designated verifiers with attributes at specified values.

The approach of this paper is both a meta-study of the flaws in the technological specifications as well as the social implementation of RFID/biometric passports. Finland is used as a case, but the results extend beyond Finland in most, if not all the topics presented – not necessarily all results to all implementations, but all to some others. The current implementations of RFID/biometric passports are lacking in both technical and social implementations and pose clear risks to their use, both due to lax implementation of the technology itself but specifically due to the social changes brought about. These problems cause both erosion of privacy and trust. Further research into other potential social implications on a national level is required. The authors fear that the cases presented do not necessarily reflect all the potential problems, but just the most evident ones. The problems with the technological implications can be averted by using the best technological solutions, and thus the best technological solutions should be used instead of the ones proven to be lacking. The social implications should at least be brought forth for public discourse and acknowledged, which currently does not seem to happen. The paper contributes to the understanding of problems with current RFID/biometric passport implementations as well as inherent social problems that are hard, if not impossible to avoid. The problems belong under the category of critical eGovernment applications, and similar issues are visible in other eGovernment applications. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Biodata; Biometric identification; Biometrics; Data security; eGovernment; Finland; Function creep; Information security; Information systems; Passports; Privacy; Radio frequency identification; Trust",""

Encryption is the most widely used technique used to scramble the data that is being transmitted over the network from sender to a receiver. The encryption algorithms are available practically and provide the security for user data and information.This paper presents an advanced encryption technique which combines the features of substitution and transposition. Five different key values being used in this algorithms and each key value is used to substitute the corresponding plaintext characters in association with addition operation. Each key value is twice as that of the previous one. The basic key value is a fixed one defined by the user. The transposition technique is employed by left shifting each bit of the data. The shifted data is complemented to alter the each bit of the cipher text that is being generated.

The modernization of the grid to accommodate today's uses is leading to the incorporation of information processing capabilities for power system controls and operations monitoring. The ""Smart Grid"" is the name given to the evolving electric power network as new information technology systems and capabilities are incorporated. While these new components may add to the ability to control power flows and enhance the efficiency of grid operations, they also potentially increase the susceptibility of the grid to cyber (i.e., computer-related) attack since they are built around microprocessor devices whose basic functions are controlled by software programming. The potential for a major disruption or widespread damage to the nation's power system from a large scale cyberattack has increased focus on the cybersecurity of the Smart Grid. Federal efforts to enhance the cybersecurity of the electrical grid were emphasized with the recognition of cybersecurity as a critical issue for electric utilities in developing the Smart Grid. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) received primary responsibility for the reliability of the bulk power system from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. FERC subsequently designated the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as the ""Electric Reliability Organization"" (ERO) with the responsibility of establishing and enforcing reliability standards. Compliance with reliability standards for electric utilities thus changed from a voluntary, peer-driven undertaking to a mandatory function. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) later added requirements for ""a reliable and secure electricity infrastructure"" with regard to Smart Grid development. NERC is also responsible for standards for critical infrastructure protection (CIP) which focus on planning and procedures for the physical security of the grid. Self-determination is a key part of the CIP reliability process. Utilities are allowed to self-identify what they see as ""critical assets"" under NERC regulations. Only ""critical cyber assets"" (i.e., as essential to the reliable operation of critical assets) are subject to CIP standards. FERC has directed NERC to revise the standards so that some oversight of the identification process for critical cyber assets was provided, but any revision is again subject to stakeholder approval. While reliability standards are mandatory, the ERO process for developing regulations is somewhat unusual in that the regulations are essentially being established by the entities who are being regulated. This may potentially be a conflict of interest, especially when cost of compliance is a concern, and acceptable standards may conceivably result from the option with the lowest costs. Since utility systems are interconnected in many ways, the system with the least protected network potentially provides the weakest point of access. Cybersecurity threats represent a constantly moving and increasing target for mitigation activities and mitigation efforts could likewise spiral upward in costs. Recovery of costs may present a major challenge especially to distribution utilities and state commissions charged with overseeing utility costs. EISA only requires states to consider recovery of costs related to Smart Grid systems. FERC has jurisdiction over the bulk power grid, and cannot compel entities involved in distribution to comply with its regulations. Recoverability from a cyber attack on the scale of something which could take down a significant portion of the grid will likely be very difficult, but maintaining a ready inventory of critical spare parts in close proximity to key installations could quicken recovery efforts from some types of attack. The electricity grid is connected to (and largely dependent on) the natural gas pipeline, water supply, and telecommunications systems. Technologies being developed for use by the Smart Grid could also be used by these industries. Consideration could be given to applying similar control system device and system safeguards to these other critical utility systems. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Due to the rapid growth of computer networks, many network environments have been becoming multi-server based. Recently, much research has been focused on proposing remote password authentication schemes based on smart cards for securing multi-server environments. Each of these schemes used either a nonce or a timestamp technique to prevent the replay attack. However, using the nonce technique to withstand the replay attack is potentially susceptible to the man-in-the-middle attack. Alternatively, when employing the timestamp method to secure remote password authentication, it will require the cost of implementing clock synchronization. In order to solve the above two issues, this paper proposes a self-verified timestamp technique to help the smart-card-based authentication scheme not only effectively achieve password-authenticated key agreement but also avoid the difficulty of implementing clock synchronization in multi-server environments. A secure authenticated key agreement should accomplish both mutual authentication and session key establishment. Therefore, in this paper we further give the formal proof on the execution of the proposed authenticated key agreement scheme. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - The concepts of bounded rationality, mental models and the extended parallel processing model are examined in an information security context. Findings - There is a lack of formal methodologies in information security awareness for systematically identifying audience communication requirements. Problems with human behaviour in an information security context are assumed to be caused by a lack of facts available to the audience. Awareness, therefore, is largely treated as the broadcast of facts to an audience in the hope that behaviour improves. There is a tendency for technical experts in the field of information security to tell people what they think they ought to know (and may in fact already know). This ""technocratic"" view of risk communication is fundamentally flawed and has been strongly criticised by experts in safety risk communications as ineffective and inefficient. Practical implications - The paper shows how the approach to information security awareness can be improved using knowledge from the safety field.

A novel secure encryption method for image hiding is presented in this paper. The proposed method provides good confusion and diffusion properties that ensures high security due to mixing the two Boolean operations: XOR and Rotation that are done on the bits of the pixels in the image. This method is implemented by firstly doing a sequential XOR operation on all the bits of pixels in the image, and secondly makes a circular rotate right of these bits. These two operations are repeated many times during the encryption phase. The security and performance of the proposed encryption method have been evaluated by applying it on images and analyze the recorded results using key space analysis, key sensitivity analysis, and statistical analysis. The performance experiments show that the proposed method is promising to use effectively in wide fields of image encryption.","Confusion; Cryptography; Diffusion; Information security; Rotation; XOR","Diffusion; Image processing; Pixels; Rotation; Security of data; Boolean operations; Confusion; Diffusion properties; Encryption methods; Image encryptions; Image hiding; Image security; Information hiding; Performance experiment; Security and performance; Space analysis; Wide field; XOR; XOR operation; Cryptography"

To address this gap, we integrated habit (a routinized form of past behavior) with Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), to explain compliance. An empirical test showed that habitual IS security compliance strongly reinforced the cognitive processes theorized by PMT, as well as employee intention for future compliance. We also found that nearly all components of PMT significantly impacted employee intention to comply with IS security policies.

It is widely acknowledged that an organisation's employees are the weakest link in the protection of the organisation's information assets. Most current approaches towards addressing this human problem focus on awareness and educational activities and do not necessarily view the problem from a holistic viewpoint. Combating employee apathy and motivating employees to see information security as their problem is often not adequately addressed by ""isolated"" awareness activities. The purpose of this paper is to show how employee apathy towards information security can be addressed through the use of existing theory from the social sciences. Design/methodology/approach - By means of a literature study, three key organizational environments that could exist are identified and explored. Goal-setting theory is then investigated. Finally, arguments are presented to show how goal-setting theory could be used to actively foster an organizational environment in which employees will view their roles and responsibilities towards information security as ITprosocial/IT behaviour. Findings - The work in the paper is primarily of a conceptual nature. However, the authors believe that encouraging such ITprosocial/IT behaviour could contribute towards an organizational culture of information security. Originality/value - The paper examines the motivation of employees to actively contribute towards information security from an organisational science perspective.

This paper chooses energy imagery for the reason that it is less sensitive to the ambient temperature. What's more, for the characteristic of energy concentration in wavelet transform, we can reduce the data complexity based on face recognition in wavelet domain.

However, the identification of risks the cloud computing faces also mix with traditional security problems. In this paper, we aim at identifying the critical security issues which are cloud computing-designated. The results of our identification are divided into three categories, namely, policy and organizational, technical, and legal issues, which were adopted by ENISA. We also carefully analyzed the literature on cloud computing security to identify critical cloud computing-designated risk items for each category. Detailed explanations about how the risk items were identified as the critical cloud computing-designated ones are also given to show the adequacy of the proposed identifications.

Therefore, in this paper, we first do a forensic analysis of Linux executable and linkable format (ELF) files. Our forensic analysis provides insight into different features that have the potential to discriminate malicious executables from benign ones. As a result, we can select a features' set of 383 features that are extracted from an ELF headers. We quantify the classification potential of features using information gain and then remove redundant features by employing preprocessing filters. Finally, we do an extensive evaluation among classical rule-based machine learning classifiers-RIPPER, PART, C4.5 Rules, and decision tree J48-and bio-inspired classifiers-cAnt Miner, UCS, XCS, and GAssist-to select the best classifier for our system. We have evaluated our approach on an available collection of 709 Linux malware samples from vx heavens and offensive computing.

To evade detection, malware (unwanted malicious piece of code) is packed, encrypted, and obfuscated to produce variants that continue to plague properly defended and patched systems and networks with zero day exploits. Zero day exploits are used by the attackers to compromise victims computer before the developer of the target software knows about the vulnerability. In this chapter we present a method of functionally classifying malicious code that might lead to automated attacks and intrusions using computational intelligent techniques and similarity measures. We study the performance of kernel methods in the context of robustness and generalization capabilities of malware classification. Results from our recent experiments indicate that similarity measures can be utilized to determine the likelihood that a piece of code or binary under inspection contains a particular malware. Malware variants of a particular malware family show very high similarity scores (over 85%). Interestingly Trojans and hacking tools have high similarity scores with other Trojans and hacking tools. Our results also show that malware analysis based on the API calling sequence and API frequency that reflects the behavior of a particular piece of code gives good accuracy to classify malware. We also show that classification accuracy varies with the kernel type and the parameter values; thus, with appropriately chosen parameter values, malware can be detected by support vector machines (SVM) with higher accuracy and lower rates of false alarms. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","",""

This paper investigates how EM information leakage changes with the configuration of information hardware, focusing on the frequency characteristics of the hardware. We assume that frequency characteristics of the EM radiation correspond to physical aspects of the hardware configuration.

As such, many software engineering and computer science programs offer an elective course in software security. While the title of these courses is often similar, the content is often vastly different, reflecting the large domain of software security. Certain aspects of security appeal to practitioners, certain aspects appeal to Computer Scientists, and certain aspects apply MIS personnel. In order to provide a holistic view of computer security, software engineering students need to have exposure to all three aspects. Thus, for software engineering students, a single course in security can be inadequate. To combat this problem, the Milwaukee School of Engineering has developed a three course sequence in software security targeting the multi-disciplinary problem of security. While each of the three courses addresses software security, each course targets a different aspect. An Introduction to Network Security offers students an understanding of the nature of network security. Secure Software Development focuses the design and construction of software systems in a manner in which security is built into the product from the beginning of development. Information Security offers students an understanding of the techniques used to ensure that data and other systemic information is protected using the most appropriate techniques. Since the development of this sequence, one or more of these courses has been taken by approximately 100 students in the software or computer engineering programs. This article provides an overview of the three courses offered at Milwaukee School of Engineering, the challenges of offering these courses as independent electives, and student impressions of the security course series. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.","","Computer software; Curricula; Engineering education; Network security; Product design; Software design; Teaching; Ubiquitous computing; Computer science programs; Computing devices; Elective course; Engineering and computer science; Milwaukee school of engineerings; Multi-disciplinary approach; Networks security; Software engineering students; Software security; Teaching software; Students"

We propose the image communication systems to secure the information by using a steganographic system and empirical mode decomposition method. The concealed message between the sender and receiver is important in the steganographic system. The encrypted message is further decomposed by using the empirical mode decomposition. The information is transmitted via the public channel and secure channel. At the receiver side the weak message can be retrieved back effectively. The retrieved message carries the same characteristics as the original message. Simulation results have confirmed that this combination model is highly robust against various signal processing operations and geometric attacks. The system increases the security of information data given a variety of constraints and conditions. Our methods have been proven effective for application in various fields which require secure communication, such as mobile telephone, internet and others. By means of this method, researchers can better understand the characteristics of the secure communication.","Empirical mode decomposition; Secure communication; Steganography","Communication systems; Computer simulation; Image communication systems; Innovation; Internet; Signal processing; Steganography; Combination models; Communication security; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Empirical mode decomposition method; Encrypted messages; Geometric attacks; Information exchanges; Internet technology; Mobile telephones; Processing operations; Rapid development; Secure channels; Secure communication; Secure communications; Steganographic system; Security of data"

While increasing incidents of information security breaches have generated extensive publicity, previous studies repeatedly expose low levels of managerial awareness and commitment, a key obstacle to achieving a good information security posture. The main motivation of our study emanates from this phenomenon that the increased vulnerability to information security breaches is coupled with the low level of managerial awareness and commitment regarding information security threats. We report this dissonance by addressing a cognitive bias called optimistic bias. Using a survey, we study if MIS executives are subject to such a bias in their vulnerability perceptions of information security. We find that they demonstrate optimistic bias in risk perception on information security domain. The extent of this optimistic bias is greater with a distant comparison target with fewer information sharing activities. This optimistic bias is also found to be related to perception of controllability with information security threats. In order to overcome the effects of optimistic bias, firms need more security awareness training and systematic treatments of security threats instead of relying on ad hoc approach to security measure implementation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the distributed set of databases residing in computers around the world that contain address numbers mapped to corresponding domain names, making it possible to send and receive messages and to access information from computers anywhere on the Internet. Many of the technical, operational, and management decisions regarding the DNS can have significant impacts on Internet-related policy issues such as intellectual property, privacy, Internet freedom, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. The DNS is managed and operated by a not-for-profit public benefit corporation called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Because the Internet evolved from a network infrastructure created by the Department of Defense, the U.S. government originally owned and operated (primarily through private contractors) the key components of network architecture that enable the domain name system to function. A 1998 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between ICANN and the Department of Commerce (DOC) initiated a process intended to transition technical DNS coordination and management functions to a private-sector not-for-profit entity. While the DOC played no role in the internal governance or day-to-day operations of the DNS, ICANN remained accountable to the U.S. government through the MOU, which was superseded in 2006 by a Joint Project Agreement (JPA). On September 30, 2009, the JPA between ICANN and DOC expired and was replaced by an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC), which provides for review panels to periodically assess ICANN processes and activities. Additionally, a contract between DOC and ICANN authorizes the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to perform various technical functions such as allocating IP address blocks, editing the root zone file, and coordinating the assignment of unique protocol numbers. Currently, negotiations are ongoing over the renewal of the IANA contract between DOC and ICANN, which is due to expire on March 31, 2012. With the expiration of the ICANN-DOC Joint Project Agreement on September 30, 2009, the announcement of the new AoC, and the renewal of the IANA contract, the 112th Congress and the administration are likely to continue assessing the appropriate federal role with respect to ICANN and the DNS, and examine to what extent ICANN is positioned to ensure Internet stability and security, competition, private and bottom-up policymaking and coordination, and fair representation of the global Internet community. Meanwhile, controversies over new generic top level domains (gTLDs) and the addition of the .xxx domain have led some governments to criticize the ICANN policymaking process and to suggest various ways to increase governmental influence over that process. How these and other issues are ultimately addressed and resolved could have profound impacts on the continuing evolution of ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this study, we present a careful examination of the issue of account compromise at two large academic institutions.

For this, staggered lists of IT security measurements are constructed (Guttman scales) whereas the Code of Practice ISO/IEC 27002 provides the objectives and recommendations relating to information security management in this regard. The FMEA approach finally structures the overall risk analysis process. A questionnaire/survey design using this ""Best Practice FMEA"" enables the analyst to represent the results in the form of matrices of measurements with regard to the Code's Objectives improving statistical analysis and validity. In this paper, the statistical evaluation process uses k-means. This is a nonhierarchical clustering method which is compared with hierarchical clustering methods. With regard to applicability, the k-means approach is found easier to implement at (small and medium-sized) enterprises. The representation of results is more comprehensive for complex data bases. Apart from that, both clustering methods are equivalent as they group the Objectives in the same way. The results of a literature research show the placement of Best Practice FMEA among other IT risk assessment approaches, e.g. CRAMM and OCTAVE-S. Comparison criteria are derived from the ISO/IEC-Guide 73. It becomes apparent that Best Practice FMEA is most applicable at small-scale enterprises which are not fully covered by the other approaches. The paper finally shows the transfer of the previous paper-based approach into the novel web based tool ITRA:GUST. The concepts of tool design and software architecture are presented. The closing remarks summarise and reason the method development of Best Practice FMEA and ITRA:GUST. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.","","Cluster analysis; Industry; Reliability; Risk management; Security of data; Software architecture; Analysis process; Assessment approaches; Check-lists; Clustering methods; Code of practice; Complex data; Guttman scaling; Hierarchical clustering methods; Information security managements; ISO/IEC; IT infrastructures; IT security; K-means; Method development; Statistical evaluation; Tool designs; Web-based tools; Risk assessment"

Establishing an efficient investigation and prosecution system is important to deter criminals from further exacerbating this unsatisfactory situation. This paper discusses issues of cybercrime investigation and prosecution across the Taiwan Strait. Based on interview data collected in 2008 and 2009, in both China and Taiwan, this paper concludes that the current manpower dedicated to cybercrime investigation is insufficient. In addition, there is insufficient incentive to attract investigators to devote their time to cybercrime investigation, and prosecutors and judges' knowledge of cybercrime and information security is lacking. Informal relations, such as Guan-xi and Mo-chi, may help in mutual cooperation between crime investigation agencies. However, these rely heavily on the political situation existing at any one time, and can only be effective when relations between Taiwan and China are not tense. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cybercrime investigation; special political situation; Taiwan and China","China; computer; crime; cybercrime; human relation; Internet; manpower; politics; review; Taiwan"

As a consequence, there is a paucity of robust explanatory or predictive models that are tuned for the peculiarities of the ""cyber"" challenge, either to organisations, or, at a higher level, the nation state. The effect of this is that the base arguments for information security business cases are often weak or flawed; as a result, there is an argument that both organisations and nation states will therefore tend to underinvest in information security. To improve this position, there would be benefits for information security, as a profession adopting economic models used in other areas of endeavour that historically have suffered similar problems. One potential model is full-cost accounting. However, there are a number of further implications.

The promise of Digital Rights Management (DRM) has yet to be realized and knowledgeable analysts opine that it may never be achievable. It will certainly need copious amounts of specialized software and maybe even specialized hardware before information assurance can be satisfied. We do not rely on DRM technologies at this point, but reserve the right to review future developments in this area. None-the-less, there exists a need for an assured content delivery process for enterprise authoritative documentation. We propose a process of culling the authoritative information and placing it in an authoritative content repository.

The existence of the information asset and related information assets may be obtained from search engines or other references.

In spite of potential benefits, the adoption of advanced IT among small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is low in India. There are several technological, economical and organizational factors that enable or inhibit the adoption of advanced IT. The primary objective of this research is to identify and evaluate the key factors that are enabling or inhibiting adoption of advanced IT in the Indian auto ancillary SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: In order to identify and evaluate the enablers and inhibitors, a detailed survey was carried out among registered Indian auto ancillary SMEs during 2010. Out of 584 registered SMEs, 110 owners/top managers of the SMEs responded to the survey. The data collected through the survey were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and multivariate regression to evaluate the influence of enablers and inhibitors of advanced IT adoption by the auto ancillary SMEs. Findings: The survey findings show that the level of advanced IT adoption in auto ancillaries is low with only 17 per cent of SMEs having adopted technologies. This study reveals that ""perceived benefits"" and ""perceived competitive pressure"" enable advanced IT adoption among auto ancillary SMEs in India. However, ""lack of financial capacity"", ""small scale operation and ""lack of in-house IT manpower"" inhibit the adoption. It is also found that enablers such as ""changes in business environment"", ""IT experience of CEO/owner"" and ""increased information linkage with OEM/customer"" do not have any influence on the adoption. Similarly in the case of inhibitors, ""lack of IT Infrastructure"" and ""lack of information security"" do not have significant association with IT adoption. Despite the positive external IT environment and recognition of benefits, advanced IT adoption by SMEs in the auto ancillaries is limited by lack of financial capabilities and in-house IT human resources. Originality/value: This is one of the early papers that brings out the enablers and inhibitors of advanced IT adoption by auto ancillaries in India. Further, these factors are systematically analyzed to assess the relative importance with reference to the SMEs. The findings contribute to theory of IT adoption among SMEs, but more importantly to the SMEs in the auto ancillary, and policy makers and IT service providers who are likely to facilitate increased adoption. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advanced IT adoption; Auto ancillaries; Enablers; India; Inhibitors; Small to medium-sized enterprises",""

Therefore, it proposes an empirical analysis which was conducted to identify the antecedents of the information security maturity (ISM) of an organization; and to clarify the relationship between ISM and the social and technical factors identified. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quantitative approach, convenience sampling and the required data collected from 970 key players' managers in information security, in a total of 722 government agencies, through a self-administrated survey. Research adopted the Wallace et al. process to develop and validate the study's instrument. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights and reveals a number of underlying dimensions of social factors and one technical factor. The risk management was found to be the formal coping mechanism adopted in the MPS organizations and is the leading factor towards ISM. The social factors have the most influence on MPS organizations' ISM. Findings demonstrate that two independent variables, risk management and individual perception, discriminate between those organizations that have high and low ISM. Research limitations/implications: The research results may lack generalization; therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further in a different context. Practical implications: The paper includes implications for the development of a powerful instrument in explaining the ISM. Moreover, it helps internal stakeholders of an organization to formulate a more appropriate policy or give a more effective focus on issues that are really relevant to MPS information security management.

True, there have been various methods, approaches and algorithms proposed in the past and will emerge in future too in the areas of secure information transmission. Cryptography and steganography have been primary sources for information security. The bird's eye view on the literature pertaining to the above mentioned two giants of information security spots a number of algorithms developed on both software as well as hardware platforms.

The internet intrusion may lead to terrible disaster for network users. It is therefore imperative to detect the network attacks to protect the information security. However, the intrusion detection rate is often affected by the structure parameters of the fuzzy neural network (FNN). Improper FNN model design may result in a low detection precision. To overcome these problems, a new network intrusion detection approach based on improved genetic algorithm (GA) and FNN is proposed in this chapter. The improved GA used energy entropy to select individuals to optimize the training procedure of the FNN, and satisfactory FNN model with proper structure parameters was then attained. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the practical data. The experiment results show that the proposed approach offers a good intrusion detection rate, and performs better than the standard GA-FNN method with respect to the detection rate. Thus, the proposed new intrusion detection method is efficient for practice applications. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","FNN; Improved genetic algorithm; Intrusion detection","Computer crime; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Internet; Detection rates; Energy-entropy; FNN; FNN models; Improved GA; Improved genetic algorithms; Internet intrusions; Intrusion detection method; Intrusion detection models; Network attack; Network intrusion detection; Network intrusions; Network users; Structure parameter; Training procedures; Intrusion detection"

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the required framework and the prerequisites for planning and implementing an effective and efficient RM system are presented and a literature review and empirical studies are used to depict the interaction between good governance and RM. Findings - The following conclusions are derived from the bibliographic data analysis. Specific training by RM professionals for recordkeeping is useful for public servants. All levels of the administrative chain should be trained and involved in RM processes. Good governance, information security and RM are all deeply connected. The tendency of regarding archives only as cultural thesaurus or valuable historical resources and not also as products and assets of their originating organizations has to be abandoned. Electronic RM and preservation is a complex matter that requires interdisciplinary action in order to be resolved. Technology and computers are not the panacea of records keeping and information management problems in governmental institutions. Institutional capacity and top-level support are two elements, plus technology that enhances change management, work flow, standardization and interoperability. Practical implications - Top management of the public (and private sector) has to be persuaded that there is cost reduction and effectiveness through the implementation of RMS. Public administration needs to turn to records and archives management professionals and involve them in the legislative, planning and operating work regarding the information management and its influence on good governance in public organizations. Social implications - Governments have to set and apply a comprehensive strategy for records and archives management, meaning the physical and intellectual control over all records created and held in public administration. Citizens should be always informed on their rights to access and use of governmental information. Only responsible and informed citizens can demand transparency and accountability by governments. Originality/value - Through this work one can identify the major key issues and problems in planning and implementing a strategy for the creation and management of public records in governments. The most important goal is to raise awareness amongst all participants for emerging legal, fiscal and administrative issues involved with managing governmental information. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Projecting as an evolutionary step, following the transition from mainframe computers to client/server deployment models, cloud computing encompasses elements from grid computing, utility computing and autonomic computing, into an innovative deployment architecture. This rapid transition towards the clouds, has fuelled concerns on a critical issue for the success of information systems, communication and information security. From a security perspective, a number of unchartered risks and challenges have been introduced from this relocation to the clouds, deteriorating much of the effectiveness of traditional protection mechanisms. As a result the aim of this paper is twofold; firstly to evaluate cloud security by identifying unique security requirements and secondly to attempt to present a viable solution that eliminates these potential threats. This paper proposes introducing a Trusted Third Party, tasked with assuring specific security characteristics within a cloud environment. The proposed solution calls upon cryptography, specifically Public Key Infrastructure operating in concert with SSO and LDAP, to ensure the authentication, integrity and confidentiality of involved data and communications. The solution, presents a horizontal level of service, available to all implicated entities, that realizes a security mesh, within which essential trust is maintained. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This evolution could introduce new vulnerabilities to the reliability of electricity supply, based on the introduction and exposure of vulnerabilities in digital systems, architectures, and communications. This situation calls for new security requirements for digital systems and the underlying architecture used in EPUs. Security requirements have to be derived from appropriate risk assessments and general architectural decisions. Numerous existing cyber security standards provide guidance and use-cases which represent valuable inputs for the development of such requirements. The proliferation of standards suggests, however, that the existing documents either do not meet completely the needs of EPUs or are difficult to combine together. This paper focuses on two weak points of the existing cyber security standards in the area. Initially, the paper addresses the characterization, categorization and modeling of malicious cyber threats, which represent key steps in a risk assessment process. The paper presents a conceptual model expressing the meaning and the links between the key concepts of cyber security risks. Following this, the work examines attack modeling, addressing some pertinent technical and architectural issues. In addition, the paper explains why attack modeling is central to risk assessment and present graphical approaches to attack modeling. The second part the paper addresses the use of security architecture principles, notably the graded security approach as a fundamental framework to classify and structure a process of risk mitigation by security controls in both current and future EPU architectures. This discussion starts with the clarification of the terminology related to a graded security approach and then gives a general overview of the characteristics of known standards and best practices of graded security architectures. Following this, the paper presents an outlook of classification criteria to enable the implementation of a graded security approach in a real world environment and then illustrates the effectiveness and adaptability of a graded security approach in a real-world attack case.","Critical infrastructure; CYBER risk assessment; Cyber security; Defense in depth; Graded security approach; Graphical attack modelling; Security architecture; SMART grid applications; Zone model","Computer architecture; Computer crime; Critical infrastructures; Cryptography; Cybersecurity; Electric power system security; Electric power transmission networks; Network architecture; Network security; Smart power grids; Attack modeling; CYBER risk assessment; Cyber security; Defense in depth; Graded security approach; Graphical attack modeling; Grid applications; Risks assessments; Security approach; Security Architecture; SMART grid application; Zone modeling; Risk assessment"

Since, an research has not been done on this ground (the importance of ISMS o supply chain performance). Therefore, it was felt that a research shou have done on these approaches on supply chain. In this respect, curre research was seeking that how ISMS had impact on supply chain performance in automotive industry and this was the innovative aspec of this paper. So first of all, after the review of the information securi management system literature, supply chain performance was considered by the balanced scorecard approach then the most importa factors of these two subjects was extracted by correlation analysis. In this way, it was considered that how ISMS had impact on supply chai performance by correlation analysis. The results showed that differen dimensions of ISMS (information uniformity, prevent the human and machine mistake, information be accuracy, and rectitude and instructi for users) had impact on four dimensions of supply chain performance (customers, financial, internal processes and learning and growth) in three levels (strategic, technical, and operational) in supply chain.

Information security awareness plays an important role in the continuity of an organization. Information security refers to the elements of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, of data or information, in an organization. The research began with definitions of information, information security, and information security awareness, as identified by previous publications. The four independent variables established in this study are policy of information security, education of information security, knowledge of IT, and employee's behaviour towards information security in the workplace. A survey was selected as a research method for the study, and was conducted in order to gain respondent's feedback on the level of information security awareness. The respondents of the study consisted of librarians from private colleges in Shah Alam, Petaling Jaya, and Damansara areas. The survey findings showed that the level of information security awareness was considered high, but the relation or contribution factors proposed by this study were only slight correlated. This was proved in the correlation coefficient analysis in this study, in Chapter 4. From these findings, it can be concluded that further research is needed to clarify the contributing factors of information security awareness in an information provider; such as librarians in a library organization.","Awareness; Information security; Library",""

Well-known and hotly-debated information security risks, due to software vulnerabilities, insider attacks, and side-channels for example, may be only the “tip of the iceberg.” As diverse, independently developed cloud services share ever more fluidly and aggressively multiplexed hardware resource pools, unpredictable interactions between load-balancing and other reactive mechanisms could lead to dynamic instabilities or “meltdowns.” Non-transparent layering structures, where alternative cloud services may appear independent but share deep, hidden resource dependencies, may create unexpected and potentially catastrophic failure correlations, reminiscent of financial industry crashes. Finally, cloud computing exacerbates already-difficult digital preservation challenges, because only the provider of a cloud-based application or service can archive a “live,” functional copy of a cloud artifact and its data for long-term cultural preservation. This paper explores these largely unrecognized risks, making the case that we should study them before our socioeconomic fabric becomes inextricably dependent on a convenient but potentially unstable computing model. © USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Cloud Computing, HotCloud 2012.All right reserved.","","Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Sea ice; Security of data; Web services; Catastrophic failures; Cloud-based applications; Cultural preservation; Digital preservation; Information security risks; Potentially unstable; Software vulnerabilities; Unpredictable interactions; Cloud computing"

Companies and employees try to change this lost time into productive time. Laptops, smart phones and other mobile appliances can be used to do professional work at a distance. But using mobile appliances to access the company network to retrieve information can be risky. Authentication and privacy are two crucial points. Browser attacks and mail client attacks are the biggest threats to mobile applications. Mobile security management can be structured as a 3-steps procedure; first, securing the user mobile devices and the local data; second, securing user communication via interne, or the transition of the data and; third, securing user access to systems on the company server. Mobile learning is one of the possible options on distance professional applications, where learner authentication is a key issue. Also, mobile learning applications require the integration of security design in the development process. The effective professional use of mobile applications can be guaranteed if an information security management policy is formulated and implemented in the organization. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Authentication; E-learning; Industrial management; Mobile computing; Personnel; Professional aspects; Smartphones; Development process; Information security managements; Integration of security; Mobile appliances; Mobile applications; Security management; Transportation facilities; User communication; Information management"

However, if survey findings are to be believed, there are at least signs of practices having improved in more recent times. Despite being exposed to the same policies and related training, employees within an organisation can exhibit very different security behaviours. Professor Steven Furnell and Anish Rajendran of Plymouth University propose a model that more fully identifies the factors influencing security behaviour and compliance. It considers forces that originate within the workplace, alongside various workplace-independent factors that might also affect security behaviour. The role of personality is considered within this model, as is the potential for inconsistencies to arise due to situational factors. Organisations might then use these insights to differentiate security-compliant from non-compliant employees and produce effective mitigation plans. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","","Security of data; Mitigation plans; Plymouth; Situational factors; Technical aspects; Personnel training"

In the end, employees fail to follow the organisation's security polices out of ignorance. The solution to this problem is twofold. First, companies must create security policies and then develop sustainable awareness training campaign to inform and educate staff of the existence of these policies. The security policies will define the tolerable use of organisational data, and will help the organisation in minimizing the threats.

However, they tend to show good performance on off-line data and their accuracy drop when they are deployed to realtime intrusion detection systems that receive data streams constantly. In other words, the problem with a conventional classifier model, when applied to realtime detection systems, is that it is likely to perform poorly against new data that is different from the patterns against which the model was trained. This work presents an adaptive classification framework for a realtime intrusion detection system that changes its behavior according to the patterns occurred in the new received data.

Whilst we have emerged from the threats of late 1990s of viruses such as Code Red and Melissa, through to the phishing emails of the mid 2000's and the financial damage some such as the Nigerian scam caused, we continue to react poorly to new threats such as demanding money via SMS with a promise of death to those who won't pay. So is this lack of awareness translating into problems within the workforce? There is often a lack of knowledge as to what is an appropriate level of awareness for information security controls across an organisation. This paper presents the development of a theoretical framework and model that combines aspects of information security best practice standards as presented in ISO/IEC 27002 with theories of Situation Awareness. The resultant model is an information security awareness capability model (ISACM). A preliminary survey is being used to develop the Awareness Importance element of the model and will leverage the opinions of information security professionals. A subsequent survey is also being developed to measure the Awareness Capability element of the model. This will present scenarios that test Level 1 situation awareness (perception), Level 2 situation awareness (comprehension) and finally Level 3 situation awareness (projection).

The conventional way of operating individual information security systems such as IDS and IPS may not be sufficient to cope with those attacks committed by highly-motivated attackers with significant resources. Therefore, we require the security management services system which provides attack detection, analysis and response on a real-time.

This paper evaluates a high school outreach program designed to increase student learning about information technology (IT), in this case specifically information security. The high school students who participated in the outreach program spent the year using the learning materials provided by Iowa State University, asking their own questions about network security and information assurance, exploring additional resources, and determining how to solve the challenges of setting up a secure and viable network. The capstone event for students who participated in the IT club is a two-day cyber defense competition (CDC) on the Iowa State University campus. During the remote setup, the high school students were able to log into a chat room and ask for guidance or clarification from college students supporting the equipment on campus. These chat conversations were logged and this paper utilizes content analysis to quantitatively analyze the chat conversations in terms of the students progressing through Bloom's taxonomy.

We propose a method for constructing classifiers and profiles of regular users' behavior based on application of Markov chains. We also present the results of experiments conducted within development of a prototype digital library protection system. Finally, examples of a normal profile and an automatically detected anomalous session derived from the real data logs of a digital library illustrate the suggested approach to the problem. © Springer-Verlag London 2012.","","Behavioral research; Markov processes; Security of data; Anomalous behavior; Anomaly detection; Behavior-based; Behavioral model; Data log; Large amounts; Protection systems; Unauthorized copying; Digital libraries"

But this potential can be fully realized only if the data available to researchers is representative of the patient population as a whole. Thus, allowing individual patients to exclude their health information, in keeping with traditional notions of informed consent, may compromise the research enterprise and the medical benefits it produces. This Article analyzes the tension between realizing societal benefits from medical research and granting individual preferences for privacy. It argues for a shift in the conceptual and regulatory frameworks that govern biomedical research. When studies involve electronic record review rather than human experimentation, the traditional, autonomy-dominated model should give way to one that emphasizes the common good. In record-based studies, the limited benefits of individual informed consent come at too high a cost-difficult administrative burdens, significant expenses, and a tendency to create selection biases that distort study outcomes. Other mechanisms can better protect data subjects' privacy and dignitary interests without compromising research opportunities. In this Article, we formulate a novel, multi-faceted approach to achieve these ends. This approach recognizes that technical means for achieving identity concealment and information security are necessary but not sufficient to protect patients' medical privacy and to foster public trust while facilitating research. Hence, we call for supplementing such means with (1) an oversight process that is tailored to record-based research and applies even to de-identified patient records, which are currently exempt from scrutiny, and (2) public notice and education about the nature and potential benefits of such research.","","Electronic Health Records; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; Humans; Informed Consent; Personal Autonomy; Privacy; Research; Science; United States; electronic health record; health insurance; human; informed consent; legislation and jurisprudence; personal autonomy; privacy; research; science; United States"

The reason for this is that the various groups might differ with respect to the risks they are exposed to and the type of security information to be presented. The preference for receiving information might also differ from one user group to the next. In general, the design of an information security awareness programme might differ from one user group to the next. Yet most awareness programmes today focus on the home user in general rather than on specific types of home users. This research focuses specifically on home users segmented according to age due to the limited amount of attention that is paid to the categories. The study is aimed at improving security awareness among home users segmented according to age and culminates in the development of an information security awareness and education framework. The proposed framework attempts to simplify the process of designing an information security awareness and education programme by providing a set of guidelines to the designer that will help him/her to establish who should be receiving what information and the manner in which this information should be received - how the information should be received. It also identifies other design factors that should be considered when creating an information security awareness and education programme. The author believes that the information security awareness and education programme that is designed when using the step-by-step guide presented in this framework is more likely to attract the attention of the specific user that it is designed for. The reason for this is that the programme will be more relevant to each age group. In this way, information security awareness among home users will be enhanced.","Age; Home users; Information security awareness; Information security awareness programmes; Learning styles and preferences","Design; Education; Information management; Sustainable development; Age; Awareness programmes; Design factors; Home users; Information security awareness; Learning Style; Research focus; Security awareness; Security of data"

However, on virtualized x86 systems, covert channel attacks have not yet proven to be practical, and thus the threat is widely considered a “potential risk”. In this paper, we present a novel covert channel attack that is capable of high-bandwidth and reliable data transmission in the cloud. We first study the application of existing cache channel techniques in a virtualized environment, and uncover their major insufficiency and difficulties. We then overcome these obstacles by (1) redesigning a pure timing-based data transmission scheme, and (2) exploiting the memory bus as a high-bandwidth covert channel medium. We further design and implement a robust communication protocol, and demonstrate realistic covert channel attacks on various virtualized x86 systems. Our experiments show that covert channels do pose serious threats to information security in the cloud. Finally, we discuss our insights on covert channel mitigation in virtualized environments.

Patient-centred services are a special kind of health information technology and are designed to cater to patients' needs. They manage personal medical information and utilise such information to offer personalised, advantageous services as well as information for patients. Due to the sensitivity of medical information and the gravity of possible consequences, if medical information falls into the wrong hands, patient-centred services need to employ security measures to ensure the privacy of patients. The German Nationwide Health Information Technology Infrastructure (HTI), which is currently being established, could serve as a fit and proper foundation for securely offering patient-centred services. In this paper, we illustrate the past developments and current status of the HTI introduction with a focus on security aspects related to patient-centred services. We depict how security features of the HTI can be applied to improve secure provision of patient-centred services. Furthermore, we present additional security measures that should be implemented by providers of patient-centred services. © HealthSec 2012 - 3rd USENIX Workshop on Health Security and Privacy.

Moreover, it recorded 6,253 new vulnerabilities, more than in any previous year since report's inception. Threats to cyber systems in the form of Trojans, Worms, Viruses, etc. are increasing at a rate that is overwhelming the ability of security practitioners to keep up. Efforts to address an avalanche of threats is introducing errors and decisions that may be adversely affecting the security of the system the security practitioners are trying to protect. To date, little research has focusedon an important aspect of security effectiveness, the cyber equivalent of ""Friendly Fire"". This paper reviews case studies and available research on Cyber Friendly Fire. The Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines fratricide as ""one who murders or kills his own brother or sister."" Cyber Friendly Fire, the equivalent of cyber fratricide, is defined as ""intentional offensive or defensive cyber/electronic actions intended to protect cyber systems against enemy forces or to attack enemy cyber systems, which unintentionally harms the mission effectiveness of friendly or neutral forces"" (Greitzer et al., 2009). Recent high-profile incidents illustrate how organizations have failed to understand the risks of Cyber friendly fire. Furthermore, the use of multiple cyber security tools may have the perverse effect of damaging system security. The Open Source Vulnerability Database shows at least 1,200 listings where security software has been the cause of a system breaking (Geer Jr, 2010). In these cases, friendly fire has brought down the defenses of the enterprise and exposed the systems to the dangerous threat landscape. The purpose of this reviewis to clarify the factors leading to or causing cyber fratricide, identify gaps in this emerging area of research, and suggest avenues of research that will lead to increased awareness and improved enterprise systems security.","Cyber fratricide; Cyber friendly-fire; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Enterprise systems","Computer viruses; Fires; Open source software; Open systems; Viruses; Cybe fratricide; Cybe friendly-fire; Cyber security; Cyber systems; Cyber threats; Enterprise system; Friendly fire; Security practitioners; Symantec; System security; Cybersecurity"

In the 1990s, researchers realised that technical tools alone cannot solve the problem of IS security incidents and they began to focus their attention on socio-organisational aspects. A ""human factor"" problem has been recognised as the root cause of many security breaches. According to recent research, information security culture needs to be created in organisations in order to promote security-cautious behaviour of employees to avoid such incidents. The concept of information security culture is relatively new and research on this topic is underdeveloped.

It is an indispensable part of the information security system. Due to the variety of network behaviors and the rapid development of attack fashions, it is necessary to develop fast machine-learning-based intrusion detection algorithms with high detection rates and low false-alarm rates. In this correspondence, we propose a novel fuzzy class-association rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems. An incomplete database includes missing data in some tuples; however, the proposed method can extract important rules using these tuples. The GNP-Based Fuzzy Class- Association-Rule Mining performs in existing data only it cannot newly added Intrusion. Therefore we present Intrusion Detection Systems based on analyzing process traces. It also include following steps in GNP-Based Fuzzy Class- Association-Rule Process data model as a mathematical representation of normal behavior Improving the process data model improves the model of normal behavior.

Additionally, some HAZMAT (e.g., petroleum products) are essential to daily functions of our society, and addressing their transport risks also helps to minimize disruptions of their supply chains. In the literature, many have studied quantitative models to develop routing plans minimizing pre-conceived risks. However, little attention is given to identify the risks for HAMAT along its transport chains, let alone to evaluate the effectiveness of existing and potential risk reduction measures. This study develops a risk exposure diagram along the transport chains of HAZMAT, and uses this diagram to devise a questionnaire with three aspects: commodity flow information, security and safety risks in HAZMAT transportation, risk mitigation measures and their effectiveness. Questionnaires are directed at HAZMAT carriers with various sizes. Detailed data analysis will be reported. We also make administrative and managerial recommendations. The results from this study will be used to develop a decision support system that helps HAZMAT carriers to reduce HAZMAT transport risks within their budgets.","Hazardous materials; Risk management; Security; Supply chain management; Transportation","Artificial intelligence; Chains; Decision support systems; Exhibitions; Hazardous materials; Risk management; Supply chain management; Surveys; Transportation; Empirical studies; Hazmat transportation; Minimize disruption; Potential risks; Quantitative models; Risk mitigation; Security; Transport risks; Risk assessment"

Governments have put in place various initiatives and programs including information security awareness to provide the needed understanding on how public sector employees can maintain security and privacy. Nonetheless, the implementation of such initiatives often faces a number of challenges that impede further take-up of e-government services. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the challenges contributing towards the success of information security awareness initiatives implementation in the context of e-government. Political, organizational, social as well as technological challenges have been utilized in a conceptual framework to signify such challenges in e-government projects. An empirical case study conducted in a public sector organization in Greece was exploited in this research to reflect on these challenges. While, the results from this empirical study confirm the role of the identified challenges for the implementation of security awareness programs in e-government, it has been noticed that awareness programmers often pursue different targets of preserving security and privacy, which sometimes results in adding more complexity to the organization.","Awareness; E-government; Implementation challenges; Information security","Information systems; Security of data; Awareness; Conceptual frameworks; e-Government; Empirical case studies; Implementation challenges; Information security awareness; Public sector organization; Technological challenges; Government data processing"

But, as security level is increased, the time and complexity of algorithm is also increased. This is the major cause of decreasing the speed and efficiency of the encryption system. In this paper we have proposed a new encryption algorithm ""Byte - Rotation Encryption Algorithm (BREA)"" with ""Parallel Encryption Model"" which enhances the security as well as speed of the encryption scheme. The BREA is applied on different blocks of plaintext and executes in parallel manner through multithreading concept of single processor system.

Crisis Management Systems (CMS) are a type of Information System that deals with information which needs to be secure. No matter what kind of crisis, natural disasters, man-made crisis or terrorist attacks, the CMS security should not be compromised. There are many challenges regarding exchange of qualified information and interoperability between various Expert Systems and the CMS. It is important to have strong security in terms of technology, skills, security requirements, sensitivity of information and trust-worthiness (Vural, Ciftcibasi and Inan, 2010). Depending on the type of crisis situation, different sets of security components should be triggered, since the security requirements vary between situations. For example, a terrorist attack has different security requirements in the system compared to a natural disaster or a medical emergency. In this paper, the importance of Information Security in CMS will be discussed.

Today in cyberspace, intelligent adversaries exploit vulnerabilities and create incidents that propagate at machine speeds to steal identities, resources, and advantage. The rising volume and virulence of these attacks have the potential to degrade our economic capacity and threaten basic services that underpin our modern way of life. This discussion paper explores the idea of a healthy, resilient - and fundamentally more secure - cyber ecosystem of the future, in which cyber participants, including cyber devices, are able to work together in near-real time to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks, limit the spread of attacks across participating devices, minimize the consequences of attacks, and recover to a trusted state. In this future cyber ecosystem, security capabilities are built into cyber devices in a way that allows preventive and defensive courses of action to be coordinated within and among communities of devices. Power is distributed among participants, and near-real time coordination is enabled by combining the innate and interoperable capabilities of individual devices with trusted information exchanges and shared, configurable policies. To illuminate such a cyber ecosystem in action, one might look at today's practice known as “continuous monitoring,” in which system managers use a variety of software products to automatically detect and report known security vulnerabilities in network nodes. In some cases, system managers further configure their systems to automatically remediate detected security deficiencies. To offer an analogy, continuous monitoring is to a healthy cyber ecosystem as smoke detectors and sprinkler systems are to a “smart” building. At the other end of sophistication in the orderly management of a complex system, we draw inspiration from the human body's immune system. To paint a picture that mirrors the body's ability to defend itself is complex. It might include layered defenses and countermeasures that work in tandem; specialized roles; powerful methods for rapidly identifying attackers; surge capabilities; and the ability to learn and rapidly adapt. A companion analogy may be made to the public health system and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Here, cyber equivalent functions might include threat and incident watch, data dissemination, threat analysis, intervention recommendations, and coordination of preventive actions. Automation is one of three interdependent building blocks of a healthy cyber ecosystem, along with interoperability and authentication. Automation can increase speed of action, optimize decision making, and ease adoption of new security solutions. A healthy cyber ecosystem might employ an automation strategy of fixed, local defenses supported by mobile and global defenses at multiple levels. Such a strategy could enable the cyber ecosystem to sustain itself and supported missions while fighting through attacks. Further, it could enable the ecosystem to continuously strengthen itself against the cyber equivalent of autoimmune disorders. Interoperability can broaden and strengthen collaboration, create new intelligence, hasten and spread learning, and improve situational awareness. This paper posits three types of interoperability - semantic (i.e., shared lexicon based on common understanding), technical, and policy - as fundamental to integrating disparate cyber participants into a comprehensive cyber defense system. It examines how the cybersecurity community has achieved some early successes by explicitly separating the management of security information from the management of security functions in an approach called security content automation. Such successes include: developing naming conventions and shared lists and catalogs of the fundamental elements that we identify here as the ecosystem; creating and using machine readable languages and formats for expressing security policies or encoding security transactions; and developing and using knowledge repositories for best practices, benchmarks, profiles, standards, templates, checklists, tools, guidelines, rules and principles, among others. The paper also looks at some challenges associated with expanding this approach to ensure a widely distributed, automated, collective defense. Authentication can improve trust in ways that enhance privacy and decision making. It is integral to many capabilities beyond cyber defense, and the paper looks to the emerging National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), detailed below, to build a shared foundation. The paper calls for identification and authentication technologies that deliver across five operational objectives: security, affordability, ease of use and administration, scalability, and interoperability. Additionally, the paper calls for consumer guides that rate technologies across all five objectives and assist system developers and owners in making phased improvements and selections. For automated cyber defense, it calls for strong standards-based device authentication, including for software, handheld devices, and small, often wireless, devices composing massively scalable grids. The paper also draws on current research on network-enabled enterprises that is recasting traditional notions of command and control in the direction of focus and convergence. Focus provides the context and defines the purposes of an endeavor, but is agnostic regarding who might be in charge or particular lines of authority. Convergence refers to the goal-seeking process that guides actions and effects, but recognizes that control works in an unconventional manner in highly distributed systems. The paper presents a five-level maturity model for ecosystem focus and convergence that is associated with increasing agility and provides an approach for defining how to achieve and employ these various levels. Ecosystem maturity is further explored through a discussion of healthy attributes-eight for the ecosystem and eighteen for participants and exchanges. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of incentives and recommendations for the way ahead. It posits that the slow adoption of available best practices and technologies in the face of increasing cyber attacks indicates an imbalance of incentives and proposes that better and more widely disseminated aggregated and anonymized information about the frequency and actual harm of cyber attacks is needed. Despite the many open questions remaining, the field is ripe for planning and action. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","Authentication; Automation; Complex networks; Computer crime; Computers; Crime; Decision making; Disease control; Ecology; Ecosystems; Education; Interoperability; Managers; Monitoring; Semantics; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); Authentication technology; Centers for disease control and preventions; Communications technology; Continuous monitoring; Device authentications; Information exchanges; Public health systems; Security vulnerabilities; Network security"

One can use complex network theory to optimize resource locations and optimize actions. Randomly constructed graphs and probabilistic arguments lead to important conclusions with a possible great social and financial influence. Security in online social networks has recently become a major issue for network designers and operators. Being “open” in their nature and offering users the ability to compose and share information, such networks may involuntarily be used as an infection platform by viruses and other kinds of malicious software. This is specifically true for mobile social networks, that allow their users to download millions of applications created by various individual programers, some of which may be malicious or flawed. In order to detect that an application is malicious, monitoring its operation in a real environment for a significant period of time is often required. As the computation and power resources of mobile devices are very limited, a single device can monitor only a limited number of potentially malicious applications locally. In this work, we propose an efficient collaborative monitoring scheme that harnesses the collective resources of many mobile devices, generating a “vaccination”-like effect in the network. We suggest a new local information flooding algorithm called Time-to- Live Probabilistic Propagation (TPP). The algorithm is implemented in any mobile device, periodically monitors one or more applications and reports its conclusions to a small number of other mobile devices, who then propagate this information onward, whereas each message has a predefined “Time-to-Live” (TTL) counter. The algorithm is analyzed, and is shown to outperform the existing state of the art information propagation algorithms, in terms of convergence time as well as network overhead. We then show both analytically and experimentally that implementing the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of infected mobile devices. Finally, we analytically prove that the algorithm is tolerant to the presence of adversarial agents that inject false information into the system. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","",""

In recent years, concerns about governments, terrorists, and criminals using cybertechnologies as weapons have increased. News stories report that government and private sector computer and computer systems are under nearly constant cyberattack from foreign governments, terrorist groups, and transnational organised crime. Under this perspective, cyberspace is awash with cyberweapons wielded with impunity by state and non-state actors. In other contexts, human rights groups have argued that the ubiquitous availability and use of weapons generate human rights violations and there is a need for action to reduce access to and use of weaponry. To date, however, the human rights focus on cyberspace involves advocacy for increasing access to, and effective use of, the Internet as a means for respecting, protecting, and fulfilling human rights. Human rights advocates have behaved differently with respect to cyberweapons than they have regarding development, deployment, and proliferation of many old and new weapons, including a number of ‘less-lethal’ weapons. For the most part, the human rights community has not joined in the hype surrounding perceived threats to national and global cybersecurity, except to remain vigilant that increased cybersecurity should not infringe on the enjoyment of human rights in virtual and non-virtual spaces. © Cambridge University Press 2014.","",""

The wide availability and popularity of the Internet has also led to the rise in risks and threats to users, as criminals have taken an increasingly active role in abusing innocent users. Current risk analysis tools, techniques and methods available do not cater for home users but are tailored for large organisations. The tools require expertise to use them and they are expensive to purchase. What is available for home users are generic information portals that provide a whole-host of awareness raising information, much of which will have varying degrees of usefulness depending upon the particular individual, their technology usage and prior knowledge. As such a tool is required that can bridge the gap between bespoke risk assessment approaches that provide tailored information and broad-spectrum approaches that simply provide all information regardless of its relevance. The paper proposes a web-based risk analysis tool for home users that is simple to use, requires no prior knowledge or expertise of security and can provide bespoke and tailored guidance on improving a users security posture. The tool follows a simple step procedure for gathering key asset and behavioural information to inform the risk profiling process.

A sequential mixed method consisting of a qualitative phase to explore the conceptualisation of information security culture, and a quantitative phase to validate the model is adopted for this research. Eight interviews with information security experts in eight different Saudi organisations were conducted, revealing that security culture can be constituted as reflection of security awareness and security ownership. Additionally, the qualitative interviews have revealed that factors that influence security culture are top management involvement, policy enforcement, and training. These factors were confirmed formed the basis for our initial information security culture model, which was operationalised and tested in different Saudi Arabian organisations. Using data from two hundred and fifty-four valid responses, we demonstrated the validity and reliability of the information security culture model.

The present research closes this gap by studying the information security challenges social media represents for organizations. The research was conducted as a qualitative multiple case study for which information security managers from eleven public and private companies in one European country were interviewed. The study has three main findings. First, challenges arising from employees' actions or unawareness in social media (especially reputation damage) seem to represent bigger threats to information security than threats caused by outside attacks. Second, the confusion of private and professional roles in social media represents an information security risk, and distinguishing between these roles becomes more difficult the higher an employee's position in the company. Third, communication with employees and colleagues represents an information security challenge especially when communication is not steered by the company.

Trustworthiness of the sensor data, especially in the case of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), is an important metric for any application that requires situational awareness. In a WSN, information packets are typically not encrypted and the nodes themselves could be located in the open, leaving them susceptible to tampering and physical degradation. In order to develop a method to assess trustworthiness in WSNs, we have utilized statistical trustworthiness metrics and have implemented an agentbased simulation platform that can perform various trustworthiness measurement experiments for various WSN operating scenarios. Different trust metrics are used against multiple vulnerabilities to detect anomalous behavior and node failure as well as malicious attacks. The simulation platform simulates WSNs with various topologies, routing algorithms, battery and power consumption models, and various types of attacks and defense mechanisms. Additionally, we adopt information entropy based techniques to detect anomalous behavior. Finally, detection techniques are fused to provide various metrics, and various trustworthiness metrics are fused to provide aggregate trustworthiness for the purpose of situational awareness. © 2012 SPIE.","Agent-based simulation; Netlogo simulation; Trust and trustworthiness; Wireless sensor networks","Information fusion; Network architecture; Sensor nodes; Simulation platform; Wireless sensor networks; Agent based simulation; Information assurance; Measurement experiments; NetLogo; Power consumption model; Situational awareness; Trust and trustworthiness; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Network security"

Also, the article evaluates potential risks involved in cargo transportation and therefore provides mobile cargo security assurance service.

Along with these opportunities come challenges, especially to service providers and operations centers that struggle to monitor and manage Quality of Service (QoS) for these services in order to meet customer service commitments. Traditional approaches fall short in addressing these challenges because they examine QoS from a limited perspective rather than from a System of Systems (SoS) perspective applicable to a net-centric enterprise system in which any user from any location can share computing resources at any time. This paper presents a SoS approach to provide QoS monitoring, management, and response for enterprise systems that delivers computing as a service through a cloud computing environment. Concrete examples are provided that identify the key components of this SoS and their application to real-world scenarios.

Information security is important for the management of business risk to enable organizations mitigate vulnerabilities in order to reduce the threat to both reputation and business. Though work has been done for defining techniques to control information security related risks in supply chains, not much work has been done to define a mechanism to assure management of handling these risks across the supply chain. This paper discusses some issues pertaining to information security in supply chains as brought out by various researchers and then proposes a Process Framework for the management of information security. The proposed framework should identify potential risks and possible risk management controls for different areas - Physical security, Human Resource security, Technological security, and evolve performance metrics and an audit process to evaluate the effectiveness of the applied controls. It is expected that the framework will help supply chain managers collaborate with information security and Information Technology specialists to establish, implement and maintain information security across the supply chain. © 2012 CIE & SAIIE.","","Human resource management; Risk management; Security of data; Supply chain management; Business risks; Control information; Management control; Physical security; Potential risks; Process framework; Process networks; Process system; Related risk; Risks management; Supply chains"

Some view this as a noble move which has made the banking system more efficient, reliable and secure, while others view it as a risky and insecure way of banking. The aim of this study was to assess whether eBanking in the developing countries is secure or not. The researcher chose a descriptive-quantitative research design. Data was collected using a self constructed questionnaire. Convenience sampling and stratified random sampling techniques were used to select the main subjects of the study. The responses of management and nonmanagement bank personnel were concentrated on the positive side where they at least agreed that most of the items were implemented. On capital investment, logical access controls, security of network services, behavioural security and human resources competence, management ranked their perceptions significantly higher than those of non-management bank personnel. However, when it came to security policy and the organisational structure of Information Systems department, non-management personnel ranked their perceptions significantly higher than management personnel. Generally on average there was no significant difference between the perceptions of management bank personnel and non-management bank personnel on the security of eBanking. The study recommends further future studies on the security of eBanking in developing countries based on the perceptions of the customers themselves, who are using eBanking services, the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security and also a study of the latent dimensions of eBanking security as extracted by factor analysis, how they differ from elements of information security as derived from the theoretical framework and literature.","Banking system; Ebanking; Ebanking security; Information security; Network services","Behavioral research; Human resource management; Information management; Investments; Network security; Online systems; Banking sectors; Banking systems; E-banking; Ebanking security; Empirical investigation; Networks services; Quantitative research; Research designs; Stratified random sampling; Developing countries"

Fortunately, hundreds of cyber security organizations collaborate to develop security patches and mitigations for most exploits as quickly as they are identified. One method of compromising and controlling victim machines, with little or no risk of being identified or mitigated, is the supply chain attack; specifically, altering the basic input and output system (BIOS) code to reprogram Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips to run covert operating systems and provide undetectable communications for data exfiltration. Not only are the main board's BIOS and circuitry a target for malicious technology insertion, but more powerful graphics cards with independent processing and memory can also provide a safe haven for malicious logic. This paper identifies and demonstrates BIOS and FPGA attacks that can be implemented during the production process, allowing the developer (or attacker) to accomplish persistent covert communications and system control. The authors also discuss the results of a remote BIOS attack and the risks associated with attempting one. Lastly, efforts to identify and mitigate BIOS supply-chain attacks, are outlined to include the implementation of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) standard, which supports hardwarebased BIOS integrity checking, and changes required for production methods and processes that will enhance information assurance for critical assets.","BIOS; Covert communications; Data exfiltration; Field programmable gate arrays; POST; Supply chain attack; Trusted platform module (TPM)","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware security; Logic gates; Trusted computing; Basic input-output systems; Covert communications; Data exfiltration; Field programmable gate array; Field programmables; POST; Production process; Programmable gate array; Supply chain attack; Trusted platform module; Supply chains"

In this paper we present an extended role-based access control model called CMW-RBAC. This new model incorporates the advantages of role-based permission administration together with a fine-grained control of dynamic context attributes.

This paper presents a novel approach for generating dynamically cryptographically S-boxes using a four-dimensional hyperchaotic Lorenz system. Within the algorithm, the initial condition is employed to drive the hyper-chaotic system to generate a chaotic sequence which is used to construct a chaotic key-dependent S-box. With different system initial conditions, many of distinct S-boxes can be obtained dynamically. Some cryptographic properties for a good S-box such as bijection, nonlinearity, SAC (Strict Avalanche Criterion), BIC (Bit Independence Criterion), and differential approximation probability are found to hold in the obtained S-boxes. The analytic results indicated that all the criteria for designing strong S-boxes can be achieved. The comparison of the proposed method for generating S-boxes with other chaos-based schemes indicates that our S-boxes have a better performance with respect to some properties. Finally, the authors give an example of a digital image encryption algorithm using their S-box and the results of image statistical analysis show that the algorithm has the desirable cryptographic properties. © 2011, IGI Global.","Bit Independence Criterion; Chaos; Cryptography; Hyperchaotic Lorenz System; Information Security; Strict Avalanche Criterion; Substitution Box","Algorithms; Chaos theory; Chaotic systems; Security of data; Bijections; Chaotic sequence; Cryptographic systems; Differential approximations; Digital image encryption; Hyper-chaotic systems; Hyperchaotic Lorenz system; Initial conditions; Non-Linearity; S-boxes; Strict avalanche; Substitution boxes; Cryptography"

Although a number of institutional theories deal with information systems (IS) innovation in organizations, most of these institutional-centered frameworks overlook external economic efficiency and internal organizational capability in the presence of pressures of institutional conformity. Using Korea as the institutional setting, our research model posits that economic-based consideration will moderate the institutional conformity pressure on information security adoption while organization capability will influence the institutional confirmation of information security assimilation. The model is empirically tested using two-stage survey data from a field study of 140 organizations in Korea. The results indicate that in addition to institutional influences, our six proposed economic-based and organizational capability moderating variables all have significant influences on the degree of the adoption and assimilation of information security management.

Researchers have noticed serious security flaws and vulnerabilities in most widely used MD and SHA family hash functions. As a result hash functions from FORK family with longer digest value were considered as good alternatives for MD5 and SHA-1, but recent attacks against these hash functions have highlighted their weaknesses. In this paper we propose a dedicated hash function MNF-256 based on the design principle of NewFORK-256. It takes 512 bit message blocks and generates 256 bit hash value. A random sequence is added as an additional input to the compression function of MNF-256. Three branch parallel structure and secure compression function make MNF-256 an efficient, fast and secure hash function. Various simulation results indicate that MNF-256 is immune to common cryptanalytic attacks and faster than NewFORK-256. © 2012 Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University.

Security analysts can be overwhelmed with the amount of data available, whether it is network traffic, audit logs, or IDS alarms. Security monitoring applications need to quickly process this data as they require rapid responses to real-time events. An effective way of dealing withlarge quantities of data is to take advantage of the human visual system and employ data visualization techniques. Data visualization has a long history in scientific computing and medical applications as well as newer areas such as data mining. Techniques for effective data visualization have significantly evolved over the past several years due to increases in processing power, enhanced display devices, massive data storage capability, and faster transmission speeds. One hardware advance that has strongly impacted real-time visualization is the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). GPU's are small special-purpose processing devices thatare packaged hundreds or thousands of units per chip. This allows parallel processing of vast quantities of data to produce high-quality images in real time. As a result of these advances, experts are extending the traditional fields of visualization to a broad range of new applications. For example, many researchers are now experimenting with innovative ways of applying visualization principles to security applications, and many security products incorporate some type of visualization capability. Dedicated books, articles, workshops, and blogsprovide information and forums for interested security professionals to learn about visualization and how to effectively apply it to the security domain. This paper reviews the history and principles of visualization focusing on how it is currently used in the security arena. The paper also discusses current trends in information security visualization research by analyzing and discussing ongoing published visualization projects. These projects focus on techniques such as file visualization, network visualization, log (firewall and intrusion detection) visualization,as well as vulnerability identification and exploits.

In this paper, we seek to ontologically examine information security by using Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's philosophical concepts of machine, coupling, interruption, and territory. Through these concepts, we conceptualize information security as an order-seeking, connection-based, territorial security machine that attempts to subject and harness other actors - from technical devices and physical barriers to employees and various combinations of these actors - to carry out the security machine's protective tasks. The goal of the security machine is to block or interrupt the chaotic forces of the outside and, thus, to maintain the fragile order of information. However, the process of interrupting the outside requires interruption of the inside as well: Users and organizations are interrupted daily by the security machine and its practices. Yet this aspect of information security has remained largely unexamined. We argue that the question of what information security does to its subjects - what its effects are - in the protected system should be examined more thoroughly.","Information Security; Information Security Threat; Socio-Technical Security; Spatiality; Territory","Couplings; Philosophical aspects; Information security threats; Physical barriers; Security machines; Sociotechnical; Spatiality; Territory; Security of data"

It also allows the use of data regardless of their measurement units so according to its characteristics it greatly fits for analysis of city e-governments. With the help of the data envelopment analysis, 41 city administrations were analyzed across 8 selected inputs and 3 outputs. Each city government's e-business was considered with 5 primary aspects, in the respected order: information and communication technologies (ICT), human potentials, information security, information and documentation base and availability of e-services. The obtained results make it possible for managers to compare inefficiently rated city administration units with those of their reference group and improve their effeciency throught the usage of efficiency limit projections. The analysis has shown that city government's e-business has just begun to develop and, depending on the individual city government, is currently situated in the first two phases of development (administration centric and customer aware). From the Croatian e-government development strategy, it's clearly evident that there is hurrying with the harmonization of the legislative for the development of e-government only in those areas which are crucial for the joining with the EU, while the development of e-services is only being mentioned as a mean for satisfying the form. © Jelena Jardas Antonić, Alemka Šegota, 2012.","Data envelopment analysis (DEA); E-government; Local government; Relative efficiency",""

Its objectives are to identify, address, and mitigate risks before they become serious threats. The definition of an ontology, which contains a hierarchical representation and description of security concepts, defined according to the ISO/IEC_JTC1 standards, can assist organizations to classify attacks, identify the critical assets and mitigate their vulnerabilities and threats.

Considering that access to information technology and the Internet is ubiquitous, cyberspace has become a wide area which can be exploited through various criminal activities. As the number of users grows, so do the incidences of cybercrime. Regrettably, users of information technology and the Internet know too little about the dangers in cyberspace and protective measures to maximize security as well as about legislation about cybercrime. In order to accurately gauge the knowledge of the average internet user, we conducted a survey which was posted on the Internet in spring 2011, is the basis for an examination of the perception of cybercrime and an attempt to make sense of the fear of it.The results of the survey are described.The statistical analysis of the questionnaire results show, how users perceive cybercrime. We can see that respondents are relative well informed about cybercrime, but predominantly about incidences exposed in the media. As we know, cyber threats under the media spotlight are not necessarily examples of the greatest threats to users, but they do increase their fear of cybercrime. On the basis of theory and the results of our research, we present the main guidelines that can, if adhered to, minimize security risks in cyberspace. These guidelines can help increase awareness of cyber threats and are a source of information on how to safely interact in cyberspace. Users who are more aware of the risks in cyberspace and know how to deal with them are less afraid of becoming victims of cybercrime. The insights acquired in our research are useful for all cyberspace users and have practical value as they can be used for further study of cybercrime.","Cyber threats; Cybercrime; Internet study; Legal issues; Slovenia","Computer crime; Computers; Cybersecurity; Laws and legislation; Technology transfer; Criminal activities; Cyber threats; Cyber-crimes; Cyberspaces; Internet study; Internet users; Legal issues; Protective measures; Public attitudes; Slovenia; Surveys"

First it summarizes the threat that has been demonstrated in the recent past. Included are a number of data compromises that have been traced to servers in China. Also identified are potential physical attacks against facilities that employ supervisory control networks, with the Stuxnet virus being a recent example. Lastly, the fact that malware has been planted on computers in the electric power grid for later use makes an ability to block the command messages or the remote login sequence an absolute necessity.

However, there has been little research to understand the hackers who are the most important agents determining the landscape of information security. This paper investigates the behaviors of hackers using a longitudinal dataset of defacement attacks. Based on theories of economics of criminal behaviors and variety seeking, we find that hackers seek variety in choosing their victims in terms of region, hacking method, and the type of operating systems; as their prior experience is focused in terms of hacking methods, target regions or operating systems, they tend to launch more attacks using new hacking methods, or against targets in new regions or using new operating systems. Furthermore, hackers are more likely to seek variety as the time interval between the previous and the current attack becomes longer.","Economics of information security; Hacker; Variety seeking; Website defacement","Crime; Information systems; Information use; Network security; Websites; Cyber-attacks; Economics of information; Empirical analysis; Hacker; Prior experience; Target regions; Time interval; Variety seeking; Personal computing"

Furthermore, for completeness the reference architecture defines a gateway capability to bridge any two of the networks connected to the communications terminal. The gateway capability generically specifies translation, filtering (firewalling), bandwidth limiting, and information security and how these aspects are controlled through the GRA control plane, either locally or remotely. The result is a communications node capable of throttling the amount of data going over varying bandwidth backhaul links or tactical radio, all controlled locally or remotely via a single network manager.

More rural communities are becoming integrated into the global village due to increased hardware and software corporate donations, the proliferation of mobile Internet devices and government programs aimed at bridging the digital divide through major broadband expansion projects. These measures facilitate the rapid growth of South African Internet citizens, both through desktop or laptop computers, iPads and mobile phones. Comprehensive research conducted by the authors show that many of the new Internet users are not aptly trained to protect themselves against online threats, leaving them vulnerable to online exploits and inherently exposing the national system to potential international cyber attacks. It is estimated that mobile phone penetration in South Africa is about 98%. In addition, it is suggested that 39% of urban and 27% of rural South Africans are browsing the Internet from their mobile phones Mobile phone penetration statistics are used in correlation with the economic development and exposure to technological advances of South Africans to classify participants in the survey in three groups: urban netizens, semi-rural netizens and rural netizens. South African citizens from areas within the Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces participated in this study. This article works towards the identification of any correlation between the economic development and mobile use propensity of Internet users with regard to National Security. The classification is based on availability of digital amenities, availability of and access to the Internet, the number of users per computer and the level of computer maintenance. Separate from these criteria, the availability of and access to the Internet via mobile phones has also been taken into consideration. The article uses the results from the surveys to identify direct and indirect links between the factors in question. These results are then used to extrapolate the potential threat factor to National Security based on South Africans' cyber security awareness levels.

In recent years, organizations that own and operate these systems have increasingly interconnected them with their enterprise network to take advantage of cost savings and operational benefits. This trend, however, has introduced myriad vulnerabilities associated with the networking environment. As a result, the once isolated systems are now susceptible to a wide range of threats that previously did not exist. To help address the associated risks, security professionals seek to incorporate mitigation solutions designed for traditional networking and information technology (IT) systems. Unfortunately, the operating parameters and security principles associated with traditional IT systems do not readily translate to the SCADA environment; security solutions for IT systems focus primarily on protecting the confidentiality of system and user data. Alternatively, SCADA systems must adhere to strict safety and reliability requirements and rely extensively on system availability. Indeed, mitigation strategies designed for traditional IT systems must be evaluated for the SCADA environment prior to employment to safeguard against adverse operational impacts. This work in progress presents ongoing research that analyzes a traditional host-based intrusion detection system in the SCADA environment. Specifically, we evaluate the Department of Defense (DoD) Host Based Security System (HBSS) employed on a fuels management SCADA system. The preliminary investigation examines whether the increased processing time associated with the HBSS security agent negatively impacts system availability and operations. The research methodology consists of both measurement and simulation evaluations and leverages an operational U.S. Air Force fuels management system and configuration. If findings indicate that the impact to operations is negligible, then the HBSS network defense tool can be employed in the AF fuels management SCADA environment. If successful, HBSS can be extended to other AF and DoD SCADA networks to provide security protections against network-based attacks.","Critical infrastructure protection; Host-based ids; SCADA security","Cybersecurity; Electric power system control; Electric power system security; Electric power transmission networks; Intrusion detection; Network security; Public works; SCADA systems; Security systems; Water treatment; Critical infrastructure protection; Data acquisition environments; Department of Defence; Host based IDS; Host-based; Information technology systems; Security solutions; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Supervisory control and data acquisition security; System availability; Critical infrastructures"

A questionnaire survey of 120 Taiwanese companies was performed to validate the framework. The results show that top management support, information security policy, and institutional policy are positively related to system quality, while top management support, organizational learning culture, and institutional policy are positively related to system service. Additionally, system service is significantly related to organizational benefits. Our model provides two novel aspects of e-learning study. Firstly, we extend IS success model by incorporating four organizational factors as antecedences influencing system quality and system service. Secondly, the model is framed and examined on an organizational level, which provides a top-down view for managers when designing and implementing e-learning systems in the organizational context.","E-learning system; Information security policy; Institutional policy; Organizational benefits; Organizational learning culture; Top management support",""

The study finds that the knowledge or awareness gap between IT professionals and generalist and specialist public administrators is even wider at the local than at the federal (or state) levels.

Human-centricity in this context means that medical staff should be able to configure AC rules, both in a timesaving and reliable manner. Since medical data often includes (meta-) information about a patient, it is essential that an AC system includes the patient into the AC process. To cater for the strong security needs in the medical domain, both the AC policy creation by medical staff as well as the patient-interaction feature need to be taken into account. While traditional AC systems offer sufficient security in theory, they lack in comfort and flexibility and as a result find no widespread acceptance with non tech-savvy users. Distributed medical institutions could enormously benefit from the opportunity of dynamic AC configuration at an end-user level while adhering to legal, ethical or other privacy requirements.

To meet these security standards, some organizations outsource security protection to a managed security service provider (MSSP). However, this may give rise to system interdependency risks. This paper analyzes how such system interdependency risks interact with a mandatory security requirement to affect the equilibrium behaviors of an MSSP and its clients. We show that a mandatory security requirement will increase the MSSP's effort and motivate it to serve more clients. Although more clients can benefit from the MSSP's protection, they are also subjected to greater system interdependency risks. Social welfare will decrease if the mandatory security requirement is high, and imposing verifiability may exacerbate social welfare losses.

To date, cyber operations have been primarily defensive, with the attackers seemingly having the initiative. Over the past three years, several nations (e.g. USA, UK, France, The Netherlands) and NATO have published cyber security strategies emphasising national and international collaboration. Many strategies call for the establishment of a Cyber Security Operations Centre, as well as for a better understanding of attacks. In the scientific literature, Lin (2009) and Denning and Denning (2010) have argued that offensive cyber operations deserve a more open discussion than they have received to date. Research into cyber attacks would improve the scientific understanding of how attackers work, why they choose particular targets, and what tools and technologies they employ. This improved understanding could then be used to implement better defences. Moreover, research would enable governments and other organizations to take offensive action where justified against adversaries, whether these be criminals, terrorists, or enemies. This could include responding to an (impending) attack by counter-attacking or by proactively neutralizing the source of an impending attack. A good starting point to improving understanding would be to model the offensive cyber operations process. The purpose of this paper is to find, formalise, and compare models of the offensive cyber operations process available in the open scientific literature. Seven models were sufficiently well described for formalisation using Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT) notation. Finally, a canonical model has been constructed by rational reconstruction. Although the model has not yet been tested, it has been reviewed by subject matter experts. The paper describes the search methodology, the SADT analysis, the shortcomings of each model, rational reconstruction, and the canonical model. Further work will include elaborating the canonical model to identify the resources needed to set up a Cyber Security Operations Centre with offensive capabilities and to cross-compare the model with the literature on attack ontologies.","Canonical model; Formalisation; Offensive cyber operations; Process model; Rational reconstruction; SADT","Binary alloys; Computer crime; International cooperation; Network security; Terrorism; Uranium alloys; Analysis techniques; Canonical models; Cyber operations; Design technique; Formalisation; Offensive cybe operation; Process-models; Rational Reconstruction; Structured analyse and design technique; Structured analysis; Structured design; Cybersecurity"

These systems collect data from points throughout the operation and communicate control commands to equipment located both locally and remotely. These systems have typically run behind the scenes, but have more recently become front and center as information about real and potential cyberattacks have appeared in the media. Ensuring cybersecurity in the control infrastructure of an energy company may seem like a daunting task as it requires cooperation and commitment from the entire organization as well as support organizations. Upper management must recognize the numerous benefits of a secure ICS. These advantages include ensuring system uptime, reliability, availability, and safety to both the facility and surrounding area. To provide maximum protection for critical ICS data assets, IT teams at energy companies should deploy a ""defense-in-depth"" security approach that includes multiple layers of protection to recognize and thwart cyberattacks. A defense-in-depth approach to network security will provide the most comprehensive protection against malware threats and other forms of cybercrime. Security architectures with multiple layers of protection from multiple vendors provide the best protection, especially when deployed at multiple levels in the network. IT teams at energy companies should continuously review their system's security architecture to identify areas of vulnerability and implement defense-in-depth network strategies where appropriate to ensure that the system's network resources are adequately protected.","",""

Traditional information security practices (e.g., role-based access control) are embedded in enterprise-level systems, but are insufficient to ensure patient privacy. This is due, in part, to the dynamic nature of healthcare, which makes it difficult to predict which care providers need access to what and when. In this paper, we show that modeling operations at a higher level of granularity (e.g., the departmental level) are stable in the context of a relational network, which may enable more effective auditing strategies. We study three months of access logs from a large academic medical center to illustrate that departmental interaction networks exhibit certain invariants, such as the number, strength, and reciprocity of relationships. We further show that the relations extracted from the network can be leveraged to assess the extent to which a patient's care satisfies expected organizational behavior.","","Computer Security; Confidentiality; Health Facility Administration; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Medical Audit; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Models, Organizational; article; computer security; confidentiality; electronic medical record; hospital management; human; medical audit; nonbiological model; public relations"

Many of these activities are carried out over the Internet. These include filling tax returns, online banking, job searching and general socialising. Increased bandwidth and proliferation of mobile phones with access to Internet in South Africa imply increased access to Internet by the South African population. Such massive increased in access to Internet increases vulnerabilities to cyber crime and attacks and threatens the national security. As a result, South Africa remains one of top three countries that are targeted by phishing attacks, the other two are the US and the UK (RSA, 2011). As a response, various entities engage in cyber security awareness initiatieves and trainings with the aim to create cyber security awareness (CSA) among the citizens of South Africa. In the absence of a national cyber security policy, however, these awareness initiatives and programmes are delivered through a variety of independent mechanisms. Various entities engage in cyber security awareness training each with its specific objectives and focus areas. It is argued in this paper that cyber security is complex and multi-faceted. No single solution can effectively address it. While the current means to create cyber security awareness does make impact, the fragmented and uncoordinated nature thereof have a potential to create its own dynamics. The focus of organisations to deliver on their own objectives translates to some extent into the optimisation of the behaviour of individual entities as opposed to the optimisation of the national cyber security awareness as a whole. This paper evaluates the extent to which the current cyber security awareness initiatives address the cyber security threats and risks.

To deal with these insider issues, this study draws on the compliance theory and the general deterrence theory to propose a research model in which the relations among coercive control, which has been advocated by scholars and widely practiced by companies; remunerative control, which is generally missing in both research and practice; and certainty of control are studied. A Web-based field experiment involving real-world employees in their natural settings was used to empirically test the model. While lending further support to the general deterrence theory, our findings highlight that reward enforcement, a remunerative control mechanism in the information systems security context, could be an alternative for organizations where sanctions do not successfully prevent violation. The significant interactions between punishment and reward found in the study further indicate a need for a more comprehensive enforcement system that should include a reward enforcement scheme through which the organizational moral standards and values are established or reemphasized. The findings of this study can potentially be used to guide the design of more effective security enforcement systems that encompass remunerative control mechanisms. © 2013 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

As the e-commerce volume is increasing and various online services are becoming more popular, the number of sites to which an average Internet user subscribes is increasing rapidly. Given the limited memory capacity of human beings, an Internet user's login credentials (in the form of a combination of a user ID and a password) are usually reused over multiple accounts, which can cause significant security problems. In this study, we address the vulnerability of login credentials. First, based on a unique Internet user data set, we analyze the behavioral characteristics of login credentials usage. We find that the same login credentials are used for many more accounts and reused much more often than previously expected. Furthermore, usage patterns are found to be quite skewed. Second, building on a network perspective of login credentials usage, we suggest a vulnerability measure of an individual's login credentials and analyze the vulnerability of current Internet users. The resulting information is valuable not only to the research community but also to managers and policy makers striving to reduce security vulnerability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study examined some of the factors inhibiting the recognition and reporting of losses from cyber-attacks on government departments in South Africa. A survey was conducted in the Western Cape Province. Forty responses were received and analysed using mixed methods. The results indicate that lack of clear guidance on how to calculate losses; lack of understanding of the legislation and knowledge of how it may assist in cubing cyber-crime; lack of training and creation of awareness of cyber-crime and lack of knowledge and capability to assess risks regularly are major factors inhibiting departments from recognising and reporting losses from cyber attacks.","Cybercrime; Human behaviours; Information security; IT; Public sector; South africa","Behavioral research; Computer crime; Crime; Network security; Public administration; Risk assessment; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-crimes; Government departments; Human behaviors; IT; Public sector; Service benefits; Service delivery; South Africa; South African government; Cybersecurity"

The outcome refers to the product or service by which an organization survives or supports itself, such as information security systems in the smart grid. This paper focuses on the variable that could enhance the system processes of an information security system for the smart grid. Questionnaire surveys were carried out, followed by detailed, descriptive analysis. The statistical data portrayed consumer readiness towards the acceptance of smart grid. It also showed the understanding of the consumer towards the criteria identified. Outcomes from the descriptive analysis observed the essential ranking of information security consumer requirements. Results showed that the concern for privacy is the most important element among the other fifteen requirements. The extent to which private data is disclosed consequently determines the way or manner in which the population will perceive this information. Privacy to some degree comes across security, made up of, for instance, the concepts of appropriate use as well as the protection of data and information. The data from VOC showed that philosophy of security determines priorities in enhancing smart grid system processes. The philosophy category has the most powerful impact on consumer trust and satisfaction because the philosophy and strategy of management with regard to information security is the perfect standard against which technology and other security mechanisms can be measured. This statistical data could be referenced by utility providers or policy makers to strengthen information security systems of the smart grid.

The literature shows the importance of appropriate first response in minimising harm and the significant investments being made to educate the public in this regard. It also highlights the privacy concerns that arise from the provision of sensitive health information in electronic form. The method utilised is a Privacy Impact Assessment to ascertain the suitability and compliance of the proposed technology.

Basically, Jokestega methodology takes advantage of recent advances in Automatic Jokes Generation (AJG) techniques to automate the generation of textual steganographic cover. In a corpus of jokes, one may judge a number of documents to be the same joke although letters, locations, and other details are different. Generally, joke and puns could be retold with totally different vocabulary, while still retaining their identities. Therefore, Jokestega pursues the common variations among jokes to conceal data. Furthermore, when someone is joking, anything may be said which legitimises the use of joke-based steganography. This makes employing textual jokes very attractive as steganographic carrier for camouflaging data. It is worth noting that Jokestega follows Nostega paradigm, which implies that joke-cover is noiseless. The validation results demonstrate the effectiveness of Jokestega.

Digital I&C systems can range from experimental systems for reactor control research (at NPRs), to measurement and display systems, to complete reactor console replacements. Because of the increasing difficulty in finding spare parts for their original analog I&C systems, many licensees have begun or have plans to upgrade, refurbish, or replace their old analog I&C systems with digital systems. The perception is that upgrading to a digital I&C system will solve all of a facility's obsolescence problems. However, licensees need to be aware of several issues associated with upgrading to a digital system including obsolescence of the digital system (hardware and software) because of the short product life cycle and the associated cost to acquire, store, and maintain a long-term supply of spare parts. Configuration management and cyber security are also vitally important for any upgrade. Further, it must be recognized that the introduction of software and microprocessors could create new failure mechanisms, such as software errors and increased susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. In fact, experience has shown that these failure mechanisms may cause the reactor to malfunction in a way not previously considered. Thus, a conversion from analog to digital I&C systems solves some problems while potentially introducing others. Recognition of the additional risks coupled with good design, engineering, review, and testing can identify and minimize these risks.","Configuration management; Cyber security; Failure modes; Independence; Obsolescence","Cybersecurity; Display devices; Electromagnetic pulse; Failure (mechanical); Life cycle; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Outages; Configuration management; Cyber security; Digital control; Digital instrumentation; Digital system; Independence; Instrumentation and control system; Power reactor; Reactor control; Spare parts; Obsolescence"

Although some flexibility has been achieved with the introduction of dynamic policies, these efforts have only addressed a fraction of the requirements necessary to secure today's enterprises. Currently, no feedback mechanisms are in place to evaluate the effectiveness or economic impacts of static or dynamic policy implementation. Here, we address the requirement for feedback and present a policy for the next generation. This is a policy that includes a dynamic feedback response to the effectiveness of changes. The structure of this new type of policy, called a 'management system', is borrowed from discrete event system theory and functions as a control loop. A management system consists of four elements (control system, sensor, controller, and actuator) that are involved in a control law. In this article, we present also an analytical description of the optimal structure through which the three management systems (Information Security Management System (ISMS), Business Continuity Management System, and IT Service Management) should be linked in a company. We define a coupling parameter and, using an equation for the discrete control loop, show that ISMS and IT Service Management should ideally be strongly coupled, and ISMS and Business Continuity Management System should be weakly coupled. Furthermore, two types of management system can be defined. A simple management system (1 st order management system) responds to and regulates only perturbations. An advanced management system (2 nd order management system) has an overarching target function that influences the controller. This target function is usually economically oriented.

Their objectives are not to disrupt, but rather create an effect or illusion meeting their specific mission or agenda. This paper will demonstrate how anyone can accomplish a DoS attack against a targeted wireless user using free open source tools and why this is preferable to standard DoS methods. Specifically, the authors will demonstrate how using one particular tool can deny service either on one or many wireless users to create a variety of effects. This paper will describe various reasons as to why someone may want to take this approach and its benefits as well as the limitations of the tool. Technical examples of distance, obstructions, attenuation, antenna power, etc., will support the authors' assertions and theories.

Watermarking is a useful technique for multimedia copyright protection. In this paper, we develop a robust video watermarking system. It consists of two components, that is, watermarking embedder and watermarking detector. In the embedder, we insert a watermark pattern into video frames according to a watermark payload. The watermark pattern is generated from a pseudo-random noise sequence generator using the spread spectrum technique. User and copyright information are mapped to a binary sequence and then encrypted with advanced encryption standard and encoded/protected by convolutional error correction code to produce a watermark payload. The watermark pattern is weighted and embedded to each frame to meet perceptual requirements. In addition, the video is slightly geometrically manipulated in order to defend possible collusion attacks. The detector extracts the watermark from the candidate video.

Although, technical and procedural security measures help improve information security, there is an increased need to accommodate human, social and organizational factors. While employees are considered the weakest link in information security domain, they also are assets that organizations need to leverage effectively. Employees' compliance with Information Security Policies (ISPs) is critical to the success of an information security program. The purpose of this research is to develop a measurement tool that provides better measures for predicting and explaining employees' compliance with ISPs by examining the role of information security awareness in enhancing employees' compliance with ISPs. The study is the first to address compliance intention from a users' perspective.

In four studies, we examine user perceptions of wireless Internet service quality, with an aim to understand consumers' irrational choice of a dominated product over a dominant option. Our results indicate that consumers make inference in security from convenience using a zero-sum heuristic and that they believe in improving security in return for losing convenience. In a choice setting, we empirically show that security perception, as well as convenience, influences consumers' product choices, contradicting the common view of existing literature that convenience is the sole driver of consumer choice.

Web security has been a serious issue of information security, and SQL-injection is one of the most common means of attack against Web services. SQL Injection often changes the structure of SQL statements. This paper proposed a self-learning approach to counter SQL Injection which can learn automatically the structure feature of all legal SQL statements to construct knowledge library based on SQL syntax tree in safe environments, and then match every SQL statement with knowledge library to find whether the structural feature has been changed in real environments. If successful, this SQL statement is legal. SQL statements which fail pattern marching are not determined as illegal immediately. Then, we take depth-feature check based on Value-at-Risk, and identity the true illegal SQL statements. This method which combines mode-matching and characterfiltering can reach good results.

SDR and CR may introduce entirely new classes of security threats and challenges including download of malicious software, licensed user emulation and selfish misbehaviors. An attacker could disrupt the basic functions of a CR network, cause harmful interference to licensed users or deny communication to other CR nodes.

To do so, we developed a factorial survey to determine the effects of user interface design features relating to three aspects of accountability: (1) identifiability, (2) evaluation, and (3) social presence.

FP employs a typical method of sequential mining based on frequency analysis, and uses a short sequence model to find out quickly frequent sequential patterns in the training system-call sequences. TP makes use of the technique of tree pattern mining, and can get a quality profile from the training system-call sequences of a given system. Experimental results show that FP has good performances in training and detecting intrusions from short system-call sequences, and TP can achieve a high detection precision in handling long sequences. © 2012, Copyright the authors.","Data mining; Frequency pattern; Intrusion detection; Tree pattern","Data Processing; Detection; Forestry; Computer operating systems; Data mining; Forestry; Mercury (metal); Pattern recognition; Security of data; Trees (mathematics); Data mining technology; Detection precision; Frequency Analysis; Frequency patterns; Frequent sequential patterns; Intrusion detection models; System-call sequence; Tree pattern; Intrusion detection"

This CLC protocol needs not store the security-sensitive table on the server side, which reduces the danger of the server being compromised; also, it has the advantage in terms of the round efficiency and computational cost. However, we find that the leakage of values VA and VB in the CLC protocol will make a man-in-the-middle attack feasible in practice. On the basis of this finding, we present a modified 3PAKE protocol called I-CLC protocol, which is essentially an improved CLC protocol. I-CLC can resist attacks available, including the man-in-the-middle attack that we mentioned on the initial CLC protocol. Meanwhile, the new protocol allows that the participants choose their own passwords by themselves; additionally, the computation cost of I-CLC is lower than that of CLC protocol. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Authentication; Information security; Key agreement; Man-in-the-middle attack","Computational efficiency; Network security; Security of data; Authenticated key exchange; Authenticated key exchange protocols; Computation costs; Computational costs; Key agreement; Man in the middle attacks; Security analysis; Server sides; Authentication"

It is important to provide security mechanisms to P2P systems, since it has already become one of the key issues when evaluating them. However, even though many P2P systems have been adapted to provide a security baseline to their underlying applications, more advanced capabilities are becoming necessary. Specifically, privacy preservation and anonymity are deemed essential to make the information society sustainable. Unfortunately, sometimes, it may be difficult to attain anonymity unless it is included into the system's initial design. The JXTA open protocols specification is a good example of this kind of scenario. This work studies how to provide anonymity to JXTA's architecture in a feasible manner and proposes an extension which allows deployed services to process two-way messaging without disclosing the endpoints' identities to third parties.

Based on the model, a linguistic term oriented multi criteria group decision-making method is developed. The method uses general fuzzy number to deal with the three uncertain factors described by linguistic terms and aggregates these factors into a group satisfactory decision that is in a most acceptable degree of the group. Moreover, this study implements the method by developing a webbased group decision support system. This system allows decision makers to participate a group decision-making through the web, and manages the group decision-making process as a whole, from criteria generation, alternative evaluation, opinions interaction to decision aggregation.

Organizations use risk assessment to determine the risks within an information system and provide sufficient means to reduce these risks. In this paper, a hybrid procedure for evaluating risk levels of information security under various security controls is proposed. First, this procedure applies the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach to construct interrelations among security control areas. Secondly, likelihood ratings are obtained through the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method; as a result, the proposed procedure can detect the interdependences and feedback between security control families and function in real world situations. Lastly, the Fuzzy Linguistic Quantifiers-guided Maximum Entropy Order-Weighted averaging (FLQ-MEOWA) operator is used to aggregate impact values assessed by experts, applied to diminish the influence of extreme evaluations such as personal views and drastic perspectives. A real world application in a branch office of the health insurance institute in Taiwan was examined to verify the proposed procedure. By analyzing the acquired data, we confirm the proposed procedure certainly detects the influential factors among security control areas. This procedure also evaluates risk levels more accurately by coping with the interdependencies among security control families and determines the information systems safeguards required for better security, therefore enabling organizations to accomplish their missions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A crypto resistance security analysis illustrates that the nonlinear exit from the proposed scheme is stable against known cryptographic attacks. A NIST statistical test applied to the new cryptographic approach shows perfect random-like behavior of output bit sequences. We applied the proposed algorithm to encrypt color images (24 bits/pixels) and estimated results by histogram analysis, correlation coefficients of adjacent pixels, key sensitive test, and information entropy analysis. The encrypted images were also tested by the statistical differential attack, estimating the two criteria: number of pixels change rate and unified average changing intensity. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method is efficient and provides a high level of security.

However, in the large-scale enterprise application environments, the traditional RBAC model based on the role hierarchy has the following deficiencies: Firstly, it is unable to reflect the role relationships in complicated cases effectively, which does not accord with practical applications. Secondly, the senior role unconditionally inherits all permissions of the junior role, thus if a user is under the supervisor role, he may accumulate all permissions, and this easily causes the abuse of permission and violates the least privilege principle, which is one of the main security principles. To deal with these problems, we, after analyzing permission types and role relationships, proposed the concept of atom role and built an atom-role-based access control model, called ATRBAC, by dividing the permission set of each regular role based on inheritance path relationships. Through the application-specific analysis, this model can well meet the access control requirements. © 2012 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Access control; Atom role; ATRBAC; RBAC","Atoms; Security of data; Access control models; Application specific; ATRBAC; Control requirements; Enterprise applications; RBAC; Role-based access control model; Security principles; Access control"

The continuous evolution of external and internal threats and the associated need to protect and secure information from exploitation of vulnerabilities has become a struggle for many organizations in both the public and private sectors. This struggle is the direct result of the narrow focus on operational security. Just as the lines between business and information technology have disappeared, so have the lines between business and information security. Some organizations simply ""check the box"" by performing the minimum actions required to pass or meet mandated compliance standards. Without practicing due diligence and by only meeting the minimum requirements, leads to the reactive response of exploited vulnerabilities in addition to the increase of after the fact incident investigations.

It is known that when determinant of matrix is zero, the matrix is noninvertible or singular matrix. This paper presents special properties for forming singular matrix. When square matrix is formed using those properties, the resultant matrix is degenerate i.e singular matrix. Determinant of the matrix thus formed is zero except matrix of order 1 X 1 and 2 X 2 and the matrix satisfies the most of the properties of the determinant. In this paper, we have shown how matrix of order n X n can be constructed by using special properties. We subject the new matrix thus formed to various arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction and multiplication), the resultant matrices are all singular. The results of these operations show that all resultant matrices produced as result of these operations except the multiplication satisfies the special properties. Any matrix that obeys the special properties is singular and the determinant value is equal to the difference between the sums of main diagonal and off diagonal elements.

Previous studies approach policy enforcement using deterrence theory to deal with information security violations and focus on end-users' awareness. This study investigates deterrence strategy within organisations from the perspective of information security managers. The results primarily reveal that current deterrence strategy has little influence on reducing violations because it is only used as a prevention strategy due to the lack of means of detection. Our study suggests that organisations should shift to detection of violations and identification of violators, and expand the range of sanctions. The research also presents an architecture of information security strategies to be operated in a coordinated manner for use in deterring security violations.","Architecture of deterrence strategy; Deterrence strategy; Information security; Information security strategy","Information technology; Management; Managers; Security systems; Societies and institutions; Deterrence strategy; End-users; Information security policies; Information security strategy; Policy enforcement; Security violations; Security of data"

Based on a search log from a large search engine, spanning three months, this study explores user patterns of query submission and subsequent clicks in sessions, for two important risk related topics, healthcare and information security, and compares them to other randomly sampled sessions. We investigate two session-level metrics reflecting users' interactivity with a search engine: session length and query click rate. Drawing from information foraging theory, we find that session length can be characterized well by the Inverse Gaussian distribution. Among three types of sessions on different topics (healthcare, information security, and other randomly sampled sessions), we find that healthcare sessions have the most queries and the highest query click rate, and information security sessions have the lowest query click rate. In addition, sessions initiated by the users with greater search engine activity level tend to have more queries and higher query click rates. Among three types of sessions, search engine activity level shows the strongest effect on query click rate for information security sessions and weakest for healthcare sessions. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the study. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Information security is identified as one of the requirements for the successful e-Government implementation although the government has not adopted any standards or issued guidelines to government agencies with regards to information security. Comprehensive addressing of information security can be an expensive undertaking and without guidelines information security implementations may be more prone to failure. In a resource poor country such as Tanzania, there is a need for a cost effective and sustainable means of addressing information security in e-Government implementations. In this paper the authors present a case study of an e-Government interaction between a ministry and a government agency and the information security challenges identified in the implementation. In order to address these challenges an information security framework is conceptualized using action research. The framework is applied in the case study to address the identified challenges and the means to address future challenges in a sustainable manner is identified. Finally, the proposed framework is evaluated against Tanzanian and international metrics. © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.","e-Governance; e-Government; e-Government in Tanzania; information security; information security framework",""

This research was motivated by previous case studies that suggested that the practice of incident response frequently did not result in the improvement of strategic security processes such as policy development and risk assessment. An exploratory in-depth case study was performed at a large global financial institution to examine shortcomings in the practice of incident response. The case study revealed the practice of incident response, in accordance with detailed best-practice guidelines, tended to adopt a narrow technical focus aimed at maintaining business continuity whilst neglecting strategic security concerns. The case study also revealed that the (limited) post-incident review process focused on 'high-impact' incidents rather than 'high-learning' (i.e. potentially useful incidents from a learning perspective) incidents and 'near misses'. In response to this case study, we propose a new double-loop model for incident learning to address potential systemic corrective action in such areas as the risk assessment and policy development processes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate the consequence of the mechanism through experiments where the ISO/IEC standard block cipher AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is implemented on an FPGA board and EM radiations from power and communication cables are measured. Correlation Electromagnetic Analysis (CEMA) is conducted in order to evaluate the information leakage. The experimental results show that secret keys are revealed even though there are various disturbing factors such as voltage regulators and AC/DC converters between the target module and the measurement points.

Much research therefore concentrates on the way in which information security policies contribute to the protection of systems from internal and external threats.

Against this backdrop, this paper seeks to provide novel insights into the role and purpose of information security policies by reviewing them through a critical theoretical lens. It presents the results of a critical discourse analysis which looked for evidence of ideology and hegemony within a sample of information security policies from the UK's National Health Service.

The SUP architecture comprises static and dynamic dimensions; the static dimension, or disciplines, includes business modeling, assets, security policy, implementation, configuration and change management, and project management. The dynamic dimension, or phases, contains inception, analysis and design, construction, and monitoring. Risk assessment is a major part of the ISMS process. In SUP, we present a risk assessment model, which uses a fuzzy expert system to assess risks in organization. Since, the classification of assets is an important aspect of risk management and ensures that effective protection occurs, a Security Cube is proposed to identify organization assets as an asset classification model.

For now central IT management probably still controls the lion's share of BCM because of the dependency on centrally managed IT and communications. But the ubiquitous growth of cloud services and the pressure to control and reduce information management and processing costs can lead managers who have sufficient authority and budget to adopt cloud-based services that may be inconsistent with the organization's overall business continuity strategy and tactics.One of the most significant elements of information and IT reliability and continuity is information security management (ISM). Threats to information security can easily create risks with a higher potential cost than the organization can absorb. As cloud based services are adopted, it is crucial that BCM and ISM exercise ongoing controls over all changes to infrastructure, architecture, processes, and services that involve sensitive information and/or business-critical functions. Cloud service buyers must beware of promises that processes will be simplified and costs will be decreased. While such goals may be attainable, it is the buyer's responsibility to ensure new service models do not introduce unacceptable security risks or hidden costs that can have an opposite effect from what was intended and promised.

Estimating feasible attack impact requires an evaluation of the grid's dependency on its cyber infrastructure and its ability to tolerate potential failures. A further exploration of the cyber-physical relationships within the smart grid and a specific review of possible attack vectors is necessary to determine the adequacy of cybersecurity efforts. This paper highlights the significance of cyber infrastructure security in conjunction with power application security to prevent, mitigate, and tolerate cyber attacks. A layered approach is introduced to evaluating risk based on the security of both the physical power applications and the supporting cyber infrastructure. A classification is presented to highlight dependencies between the cyber-physical controls required to support the smart grid and the communication and computations that must be protected from cyber attack. The paper then presents current research efforts aimed at enhancing the smart grid's application and infrastructure security.

Using a pseudo-random sequence, the random subset is selected from a set of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) shared private-key for encryption. Quantum information is rotated and hidden by disguising it as noise in a quantum error-correcting code. A subset of detection is constructed and based on the complement of shared private-keys. Based on the detection scheme of typical error, the private-key can be recycled. Compared to other protocols which require more private keys, the proposed scheme can significantly reduce key consumption. The ability of eavesdrop detection is optimized. The optimized scheme is robust to the Trojan horse attacking.","Covert communication; Entanglement private-key; Information security; Quantum cryptography","Communication; Error detection; Optimization; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Security of data; Covert communications; Detection scheme; Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger; Private-key; Pseudorandom sequences; Quantum error correcting codes; Quantum Information; Random subsets; Trojan horse; Quantum entanglement"

The study uses the quantitative research method to analyze the responses to open-ended questions by 56 ICT librarians in private colleges. An empirical study is presented of an information security culture assessment instrument, which is a questionnaire, thereby providing a valid and reliable tool that can be used by organizations (libraries) to assess the in-house level of the information security culture. The evidence suggests that principles significantly influence the information security culture among ICT librarians. The developed statements in the information security culture assessment instrument are not categorized to be answered by different audiences in an organization. This could be useful as not all employees would, for instance, be in a position to answer management and strategic questions. Practitioners should understand the factors influencing the information security culture in order to develop a good culture and at the same time to protect their information assets in organization. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

The theoretical, technological and applications aspects of IPE require a framework that provides a general view and a systematic structure for the discipline's topics. This study discusses certain characteristics of such a framework and proposes enhancing and strengthening its structure. Approach: Several important problems and their solutions are presented through recasting of some current proposed approaches to Personal Identifiable Information (PII) definitions and handling. Results: A new framework is presented that is based on flow-based model, along with generic operations performed on PII. Conclusion: This study shows that the flow-based model can provide a structure that complements current efforts to develop a framework for IPE. © 2012 Science Publications.","Applications aspects; Conceptual model; Information privacy; Information privacy engineering (IPE); Information security; Personal identifiable information (PII); Privacy-enhancing technologies",""

The service is based upon implementation of a recent formal definition and mathematical result (James et al. 2009) derived from the decades-old Bell-LaPadula information security result (Bell and LaPadula, 1973). The service provides decision makers a means of securely and automatically sharing critical information across security barriers based upon declaration of sharing policies. The declaration and implementation of information sharing policies based upon a need-to-share has been shown to be compatible with information protection policies based upon a need-to- know. Indeed, the implementation of the need-to- share service is based upon extending the mathematical foundations of need-to-know information security systems (the Bell-LaPadula result of 1973). © 2012 IEEE.","","Bells; Decision making; Decision support systems; Network security; Real time control; Security of data; Decision makers; Decision supports; Formal definition; Information protection; Information sharing; Mathematical foundations; Real-time data; Security barriers; Information dissemination"
