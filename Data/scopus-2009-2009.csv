Applying the reductionism concept of the positivist paradigm for information security means missing the bigger picture and thus, the lack of holism which could be one of the reasons why security is still overlooked, comes as an afterthought or perceived from a purely technical dimension. We need to reshape our thinking and attitudes towards security especially in a complex and dynamic environment such as e- Business to develop a holistic understanding of e-Business security in relation to its context as well as considering all the stakeholders in the problem area. In this paper we argue the suitability and need for more inductive interpretive approach and qualitative research method to investigate e-Business security. Our discussion is based on a holistic framework of enquiry, nature of the research problem, the underling theoretical lens and the complexity of e-Business environment. At the end we present a research strategy for developing a holistic framework for understanding of e-Business security problems in the context of developing countries based on an interdisciplinary inquiry which considers their needs and requirements. © 2009 WASET.ORG.","Complexity; E-Business Security; Interpretive qualitative research and Case study method; Methodological considerations","Developing countries; Research; Security of data; Complexity; Dynamic environments; E business environment; E-Business Security; eBusiness; Information security; Information systems security; Interpretive qualitative research and Case study method; Methodological considerations; Problem areas; Qualitative research methods; Research problems; Research strategy; Electronic commerce"

It discusses the cyberterrorism parameters-the cyberterrorists, the attacks, and the countermeasures-as well as the Internet's physical security. The paper sounds an alarm over the current accessibility of critical intranets via the Internet, and points out that the risks in this practice outweigh any possible benefits. Concern is also raised over the security of Internet's physical infrastructure, suggesting increased redundancy and that countries have more physical entry points into cyberspace. The paper concludes with two recommendations. One is the physical isolation of the Internet from critical intranets, and the other is the development of an Internet SCADA to oversee the Internet's performance in the U.S. cyberspace.

With high-resolution digital images as carriers, detecting hidden messages is also becoming considerably more difficult. In this paper, we describe a universal approach to steganalyse the least significant bit steganography method for detecting the presence of hidden messages embedded within digital images. The proposed work uses the 27 features that are calculated from the three different statistical moments i.e., PDF, CF and Absolute moment calculated from wavelet multi-resolution representation of the images. We have presented the efficacy of our approach on a large collection of images, and on four different LSB steganographic embedding algorithms. Four soft computing techniques viz., Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and K-nearest neighbor classifier are employed to efficiently distinguish the pure image from the anomalous or stego image file. The proposed steganalysis algorithm can steadily achieve a correct classification rate of over 90% thus indicating significant achievement in steganalysis.","Information security; LSB steganalysis; Soft computing techniques; Statistical moments","Classifiers; Decision trees; Digital image storage; Nearest neighbor search; Security of data; Soft computing; Support vector machines; Decision tree classifiers; High resolution digital images; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Least significant bit steganography; LSB steganalysis; Multi resolution representation; Softcomputing techniques; Statistical moments; Steganography"

Potential problems concerning people management are developed by using Geert Hofstede's and Edward Hall's cultural frameworks. Analyzed are the problems concerning people management. To evaluate the magnitude of potential of problems, a new measure namely Level of Potential (LoP) is adopted. A survey was conducted in Malaysia to evaluate the severity of potential problems and the practicability of LoP. To examine the usability of developed LoPs (logical LoPs), the association level between the logical LoPs and their surveyed LoPs is compared. As a result, LoP can predict problems to a certain extent. The problem ""Unintentional sharing of confidential information."" is a problem with the highest severity among the potential problems as ""teaching others"" is encouraged by employees' beliefs.","Cultural Differences; Cultural Dimensions; Information Security Management; People Management","Mobile security; Surveys; Confidential information; Cultural difference; Cultural dimensions; Cultural environment; Foreign companies; Information security managements; People management; Potential problems; Security of data"

This paper presents the development of a comprehensive model that highlights the security impacts of cloud computing on organisations' information security strategies. The 'cloud-free' security model symbolises a computing model with a low level of uncertainty regarding security concerns. Using theoretical frameworks and deploying the analytic hierarchy process as a quantitative method technique, the model will be both validated and assessed. The model can be applied in assessing the security issues emanating from cloud computing, identifying the security countermeasures needed to address these issues and coordinating the efforts of the various participants to enhance information security in organisations adopting cloud computing.

The aim of the study has been to shed light on a handful organizational security measures that contribute to the detection and reporting of security incidents. The results confirm significant positive correlations between organizational security measures and reporting of IT abuse incidents. But personal beliefs and judgements of the observed security breaches, however, influence the willingness to report colleagues to security management. Moreover, the results show that the reporting regime in Norwegian enterprises is too loose and the punishment too low to confirm any strong deterrent effect on employees, and most IT abuse incidents are regarded to be insignificant and not considered as criminal incidents.","Computer crime; Incident reporting; Information security","Computer crime; Crime; Mobile security; Effect on employees; Incident reporting; Positive correlations; Qualitative data; Security breaches; Security incident; Security management; Security measure; Security of data"

At present customers can do banking online which is easy and time saving and at the same time they are vulnerable to threats. This paper seeks to investigate the current debate regarding the threats and vulnerabilities of the information security of online banking and to study some possible remedial actions to defend the threats. The aim of this research is to flesh out and critically analyse data and findings from the research dedicated to the online banking and its information security problems. This would lead to 1) outlining the overview of online banking and its information security system, 2) investigating the specific threats of online banking regarding information security, 3) justifying the role of information security threats in financial losses and the acceptance of online banking by the customers, 4) searching for the critical success factors, and 5) forecasting some possible solutions in the near future. The research finds out the threats of information security of online banking with some real successful fraudulent activities happened in the past and proposes different security measures that can be taken to protect the internet frauds. These measures will help customers to develop awareness by education and training, and improve online services provided by the banks which could develop a safeguard against the frauds by the policy reengineering and using advanced unique technology.

These attacks exploit the dependence of the leakage current of CMOS Integrated Circuits (ICs) on their inputs (e.g., the secret key of a cryptographic circuit). For this reason, these novel attacks are referred to as Leakage Power Analysis (LPA) attacks in this paper. Since the leakage power increases much faster than the dynamic power at each new technology node, LPA attacks are shown to be a serious threat to information security of cryptographic circuits in sub-100 nm technologies. For the first time in the literature, a well-defined procedure to perform LPA attacks is presented.

They can have highly irregular access patterns with very little locality that do not match the expectations of automatically controlled caches. In other cases, such as when they process data in streaming, they do not have temporal locality at all and only limited spatial locality, therefore reducing the effectiveness of caches. We present an application-driven study of several architectures that are suitable for data-intensive algorithms. Our chosen application is high-speed string matching, which exhibits two key properties of data-intensive codes: highly irregular access patterns and high-speed streaming data. Irregular access patterns appear in string matching when traversing graph-based representations of the pattern dictionaries being used. String matching is typically used in cybersecurity applications to scan incoming network traffic or files for the presence of signatures (such as specific sequences of symbols), which may relate to attack patterns, viruses, or other malware. String Matching String matching algorithms check and detect the presence of one or more known symbol sequences inside the analyzed data sets. Besides their wellknown application to databases and text processing, they are the basis of several other critical, real-world applications. String matching algorithms are key components of DNA and protein sequencing, data mining, security systems, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for Networks (NIDS), Applications (APIDS), Protocols (PIDS), or Systems (Host based IDS [HIDS]), anti-virus software, and machine learning problems. © Cambridge University Press 2013.","","Application programs; Bioinformatics; Computer crime; Computer viruses; Gene encoding; Intrusion detection; Machine components; Malware; Network architecture; Network protocols; Text processing; Antivirus softwares; Data-intensive application; Data-intensive computing; Graph-based representations; Hardware architecture; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning problem; Specific sequences; Network security"

Importantly, this growth is being matched by the number of people gaining access to the Internet in a variety of ways. E-commerce offers opportunities as well as threats. Information is crucial for any organization especially in the emarket. A key negative perception centres on the security involved in internet practice and electronics payments systems. The lack of an effective and trusted payment system that can be used in combination with on-line shopping has been limiting factor in the growth of internet sales. Consumers are hesitant to provide personal information, including credit card details, over the internet because of high perception of risk and concerns with privacy. Negative perceptions are then compounded and reinforced by massive media exposure of Internet security incidents. From a lack of positive experiences and negative perceptions, many consumers still lack the necessary trust in on-line merchants and Internet security procedures and continue to use the web to simply surf. Establishment of Information Security System can minimize the threats and risks. The paper provides an overview of electronic commerce and the impact of risk on on-line shopping environment. Due to the growth and potential of on-line shopping and the lack of academic based research on internet-related consumer behaviour, there is a tremendous need for independent, academic investigation into the behaviour and perceptions of on-line consumers. The present study collected data on the perceptions of risk in relation to information security from a sample size of 624, which include both online and traditional shoppers. The data were then analyzed in order to investigate the current trends of consumer behaviour when making transactions in e-commerce environment.

A next generation of airplane designs, incorporating wired and wireless network interfaces, will support a wide spectrum of ""eEnabled"" or network-enabled applications, including distribution of airplane software, collection and off-board retrieval of airplane health reports, perhaps even participation in advanced collaborative air traffic control. In this context it is clear that airline business viability and even flight safety will come to depend on the security of data transported in these applications. Trust is a fundamental element of security and information assurance in any business context, and must be treated as such in the design of networked IT systems. We consider the establishment and maintenance of trust relations for an application typical of network- enabled airplane applications, namely an Airplane Assets Distribution System (AADS) which affords a capability for on-line distribution of airplane-resident software from suppliers via airlines to airplanes. The AADS involves a large number of parties, among whom explicit and manageable trust relations are essential. In order to achieve integrity and authenticity of software transmitted via the AADS, an infrastructure design solution employing digital signatures and public-key infrastructure must be instantiated and adapted for use in the aviation environment, which has its own architectural peculiarities and stringent assurance requirements. We introduce a protocol for initializing the certificate of an airplane which is used to secure and authenticate data sent by the airplane to its owning airline. We describe the basic protocol and several protection variants, first in an informal discussion and then in a precise formal way, pointing out the differences in security properties of the variants. Finally, we report on the results of model-checking our formalizations using the AVISPA protocol validation tool. The Airplane Certificate Initialization Protocol serves as a concrete example our methodology for modeling, analyzing, and discussing the design of safety- and security- critical IT systems currently under development in the aerospace industry. Our experience shows this methodology is effective for exploring requirements and design alternatives, surfacing important issues, and giving evidence that the system architecture meets the desired security goals.

The 20/20 hindsight of audits is no longer an effective solution to security weaknesses, and the necessity for real-time strategic metrics has never been more critical. Information Security Management Metrics: A Definitive Guide to Effective Security Monitoring and Measurement offers a radical new approach for developing and implementing security metrics essential for supporting business activities and managing information risk. This work provides anyone with security and risk management responsibilities insight into these critical security questions: How secure is my organization? How much security is enough? What are the most cost-effective security solutions? How secure is my organization? You can’t manage what you can’t measure This volume shows readers how to develop metrics that can be used across an organization to assure its information systems are functioning, secure, and supportive of the organization’s business objectives. It provides a comprehensive overview of security metrics, discusses the current state of metrics in use today, and looks at promising new developments. Later chapters explore ways to develop effective strategic and management metrics for information security governance, risk management, program implementation and management, and incident management and response. The book ensures that every facet of security required by an organization is linked to business objectives, and provides metrics to measure it. Case studies effectively demonstrate specific ways that metrics can be implemented across an enterprise to maximize business benefit.

This is a particularly important concern for knowledge-intensive organisations, such as universities, as the effective conduct of their core teaching and research activities is becoming ever more reliant on the availability, integrity and accuracy of computer-based information resources. One increasingly important mechanism for reducing the occurrence of security breaches, and in so doing, protecting corporate information, is through the formulation and application of a formal information security policy (InSPy). Whilst a great deal has now been written about the importance and role of the information security policy, and approaches to its formulation and dissemination, there is relatively little empirical material that explicitly addresses the structure or content of security policies. The broad aim of the study, reported in this paper, is to fill this gap in the literature by critically examining the structure and content of authentic information security policies, rather than simply making general prescriptions about what they ought to contain. Having established the structure and key features of the reviewed policies, the paper critically explores the underlying conceptualisation of information security embedded in the policies. There are two important conclusions to be drawn from this study: (1) the wide diversity of disparate policies and standards in use is unlikely to foster a coherent approach to security management; and (2) the range of specific issues explicitly covered in university policies is surprisingly low, and reflects a highly techno-centric view of information security management. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most sensitive aspects every government should consider in the context of such a modernisation is the field of Justice. Although most of the procedures are highly inefficient they are proven to work and there is a very high risk involved in tampering with these or the data they deal with. The most prominent issue is guaranteeing that any information flowing within judicial electronic systems are treated securely. This paper identifies the most common security objectives being set in ICT enabled solutions for judicial environments; as found in several on-going and finished projects co-funded by the European Union (EU). These objectives are discussed within the context of Justice and the state-of-the-art of Information Security is presented as possible solutions. Finally, a number of security initiatives and organizations which try to standardise solutions and approaches to common challenges are discussed.","","International law; Electronic systems; European Commission; European union; Judicial systems; Security objectives; Security of data"

Trust has aspects of an attitude, an attribution, an expectation, a feeling or belief, an intention, and a trait. Trust can be thought of as a family of relations, certainly not a single relation. Interpersonal trust is both fundamentally and subtly different from trust in automation. Threshold effects are reflected in the tendency to maintain a fixed level of reliance even as the level of trust changes, resulting in a dichotomous pattern of reliance. Cybersecurity and defense issues, including social deception, misdirection, influence, and manipulation, span all the venues of macrocognitive work in the Networld.

Compared to state-of-the-art protection mechanisms, our method does not require any code changes on either the client, the web-server or the back-end database. Rather, our system uses a proxy that seamlessly integrates with existing operational environments offering protection to front-end web servers and back-end databases. To evaluate the overhead and the detection performance of our system, we implemented a prototype of SQLProb which we tested using real SQL attacks. Our experimental results show that we can detect all SQL injection attacks while maintaining very low resource utilization.

The most consequential and highest risk threat is attack by one or more nation-states intent on projecting power, and who are willing to damage or destroy critical information infrastructure by cyber means in order to achieve this objective. Threat actors falling into this category have the necessary time, resources, sophistication, and access to do so. This category certainly includes cyber warfare. Today, nation-states are beginning to understand in concrete terms the potential benefits and costs of cyber attacks used as a means of projecting national power. It may not take a great deal of a nation's cyber resources, planning time, or technical access to achieve limited national objectives. In the U.S., cyber defense of critical infrastructures is largely a homeland security mission. It may be that defense always lags the most potent offense. But the goal is an effective defense, not a perfect one. To get ahead of the most serious national cybersecurity risks, including that of cyber warfare, a country's cybersecurity leadership must seek an appropriate balance of resources, energy, and focus between those threats that are most frequent and those that are most consequential. The historical bias in dealing with cyber risk has been to look at it through the lens of commerce, not national security-and to reinforce the emphasis on short-term thinking rather than long-term strategy. One way to overcome this bias is simply to emphasize efforts that mitigate the most consequential risks. A nation's cyber leadership could decide, for example, that it should apply significant early resources to mitigating the national security risk associated with defending critical infrastructure against nation-state threats. © 2009 The authors.","critical information infrastructure; cyber attacks; cyber risk; Cyber warfare; cybersecurity; cybersecurity policy; homeland security","Computer crime; Critical infrastructures; Network security; Public works; Security systems; Cyber security; Cyber warfare; Cyber-attacks; Homeland security missions; Information infrastructures; Long-term strategy; National governments; Potential benefits; National security"

Security breaches can carry destructive effects on economy and national security. Security related losses cost the US economy more than $ 60 Billion a year. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to provide security measures and implement them at various levels of the organization. Such measures are designed to protect information availability, confidentiality and integrity (ACI) of the organizational assets. In the last four decades, researchers have addressed all types of security measures and made available a variety of techniques which help organizations achieve their desired goals of security. Such measures include anti-virus programs, firewalls, encryption, coding techniques, port sniffing, reliable messaging, and many others. This paper presents a security assessment method which is designed to enable the organization or a third party auditor to evaluate the various levels of security required by the given organization, the current security measures used by the organization and the security gaps which need be taken care of.","","Knowledge management; Security of data; Anti-virus programs; Coding techniques; Destructive effects; Orthogonal method; Protect information; Reliable messaging; Security assessment; Security breaches; Crime"

The relative liberalization of the media in the early 1990s led to a media defeat of the Russian army during the First Chechen war. Consequently, in the second war, renewed control of the media was progressively established, the goal of which was to deny access to independent journalists, on one hand, and to set up a more efficient communication network, on the other. This restructured network encompassed the internal network of the armed forces but was also destined to serve the outer civilian world-the Rosinformtsentr was created to this end. The implementation of these measures intensified over the summer of 2000, finally culminating in the adoption of the Information Security Doctrine, the revamping of military media and the placement of siloviki members in certain media posts. By putting the army back on center stage and giving it a prominence that it had lacked ever since the end of the USSR, the government attempted to mobilize society around a nationally sanctioned idea. The army, which easily fell into its historically familiar role, which it had actually never fully relinquished, has been able to easily reactivate this military-patriotic tendency in the public and to thus propagate a form of traditional military thinking that tends to be resistant to reform. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Censorship; Communications; Embedding; Information; Media network; Militaristic; Restructure; Security doctrine",""

Within this framework, the content-based steganographic module is to hide patients' textual information into mammograms without changing the important details of the pictorial contents and to verify the authenticity and integrity of the mammograms. The reversible watermarking module, capable of masking the contents of mammograms, is for preventing unauthorized users from viewing the contents of the mammograms.

As these systems move away from closed environments and architectures to network connectivity and open and commodity technologies, they are exposed as never before to security threats that are familiar in the information systems realm. Security has become as necessary a property as high-reliability and fault-tolerance. On the information systems side, in Department of Defense parlance, fought on current terms, the information war is not only being lost, it is unwinnable. The ""detect-protect-respond"" paradigm is ""broken"", and there is a new strategy that shifts information assurance, computer network defense, and cyber security from attack prevention and preemption towards the ability to ""fight through""-survive- attacks. Survivability-resilience-is now the common thread running through both security-critical and safety-critical software engineering. Secure software developers need to adopt and adapt reliability and safety engineering techniques and tools to achieve survivability objectives in their larger, more complex information system programs and applications. Software safety engineers need to strike the balance between the emerging need for security and the unique imperatives of safety-critical software, and leverage tools and best practices originating in the information and software assurance communities.

Subtitle D of the HITECH Act includes key amendments to strengthen the privacy and security regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The HITECH act also states that ""the National Coordinator"" must consult with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in determining what standards are to be applied and enforced for compliance with HIPAA. This has led to speculation that NIST will recommend that the government impose the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) [2], which was created by NIST for application within the federal government, as requirements to the public Electronic Health Records (EHR) community in the USA.

The research community working on Information Security Governance are diverse and appears to be mis-aligned with the needs of the business community. The problem that this paper addresses is twofold. Firstly, it addresses the confusion regarding the meaning of Information Security Governance. Secondly, it assesses the gap between research and business communities from an Information Security Governance perspective. This article analyses the requirements from the business community and mapped it against current research outputs. Findings clearly indicate that the two worlds are not entirely aligned and that in some cases minimum effort is being spent on the topics deemed important by the business community.

These are the cardinality model, the second's model, which is based on vector space, and the last model is based on the priority principle. Each of these models will be presented with definitions, basic operations, and examples. All three models are based on a new theory to understand information security called the Information Security Sets Theory (ISST). The ISST is based on four basic sets: external sets, local strategy sets, local standard sets, and local implementation sets. It should be noted that two sets are used to create local standard sets—local expansion and local creation. The major differences between the Zermelo Fraenkel set theory and the ISST are the elimination of using empty element and empty set. This assumption is based on “there is not empty security” measure and the is substituted to be and is defined as “minimum security (or system default security)”. The main objective of this article is to achieve new modeling system for information security compliance. The compliance measurement is defined in the first model as the cardinality between local strategy sets and the actual local implementation. The second model is looking at the security compliance as the angle between two sets, local implementation and local standard. The third model is based on the priority philosophy for local security standard. © 2009, IGI Global.

However, after considering economic opportunity, IT infrastructure, international collaboration in enforcement and conventional crimes, we find strong evidence that cyber attacks were indeed spatially autocorrelated as they moved over time.

Previous studies using the Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM) have demonstrated the impact of cross-sectoral security incidents from the viewpoint of interdependency. However, the two primary limitations of these studies are that (1) they do not consider each sector's features in terms of information technology (IT) and information security (IS), and (2) they focus on the damage caused by IS incidents to sectors and do not consider the level of security interdependency itself. The author proposes a practical methodology to measure sectoral IS interdependency by introducing forward linkage and backward linkage analyses into an IIM. The methodology assesses the dependency of each sector with respect to IT and the level of IS measures. Furthermore, the paper applies the methodology to recent statistical economic data of Japanese industrial sectors and illustrates the implications of cross-sectoral security interdependency. © 2009 IEEE.","","Security of data; Software engineering; Economic activities; Industrial sector; Inoperability input-output model; Input output analysis; Linkage analysis; Security incident; Statistical economics; Industrial economics"

A color image with RGB space is firstly converted to its YCbCr space equivalent; a luminance (Y) image and two chrominance (Cb and Cr) images are subsequently transformed into contourlet domain respectively; the watermark is embedded into the contourlet coefficients of the largest detail subbands of three images lastly. On the one hand, the embedded watermark is imperceptible because contrast sensitivity function and watermark visual mask are adopted in our CAWCI. On the other hand, the embedded watermark is very robust due to the spread specialty of Laplacian pyramid (LP) in contourlet transform. The corresponding watermarking detection algorithm is proposed to decide whether the watermark is present or not by exploiting the unique transform structure of LP. Experimental results show the validity of CAWCI in terms of both watermarking invisibility and watermarking robustness.

As a consequence, security has become an essential aspect of IT and the negative impacts of security threats will affect not only systems or individuals but also organisations and society. In this paper, a priority indexing model (PIM) was proposed to evaluate organisation's information security system and to calculate a development priority index that can be used as an indicator for development needs. To examine the validity of the proposed model, the information security system in Ministry of Education (MOE) in the State of Kuwait was evaluated to determine the overall development priority indexes.

We present here some initial results from interviews with such professionals, focusing on those who operated in classified environments. In particular, we draw attention to the benefits to being monitored that these employees identified: increased feeling of personal security, the presence of someone to help prevent you from making mistakes, simplifying collaboration in some instances, and the presence of an audit trail for employee protection. We also outline some of the complicating factors that may diminish these benefits. While government monitoring often has a negative connotation, we demonstrate that there are cases when voluntary monitoring as a condition of employment can be seen to have advantages to the employee.","Employee monitoring; Information security professionals; Privacy","Data privacy; Economic and social effects; Mobile security; Monitoring; Security systems; Audit trails; Employee protection; Healthcare industry; Information security professionals; Personal security; Quality of life; Trade off; Security of data"

Managing non-financial risks is to a large extent the new frontier. Central banks face a very wide array of non-financial risks. A few of them, in particular those related to reputation, have actually an importance which is difficult to oversee or overstate. Still, while very significant effort and progress has been made during the past twenty years to provide tangible solutions for the most pressing and visible concerns related to information security, physical security or business continuity, the broader topic of operational risk management (ORM) has stayed in a relative stage of infancy. In recent times, however, unprecedented forces have spurred a new wave of ORM initiatives. In an era where they encourage commercial banks to improve risk management in general and ORM in particular, central banks are more than ever committed to enhance their own competency and demonstrate that they fully practice what they preach. Faced with reinforced scrutiny on the use of public money, they strive to overcome their traditional bias towards risk aversion and further embrace values of effectiveness and efficiency through formal ORM frameworks and explicit risk tolerance policies. Last but not least, in a complex and uncertain new business environment featuring integrated financial markets and infrastructures, digital convergence and development of web-centric applications, and more generally emerging threats of the era of globalization (e.g. international terrorism, criminality or pandemic issues), central banks are resolutely starting to take a fresh and comprehensive look at the key non-financial risks which may compromise their ultimate objectives. © Cambridge University Press 2009.","",""

Further, the ever-growing dependence of organisations on technology to drive businesses and to create a competitive advantage makes IS management for organisations extremely challenging.

As a mixed blessing, however, the information sharing process also exposes information systems to more severe virus attacks. In light of this, research efforts on virus propagation and virus control have drawn increasing interests in both the academic and industrial domains. This paper thus presents a virus propagation model, namely E-SEIR, to gain insights of virus propagation in networks with Point-to-Group (P2G) information sharing patterns. Unlike most existing virus propagation models, E-SEIR has three important characteristics. First, an additional exposed state is integrated into the model to describe the latent period of computer viruses. Second, a P2G infection function is introduced to the model to characterize the real-world networks, which consist of many information-sharing sub-networks. Third, E-SEIR takes various antivirus countermeasures into consideration, which provides unique opportunities for studying the behaviors of virus propagation with the presence of antivirus activities. Based on this E-SEIR model, we have studied the possibility of short-term virus outbreaks and long-term network survivability, and the results revealed some key managerial insights that are helpful for the practice of virus propagation control in information sharing networks. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Even though information security can be accomplished with the help of a prevailing tool like cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the cryptographic keys is one of the significant issues to be deal with. This predicament can be efficiently solved by the integration of biometrics with cryptography. Of late, the enhanced performance of cryptographic key generated from biometrics in terms of security has obtained massive reputation amongst the researchers and experimenters. However, there is a permanent association between the biometric and the user, in which modification is impossible. Hence, the biometric is gone eternally and possibly for all the applications which apply it, if there is a compromise of the biometric identifier. This may be solved by the construction of revocable biometric templates through cancelable biometrics. In this paper, we have proposed an approach to generate irrevocable cryptographic key from cancelable fingerprint templates, which performs in an efficient manner. Initially, the fingerprints are employed to extract the minutiae points which are transformed in an efficient manner to obtain deformed points. Subsequently, the deformed points are employed to generate the cancelable templates which are utilized for the extraction of irrevocable keys. It is highly impractical to acquire cancelable fingerprint templates and original fingerprints from the generated key owing to the fact that cryptographic key generated is irrevocable. We have utilized the fingerprints accessible from open sources to evaluate the efficacy of our approach. In addition, the protection analysis of the proposed method has been presented. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.","Biometric cryptosystems; Biometrics; Cancelable biometrics; Cryptography; Fingerprint; Irrevocable key; Key generation; Minutiae points",""

However, there is still the risk of loss of information arising in the lost of decrypted key. Therefore, we propose an optical holographic encrypted scheme based on deterministic phase encoding multiplexing by using a lenticular lens sheet. The modulation can be controlled by the author in the reference wave phase. It is possible to achieve the decryption of encrypted information even the key is lost. In this work, the results including the computer simulation and optical experiment demonstrate that the decryption still be severely performed. That is, the angular tolerance presented in the experimental results of decryption is 0.5° against the optical axis, the shift tolerance is 9μm along the optical axis.

The corresponding prior estimates are given to fill them up. Then, the algorithm of grey relational decision-making is applied to estimate information security risk.

We examine whether this disconnect has lead to a misalignment of IT security requirements in businesses versus industry standards and academic research. We conducted 13 interviews with practitioners from 9 different firms to investigate this question. The results present evidence for a significant gap between security requirements in industry standards and actually reported security vulnerabilities.

The paper discusses the pedagogical challenges related to education of high rank officers and similar personnel in light of recently-held courses and contrasts the course relative to similar undertakings.

BII measures the extent of use of IT by an organization in its products and value chain. Design/methodology/approach The paper develops a conceptual model that uses BII and CDR to examine alternative approaches to risk management. This model contains four quadrants that provide insight into varying risk management strategies for business processes. CFOs and internal auditors from Fortune 100 companies are surveyed to illustrate how the model may be used to guide management in assessing IT security expenditure. Findings The model suggests that spending on IT and information security is higher for companies with high BIICDR than those with low BIICDR. Research limitations/implications Analysis focused on only two quadrants in a fourquadrant model. Future research may seek to refine the measurement of BII and CDR, and offer greater insight into the types of business processes that fall into each of the four quadrants as well as those that do not fit neatly into those quadrants. Practical implications Organizations may use the BIICDR model to assess risk and to evaluate investments in IT security and other control activities. The model also highlights the need to redefine the concept of materiality and to consider its link to BII and CDR. Auditors should consider the interaction of BII and CDR in planning the audit, conducting field work, and managing overall audit risk. Originality/value The paper provides original insights into the relationship between BII and CDR and its implications for treatment of materiality. It was observed that activities which support critical business processes are themselves critical. This is an important departure from traditional approaches to evaluating materiality. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Data security; Information control; Internal auditing; Risk management",""

Generally, information security can be addressed from two angles - facilitating end-user precautions and enforcement against attackers. We show that, enforcement is more effective as an all-round policy to enhance information security. Facilitating user precautions leads to increased precautions and increased end-user demand, which have conflicting effects on the total harm suffered by end-users. Hence, reduced form estimates of the impact of facilitating precautions may over- or underestimate the impact, depending on which effect is stronger. Further, in targeted attacks, the outcome of interaction between users and attackers depends on the specific cost functions.

According to our study results, internet users' information privacy behaviors are affected by two significant factors: (1) users' perceived importance of information privacy and (2) information privacy self-efficacy. The study also found that users believe in the value of online information privacy and that information privacy protection behavior varies by gender.

Wireless networks, by their natures, are more vulnerable to external intrusions than wired ones. Therefore, many applications demand authenticating the integrity of multimedia content delivered wirelessly. In this work, we propose a framework for jointly authenticating and coding multimedia to be transmitted over heterogeneous wireless networks. We firstly provide a novel graph-based authentication scheme which can not only construct the authentication graph flexibly but also trade-off well among some practical requirements such as overhead, robustness and delay. And then, a rate-distortion optimized joint source-channel coding (JSCC) approach for error-resilient scalable encoded video is presented, in which the video is encoded into multiple independent streams and each stream is assigned forward error correction (FEC) codes to avoid error propagation. Furthermore, we consider integrating authentication with the specific JSCC scheme to achieve a satisfactory authentication results and end-to-end reconstruction quality by optimally applying the appropriate authentication and coding rate. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed authentication-coding scheme for multimedia over wireless networks. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Authentication; Joint source-channel coding; Multimedia security; Wireless networks","Authentication; Channel coding; Codes (symbols); Economic and social effects; Electric distortion; Error correction; Graphic methods; Heterogeneous networks; Network coding; Scalable video coding; Signal distortion; Wireless networks; Forward error correction codes; Heterogeneous wireless network; Joint source-channel coding; Multimedia over wireless networks; Multimedia security; Practical requirements; Reconstruction quality; Wireless transmissions; Network security"

Cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures, hash function, proxy certificate and attribute certificate, are utilized for protecting both intelligent agents and agent platforms. Countermeasures to agent protections and agent platform protection are given, which are based on information security mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, access control and confidentiality.

Our study is informed by the literature on IS adoption, protection-motivation theory, deterrence theory, and organisational behaviour, and is motivated by the fundamental premise that the adoption of information security practices and policies is affected by organisational, environmental, and behavioural factors. We develop an Integrated Protection Motivation and Deterrence model of security policy compliance under the umbrella of Taylor-Todd's Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of organisational commitment on employee security compliance intentions. Finally, we empirically test the theoretical model with a data set representing the survey responses of 312 employees from 78 organisations. Our results suggest that (a) threat perceptions about the severity of breaches and response perceptions of response efficacy, self-efficacy, and response costs are likely to affect policy attitudes; (b) organisational commitment and social influence have a significant impact on compliance intentions; and (c) resource availability is a significant factor in enhancing self-efficacy, which in turn, is a significant predictor of policy compliance intentions.

Borrowing from the idea that the transmission reliability can be improved with error correction code in classical communications, a novel BB84 key distribution protocol is designed based on quantum LDPC in this paper. By numerical simulation, the effect of quantum error correction code on BB84 protocol is analyzed in the case of the transmission efficiency. The results show that quantum LDPC codes have good ability to overcome the noise, raise the transmission efficiency, and verify the availability of the proposed model.","Information security; Key transmission efficiency; Quantum key distribution protocol; Quantum Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code","Data communication equipment; Electric power transmission; Error correction; Public key cryptography; Quantum chemistry; Quantum cryptography; BB84 protocols; Classical communications; Error correction codes; High keys; Information security; Key distributions; Key transmission efficiency; Key-distribution protocols; Ldpc codes; Numerical simulations; Quantum channels; Quantum error correction codes; Quantum error corrections; Quantum key distribution protocol; Quantum Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code; Transmission reliabilities; Quantum efficiency"

To be effective, passwords should be strong, secret, and memorable. While password strength can be enforced by automated information technology policies, users frequently jeopardize secrecy to improve memorability. The password memorability problem is exacerbated by the number of different passwords a user is required to remember. While short-term memory theories have been applied to individual-password management problems, the relationship between memory and the multiple-password problem has not been examined. This paper treats the multiple-password management crisis as a search and retrieval problem involving human beings long-term memory. We propose that interference between different passwords is one of the major challenges to multiple-password recall and that interference alleviation methods can significantly improve multiple-password recall. A lab experiment was conducted to examine the effectiveness of two interference alleviation methods: the list reduction method and the unique identifier method. While both methods improve multiple-password recall performance, the list reduction method leads to statistically significant improvement. The results demonstrate the potential merit of practices targeting multiple-password interference. By introducing long-term memory theory to multiple-password memorability issues, this study presents implications benefiting users and serves as the potential starting point for future research. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Data protection is important for all information systems that deal with human-subjects data. Grid-based systems such as the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) seek to develop new mechanisms to facilitate real-time federation of cancer-relevant data sources, including sources protected under a variety of regulatory laws, such as HIPAA and 21CFR11. These systems embody new models for data sharing, and hence pose new challenges to the regulatory community, and to those who would develop or adopt them. These challenges must be understood by both systems developers and system adopters. In this paper, we describe our work collecting policy statements, expectations, and requirements from regulatory decision makers at academic cancer centers in the United States. We use these statements to examine fundamental assumptions regarding data sharing using data federations and grid computing. Methods. An interview-based study of key stakeholders from a sample of US cancer centers. Interviews were structured, and used an instrument that was developed for the purpose of this study. The instrument included a set of problem scenarios difficult policy situations that were derived during a full-day discussion of potentially problematic issues by a set of project participants with diverse expertise. Each problem scenario included a set of open-ended questions that were designed to elucidate stakeholder opinions and concerns. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, data was aggregated at the individual or institutional unit of analysis, depending on the specific interview question. Results. Thirty-one (31) individuals at six cancer centers were contacted to participate. Twenty-four out of thirty-one (24/31) individuals responded to our request- yielding a total response rate of 77%. Respondents included IRB directors and policy-makers, privacy and security officers, directors of offices of research, information security officers and university legal counsel. Nineteen total interviews were conducted over a period of 16 weeks. Respondents provided answers for all four scenarios (a total of 87 questions). Results were grouped by broad themes, including among others: governance, legal and financial issues, partnership agreements, de-identification, institutional technical infrastructure for security and privacy protection, training, risk management, auditing, IRB issues, and patient/subject consent. Conclusion. The findings suggest that with additional work, large scale federated sharing of data within a regulated environment is possible. A key challenge is developing suitable models for authentication and authorization practices within a federated environment. Authentication the recognition and validation of a person's identity is in fact a global property of such systems, while authorization the permission to access data or resources mimics data sharing agreements in being best served at a local level. Nine specific recommendations result from the work and are discussed in detail. These include: (1) the necessity to construct separate legal or corporate entities for governance of federated sharing initiatives on this scale; (2) consensus on the treatment of foreign and commercial partnerships; (3) the development of risk models and risk management processes; (4) development of technical infrastructure to support the credentialing process associated with research including human subjects; (5) exploring the feasibility of developing large-scale, federated honest broker approaches; (6) the development of suitable, federated identity provisioning processes to support federated authentication and authorization; (7) community development of requisite HIPAA and research ethics training modules by federation members; (8) the recognition of the need for central auditing requirements and authority, and; (9) use of two-protocol data exchange models where possible in the federation. © 2009 Manion et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Biomedical Research; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Databases, Factual; Decision Making, Organizational; Governing Board; Government Regulation; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; Humans; Intellectual Property; Interviews as Topic; Medical Oncology; Organizational Policy; United States; accreditation; article; cancer center; controlled study; financial management; hospital policy; human; institutional review; insurance; legal aspect; medical audit; medical expert; medical informatics; organization and management; privacy; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; risk management; structured interview; training; United States; board of trustees; clinical trial; computer network; computer security; confidentiality; factual database; government regulation; health insurance; interview; medical research; multicenter study; oncology; organization; patent; policy; standard"

The common practice of using a layered security architecture that has multiple technologies amplifies the need for proper configuration because the configuration decision about one security technology has ramifications for the configuration decisions about others. Furthermore, security technologies rely on each other for their operations, thereby affecting each other's contribution. In this paper we study configuration of and interaction between a firewall and intrusion detection systems (IDS). We show that deploying a technology, whether it is the firewall or the IDS, could hurt the firm if the configuration is not optimized for the firm's environment. A more serious consequence of deploying the two technologies with suboptimal configurations is that even if the firm could benefit when each is deployed alone, the firm could be hurt by deploying both. Configuring the IDS and the firewall optimally eliminates the conflict between them, ensuring that if the firm benefits from deploying each of these technologies when deployed alone, it will always benefit from deploying both. When optimally configured, we find that these technologies complement or substitute each other. Furthermore, we find that while the optimal configuration of an IDS does not change whether it is deployed alone or together with a firewall, the optimal configuration of a firewall has a lower detection rate (i.e., allowing more access) when it is deployed with an IDS than when deployed alone. Our results highlight the complex interactions between firewall and IDS technologies when they are used together in a security architecture, and, hence, the need for proper configuration to benefit from these technologies. ©2009 INFORMS.","Analytical modeling; Economics of information systems; Firewalls; Information security; Information security technologies; Intrusion detection systems; Software configuration","Analytical models; Computer crime; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Network function virtualization; Economics of information; Information security technologies; Intrusion Detection Systems; Layered security; Multiple technology; Security Architecture; Security technology; Software configuration; Security of data"

As a result, information security awareness is becoming an important issue to anyone using the Internet. To reduce losses, organizations have made information security awareness a top priority. The three main barriers to information security awareness are: (1) general security awareness, (2) employees' computer skills, and (3) organizational budgets. Online learning appears a feasible alternative to providing information security awareness and countering these three barriers. Research has identified three levels of security awareness: perception, comprehension and projection. This paper reports on a laboratory experiment that investigates the impacts of hypermedia, multimedia and hypertext to increase information security awareness among the three awareness levels in an online training environment. The results indicate that: (1) learners who have the better understanding at the perception and comprehension levels can improve understanding at the projection level; (2) learners with text material perform better at the perception level; and (3) learners with multimedia material perform better at the comprehension level and projection level. The results could be used by educators and training designers to create meaningful information security awareness materials. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Among current biometric approaches, iris recognition is known for an inherently reliable technique to identify one's identity. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), a multi-resolution decomposition technique, is adaptive for non-linear and non-stationary data analysis, and therefore would be suitable for iris pattern extraction. This paper presents an effective approach for iris recognition using the proposed scheme of Modified Empirical Mode Decomposition to analyze the iris signals locally. Based on EMD that is a fully data-driven method and does not use any pre-determined filter or wavelet function, an iris recognition scheme is presented by adopting Modified EMD as a low-pass filter for feature extraction. To evaluate the proposed approach, three different similarity measures are used. Experimental results show that those three metrics have achieved promising and similar performance. Therefore, the proposed method demonstrates to be feasible for iris recognition and Modified EMD is suitable for feature extraction.","Biometrics; Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Iris recognition; Multi-resolution decomposition",""

The authors prove that Canetti's concept of UC emulation and the concept of Dolev-Yao emulation are almost sufficient-and-necessarily dual each other with respect to integrating UC theory and strand symbolic model (Dolev-Yao style), and this analysis framework is proven both sound and complete in this case.

The new model works through analysis monitored behavior data by sensors directly, changes the traditional modeling thoughts, brakes away from the fetter of various subjective assumptions in traditional modeling methods, and overcomes the problem of inadequate handling capacity for multi-source behavior data in the traditional trust model.

Using an organizational control lens, we build a model to explain individual information security precaution-taking behavior. Specific hypotheses are developed and tested using a field survey. We examine elements of control and introduce the concept of mandatoriness, which we define as the degree to which individuals perceive that compliance with existing security policies and procedures is compulsory or expected by organizational management. We find that the acts of specifying policies and evaluating behaviors are effective in convincing individuals that security policies are mandatory.

One of the key aspects here is establishing the correct mindset, and ensuring that people are working for (or at least with) security rather than against it. Unfortunately, people are very often perceived as an obstacle rather than an asset in this regard. Indeed, to quote an Information Security magazine survey from a few years ago, one of the biggest hurdles for organisations to overcome in their attempts to address security is the problem of ""unalert, uninterested, lax, ignorant, uncaring end users"".1. One of the most prevalent problems when protecting information assets is the apathetic attitude, and resulting actions and behaviour, of employees. Given that the corporate culture of an organisation shapes the beliefs and values of those within it, it becomes essential to address the mindsets of employees and ensure that relevant security knowledge and skills are communicated to them. However, organisations cannot assume a uniform starting point; employees will have varying degrees of compliance that may evolve to become more compliant or more disobedient depending on the guidance provided by management. This article examines the levels of security acceptance that can exist amongst employees within an organisation, and how these levels relate to three recognised levels of corporate culture. It then proceeds to identify several factors that could be relevant to the development of culture, from traditional awareness-raising techniques through to context-aware promotion of security. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, legitimate tasks referring to the incorrect data will further corrupt more data objects in the system. As a result, the integrity level of the system can be seriously compromised. This problem cannot be efficiently solved by existing defense mechanisms, such as access control, intrusion detection, and checkpoints. In this paper, we propose a practical solution for on-line attack recovery of workflows. The recovery system discovers all damages caused by the malicious tasks and automatically repairs the damages based on data and control dependencies between workflow tasks. We describe fundamental theories for workflow attack recovery system. Based on these theories, we build a prototype system and develop the corresponding recovery algorithms.

We address this research gap by proposing a theoretical model that explains non-compliance in terms of moral reasoning and values. The model integrates two well-known psychological theories: the Theory of Cognitive Moral Development by Kohlberg and the Theory of Motivational Types of Values by Schwartz.

Traditionally a symmetric key is initially shared between the two communicating nodes via a public key cryptography.

However security of the system can be enhanced if the single shared key is replaced by a bunch of keys together with a mechanism to determine the sequence in which the keys are used. In this way, the session is not compromised just by cracking a single key and a high level of security is assured and number of communications involved between the two communicators in order to exchange the symmetric key is decreased.

As a tool for improving the effectiveness of land cultivation, land consolidation plays an important role in enlarging farming plots and enhancing crop productivity. To fulfill land consolidation, more and more remote sensing images are widely used. This paper presents a LSB watermarking algorithm to protect the images data security. In the proposed scheme, the land reorganization planning map is embedded into a remote sensing image of the same area for information security and copyright protection. Before being embedded, the land reorganization planning map is compressively encoded. The contradiction between large information quantity and invisibility of digital water marking is perfectly eliminated. To avoid the shortcoming of being easily attacked in the original LSB method, the host image is preprocessed by exclusive-OR (XOR) operation. That is, the value of the least significant bit is decided by the XOR result of the first several bits. The watermark signal is embedded into the LSB of the processed host image by XOR operation. Moreover, by applying an optimal adjustment process, the watermarked image has the ability of distortion tolerance. The experimental results fully illustrate that the embedded watermark is not only imperceptible to the human eyes, but also has better security in the statistical sense. Moreover, the proposed scheme is superior in terms of its distortion tolerance.","Data protection; Exclusive-OR (XOR) operation; Land consolidation; Land reorganization planning map; Least significant bit (LSB); Remote sensing image; Watermarking","Copyrights; Digital watermarking; Image reconstruction; Military photography; Remote sensing; Watermarking; Data protection; Exclusive-OR (XOR) operation; Land consolidation; Land reorganization planning map; Least significant bit (LSB); Remote sensing image; Security of data"

This newly introduced extra layer ofsecurity changes the format ofnormal encrypted message and the security layer followed by it embeds the encrypted message behind a multimedia cover object. ©2009 IEEE.","Cryptography; Information; Security; Security layer; Steganography; Text","Cryptography; Telephone systems; Information; Security; Security layer; Steganography; Text; Network security"

Bot armies pose one of the most serious security threats to all networks. Botnets, remotely controlled and operated by botmasters or botherders, can launch massive denial of service attacks, multiple penetration attacks, or any other malicious network activity on a massive scale. Bot army activity has, in the past, been limited to fraud, blackmail, and other forms of criminal activity. However, their potential has been underestimated for causing large-scale damage to the entire Internet; for launching large-scale, coordinated attacks on government computers and networks; and for large-scale, coordinated data gathering from thousands of users and computers on any network. In a ""botnet"" or ""bot army"", computers can be used to spread spam, launch denial-of-service attacks against Web sites, conduct fraudulent activities, and prevent authorized network traffic from traversing the network. This paper will not discuss how to build bots but the threats they pose. In this paper, we examine the need for botnet defense training within existing simulation environments and present our suggestions for the capabilities needed for training systems for botnet activities. This paper discusses botnet technology and reviews the technologies that underlie this threat to network, information, and computer security.

It is clear that SOA addresses many challenges that face the DoD from information sharing to the fiscal issues of maintaining an IT infrastructure (networks, routers, desktops, peripherals, technology refresh, etc). Many large enterprises have investigated SOA, and have or will embrace it as a strategic course, no matter what underlying technology is used. However, SOA cannot be realized without the application of tried and true Systems Engineering principles with a balance between process and agility. The bottom line is that SOA must deliver a solution that crosses organizational, political and cultural boundaries as well as address the issues of information sharing regardless of where that information is actually stored. When the DoD reaches a SOA solution that supports the enterprise, the IT investments decisions should be much easier and affordable. The overall affect to programs should be easier to share, easier to enhance, easier to upgrade, easier to extend and ubiquitous data access across the enterprise.

The world is fraught with stifling inequalities, both from an economic as well as socio-political perspective. The net result has been large capability gaps between various organizational locations that need to work together, which has raised new challenges for information security teams. Similar issues arise, when mergers and acquisitions among and between organizations take place. While integrating remote business locations with mainstream operations, one or more of the issues including the lack of application level support, computational capabilities, communication limitations, and legal requirements cause a serious impediment thereby complicating integration while not violating the organizations' security requirements. Often resorted techniques like IPSec, tunneling, secure socket layer, etc. may not be always techno-economically feasible. This paper addresses such security issues by introducing an intermediate server between corporate central server and remote sites, called stand-off-server. We present techniques such as break-before-make connection, break connection after transfer, multiple virtual machine instances with different operating systems using the concept of a stand-off-server.

Although most organizations have long been using security technologies, it is well known that technology tools alone are not sufficient. Thus, the area of end-user security behaviors in organizations has gained an increased attention. In information security observing end-user security behaviors is challenging. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the end users have divergent security views. The inability to monitor employee IT security behaviors and divergent views regarding security policies, in our view, provide a setting where the principal agent paradigm applies. In this paper, we develop and test a theoretical model of the incentive effects of penalties, pressures and perceived effectiveness of employee actions that enhances our understanding of employee compliance to information security policies. Based on 312 employee responses from 77 organizations, we empirically validate and test the model. Our findings suggest that security behaviors can be influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. Pressures exerted by subjective norms and peer behaviors influence employee information security behaviors. Intrinsic motivation of employee perceived effectiveness of their actions was also found to play an important role in security policy compliance intentions. In analyzing the penalties, certainty of detection was found to be significant while surprisingly, severity of punishment was found to have a negative effect on security behavior intentions. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","End-user security behaviors; Information security; Principal agent theory; Security policy compliance","Personnel; Security systems; Societies and institutions; End-user security behaviors; Information security; Information security policies; Information-intensive organizations; Intrinsic motivations; IT securities; Management of information systems; Principal agent theory; Principal agents; Security policy compliance; Security technologies; Subjective norms; Theoretical models; Theory and practices; Security of data"

Second, detect stego-images that only contain a very small amount of secret data. Third, develop universal detectors or classifiers to carry out steganalysis independent of the steganographic scheme.

Data leakage vectors are increasing due to insider ingenuity, the proliferation of applications and peripherals, and financially motivated theft. So perhaps we need a new approach? Richard Walters of Overtis explores the concept of security convergence, whereby the disparate security systems and software at the organisations' disposal are integrated to provide a holistic security solution. Combining IDS, access control, CCTV, RFID, biometric authentication and others, it's possible to control the logical and the physical worlds to prevent data leakage. But security convergence still has obstacles to overcome. Let's not overlook the need to segment sensitive systems, use the endpoint rather than the network as our starting point and the need for industry standard APIs, he concludes. Data loss continues to grab the headlines. For those of us in the information security industry, these stories are testament to the fact that we are failing. Data is being removed intentionally, and disseminated unintentionally, from UK organisations on an unprecedented scale. Examples we've seen range from gaining physical access to restricted areas (through access card theft, lack of anti-passback on turnstiles, and plain simple tailgating), to data theft over instant messenger using file transfer, and social networking sites (uploading a file from the corporate network during office hours, and downloading it to another location later). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Generic data encryption standards, such as DES, RSA, AES, are not very efficient in the encryption of multimedia contents due to the large volume. In order to address this issue, different image/video encryption methodologies have been developed. These methodologies encrypt only the key parameters of image/video data instead of encrypting it as a bitstream. Joint compression-encryption is a very promising direction for image/video encryption. Nowadays, researchers start to utilize information hiding techniques to enhance the security level of data encryption methodologies. Information hiding conceals not only the content of the secret message, but also its very existence. In terms of the amount of data to be embedded, information hiding methodologies can be classified into low bitrate and high bitrate algorithms. In terms of the domain for embedding, they can be classified into spatial domain and transform domain algorithms. Different categories of information hiding methodologies, as well as data embedding and watermarking strategies for digital video contents, will be reviewed. A joint cryptograph-steganography methodology, which combines both encryption and information hiding techniques to ensure patient information security and privacy in medical images, is also presented.

However, at present, not enough attention is being paid on measuring the effectiveness of these controls and overall state of security in the institution. In this study, attempt is made to build a metric based assessment and reporting plan, specific to the needs of an academic environment. Proposed assessment metric facilitates iterative implementation, by prioritizing each metric. Secondly, to reduce response time, a novel approach of pointed reporting is suggested, where responsibilities are distributed across the institution, based on relevant roles. In this approach, security exceptions are reported directly to the predefined roles, responsible for that particular security control. This pointed reporting, delivers message to the right person in minimum time, resulting in improved response time. The proposed assessment metric and pointed reporting structure, will improve overall security governance. As security measures and practices can be assessed systematically and remedial actions can be taken in less time, which is so crucial for effective security governance. © 2009 IEEE.","Distributed defense; Information security; Iterative implementation; Pointed reporting; Security assessment","Metric system; Risk management; Security of data; Distributed defense; Information security; Iterative implementation; Pointed reporting; Security assessment; Risk assessment"

The challenge that we face is determining how to specify the information assurance requirements for a system without requiring changes to the commercial software and in light of the interdependencies between systems. As a result of the interdependencies and interconnections between systems introduced by the global information grid (GIG), an assessment of the IA requirements for a system must consider three facets of a system's IA capabilities: 1) the IA vulnerabilities of the system, 2) the ability of a system to repel IA attacks, and 3) the ability of a system to insure that any IA attack that penetrates the system is contained within the system and does not spread. Each facet should be assessed independently and the requirements should be derived independently from the assessments. In addition to the desired IA technology capabilities of the system, a complete assessment of the system's overall IA security technology readiness level cannot be accomplished without an assessment of the capabilities required of the system for its capability to recover from and remediate IA vulnerabilities and compromises. To allow us to accomplish these three formidable tasks, we propose a general system architecture designed to separate the system's IA capabilities from its other capability requirements; thereby allowing the IA capabilities to be developed and assessed separately from the other system capabilities. The architecture also enables independent requirements specification, implementation, assessment, measurement, and improvement of a system's IA capabilities without requiring modification of the underlying application software. © 2009 SPIE.","","Computer software; Information management; Intrusion detection; Mining; Software architecture; Specifications; Application softwares; Commercial software; Department of Defense; Global information grid; Information assurance; Requirements specifications; Security technology; Software systems; System architectures; System capabilities; Information technology"

However, with the proliferation of mobile computing, it is being frequently observed that the RBAC access decision is directly influenced by the spatiotemporal context of both the subjects and the objects in the system. Currently, there are only a few models (STRBAC, GSTRBAC) in place which specify spatiotemporal security policy on top of the classical RBAC. In this paper we propose a complete RBAC model in spatiotemporal domain based on the idea of spatiotemporal extent. The concept of spatiotemporal role extent and spatiotemporal permission extent introduced here enables our model to specify granular spatiotemporal access control policies not specifiable in the existing approaches. Our model is also powerful enough to incorporate classical role hierarchy and other useful RBAC policies including Role based Separation of Duty and Permission based Separation of Duty in spatiotemporal domain. Healthcare is an area in which information security is of utmost importance. The risk of personal medical data leakage is especially high in mobile healthcare applications. As a proof of concept, we have implemented the proposed spatiotemporal access control method in a mobile telemedicine system. ©Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.","Permission Extent; Role Extent; Spatiotemporal Domain; Spatiotemporal SOD and Telemedicine","Computer science; Health care; Mobile computing; Security systems; Telemedicine; Access control policies; Access decision; Information security; Medical data; Mobile applications; Mobile health care; Mobile telemedicine system; Permission Extent; Proof of concept; RBAC model; RBAC policy; Resource protection; Role Extent; Role hierarchy; Role-based; Role-based Access Control; Security policy; Separation of duty; Spatiotemporal Domain; Spatiotemporal SOD and Telemedicine; Access control"

We develop a theoretical model of user behaviour based on the framework of the theory of planned behaviour and national cultural dimensions and indices. We posit that cultural factors moderate the strength of the relationships in the behavioural model in the context of protective information technologies. The model was then empirically tested using structural equation modelling techniques in conjunction with multi-group analysis. Most of the hypothesized moderating effects of national cultural factors were found to be statistically significant. Our findings suggest that cultural factors should be considered in order to design effective information security policies, practices and technologies in global networks where multiple cultures coexist.

Network-based substation automation systems (SAS) are typical power information systems. Based on an analysis of the difficulties in asset identification, a complete information asset identifying method is proposed from three perspectives, including asset classification, business identification, and asset valuation. In asset classification, by referring to the IEC 61850 standard, a structured asset model is defined based on the association between actual intelligent electronic devices and virtual logical nodes. In business identification, with the functions of substation automation as the object of business, the concept of function graph is defined to reflect the logical relations between functions and assets, as well as the logical relation between the assets. In asset valuation, two levels of asset value including the function level and substation level, are defined to quantify the information security properties of assets and the effects of possible accidents. Finally, an evaluation instance is constructed according to the IEC 61850 standard for verification of the applicability of the method proposed to asset identification of network-based SAS.

These methods are usually used to compare all alternatives based on the synthesized scorings within a normalized scale with respect to the same criteria in multicriteria problems. However, the decision makers often simultaneously manage one or several alternatives/projects with conflicting and noncommensurable criteria to reduce the gaps to achieve the aspired grade in practice. They then need to rank the gaps that have not been reduced or improved (the unimproved gaps) for the alternatives/projects or aspects of a project to get the most benefit. Because these compared alternatives/projects do not usually have the same criteria/aspects, traditional methods are unsuitable to deal with them. Thus, this research proposes a new VIKOR method to solve this problem; this new method allows the decision maker to understand these gaps of the projects/aspects and rank them to improve these large gaps in control items to achieve the aspired level. Its concept originates in compromise solutions, in particular the VIKOR method. In addition, this research also provides an example of improving information security risk to demonstrate the suitability of this new method. The results show the effectiveness of the new method. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Compromise solution; Information security management system (ISMS); Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM); Residual risk; Risk assessment; VIKOR",""

Based on the shift concept of the classical Wu-Manber (WM) algorithm and combined with its features of hardware architecture, the ALPM adopts several pre-processing and matching strategies, such as utilizing two different Hash functions to access the Shift and hash tables, optimizing pre-processing to choose the best entry signs from patterns for the two tables and adjusting the Hash confliction dynamically with the Cache size and the pattern quantity, to improve the matching performance. The experimental results show that for the large-scale pattern set, the matching performance of the ALPM is 5-10 times higher than that of the classical WM.","Hash confliction; Large-scale pattern set; Multi-threading; Pattern matching; String matching","Hash functions; Pattern matching; Cache size; Fast string matching; Hardware architecture; Hash confliction; Hash table; Information security systems; Key technologies; Large-scale pattern set; Matching performance; Multi-threading; Pre-processing; Scale pattern; Shift-and; String matching; Set theory"

Consequently, the weak points in system security are identified. A stochastic model using measurable values to describe the information system security of a SCM is introduced. Information security is a crucial and integral part of the network of supply chains. Each chain or driver requires a different security level according to the services it contributes to the overall SCM system. Different probabilistic weights are assigned to the four goals CIAA of security depending on the SCM driver's mission. A Semi-Markov chain model is used to describe the probabilistic nature of different security levels for each driver in the system. A comparison of the steady-state security for a multi-driver model with different levels of attack is performed, and the results analyzed. Enhanced supply chain security could be achieved by identifying the effects of attacks on the security goals of an organization. The use of this model helps to identify weak points in supply chain system security, and offers hints on how to strengthen them. The model is tested by considering intrusion scenarios representing different levels of attack on the SCM system. An analysis of the results is performed using an interactive application.

Also, solutions to the most challenging issue in applying the fuzzy vault to fingerprint have been proposed. One of the solutions exploits the idea of the geometric hashing to solve the auto-alignment problem. in this paper, we analyze the feature distribution of the generated hash table as a stored fingerprint template and improve the security of the geometric hashingbased fuzzy vault by uniformly distributing the features in the stored fingerprint template. That is, after analyzing the geometric transform from the real and chaff minutiae in the fingerprint image to the generated hash table, we modify the way to add the chaff minutiae. The goals of this addition make the feature distribution of the hash table for the chaff minutiae similar to that of the real minutiae as well as the feature distribution of the fingerprint image for both types of minutiae uniform. Based on the experimental results, we confirm that the proposed approach can perform the fingerprint verification more securely without a significant degradation of the verification accuracy.","Crypto-biometric; Fingerprint verification; Fuzzy vault; Geometric hashing; Information security","Crypto-biometric; Fingerprint verification; Fuzzy vault; Geometric hashing; Information security; Biometrics"

This technology, combined with the appropriate cryptographic methods, effectively prevents the content against malicious attacks, so as to protect its authenticity as well as integrity. While encryption-based security is ensuring the authorised consumption of the multimedia content, content adaptation technologies have the primary goal of providing means for wider dissemination of the content across diverse networks, devices and users, and thus enriching user satisfaction and experience of the delivered content within a given set of usage environment constraints. Traditionally, protected contents can only be adapted at trusted adaptation engines residing between the source and end-users, since they have to be fully decrypted before performing the necessary adaptation operations. The drawback of such a process is that it significantly limits the availability and flexibility of adaptation engines applicable for adapting protected contents on the fly. Thus, this paper proposes a novel scalable H.264/advanced video coding (AVC)-compatible video encryption technique, which is also transparent to adaptation engines in an end-to-end video delivery scenario. The proposed technology relies on keeping syntax elements required for performing the adaptation operations clear (i.e., not encrypted). The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been successfully verified in scenarios, where both conventional joint scalable video model (JSVM) bit stream extracting and random packet dropping mechanisms are used. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The frequency test results indicate that the output generated by the CCTR mode had uniformity. The binary matrix rank, Run, spectral, non-overlapping template matching, overlapping template matching, Maurer's universal statistical test, Lempel-Ziv compression, linear complexity, serial, approximate entropy, cumulative sums, random excursions and random excursions variant tests results fulfilled the requirements all. Therefore, the CCTR mode has good pseudo- randomness, which the security of CCTR mode is verified by way of statistical evaluation.","Authentication mode; Block cipher algorithm; Cryptology; Information security; Statistical evaluation","Authentication; Function evaluation; Statistical tests; Template matching; Approximate entropy; Avalanche effects; Binary matrix; Block cipher algorithm; Block cipher modes; Block ciphers; Cryptology; Cumulative sums; Frequency tests; Information security; Linear complexity; Mode-based; Operation efficiencies; Pseudorandomness; Statistical evaluation; Strict avalanche; Test results; Public key cryptography"

As molecular switches convert input stimulations into output signals, the principles of binary Boolean logic can be applied to the signal transduction operated by molecules under appropriate conditions. Implementation of the most common Boolean functions (PASS, YES, NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR, and INH) with chemical systems is possible now. Holding these basic logic functions in hands, the chemists are devoting to novel computational architectures of complicated functions, as well information security in the molecular platform, to create a molecular analogue for every electronic product. A molecular 2:1 multiplexer comprises two photochromic moieties, dihydropyrene and dihydroindolizine units, linked to a central porphyrin to perform as a combinational circuit to connect any one of several possible inputs to an output. Molecular sequential logic requires the control of the kinetic behavior of the chemical system. A molecular keypad lock and crossword puzzles and logic memory are capable based on a molecular species in solution whose fluorescence is switched on only in response to a correct sequence of input signals, which are reminiscent of electronic keypad locks, a common security device that can control the opening of a door or a safe. An approach to the assembly of the biomolecular keypad lock using the enzyme-based networking system is also realized. Further, a molecular computing platform in defending against information risk is constructed, where chemical-encoded user identity information can be transmitted from sequential logic unit to combinational logic circuit, and hence resulting in the user-specific digital functionalities.","Molecular devices; Molecular fluorescent switch; Molecular logic function materials",""

There has been little discussion, to date, of the potential impact of inter-related technologies on prioritization decisions. Most studies have assumed that all technologies are mutually exclusive and that there are no relationships among the technologies. It is likely, however, that some technologies are inter-related at least to some degree. For example, computer hardware and electronics or Internet and information security are considered to be closely related. The overall rankings of low-demand technologies may, therefore, be different when their relationships to high-demand technologies are considered.

This paper investigates the evolution of information security; where it came from, where it is today and the direction in which it is moving. It is argued that information security is not about looking at the past in anger of an attack once faced; neither is it about looking at the present in fear of being attacked; nor about looking at the future with uncertainty about what might befall us. The message is that organisations and individuals must be alert at all times. Research conducted for this paper explored literature on past security issues to set the scene. This is followed by the assessment and analysis of information security publications in conjunction with surveys conducted in industry. Results obtained are compared and analysed, enabling the development of a comprehensive view regarding the current status of the information security landscape.

Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a field study to explore the work of computer network intrusion detection using multiple data collection methods, including semi-structured interviews, examination of security tools and resources, analysis of information security mailing list posts, and attendance at several domain-specific user group meetings. Findings The work practice of intrusion detection analysts involves both domain expertise of networking and security and a high degree of situated expertise and problem-solving activities that are not predefined and evolve with the dynamically changing context of the analyst's environment. This paper highlights the learning process needed to acquire these two types of knowledge, contrasting this work practice with that of computer systems administrators.

Most prior sensor-network research has focused on collecting and processing environmental data using a static topology and an application-aware infrastructure, whereas opportunistic sensing involves collecting, storing, processing and fusing large volumes of data related to everyday human activities. This highly dynamic and mobile setting, where humans are the central focus, presents new challenges for information security, because data originates from sensors carried by people- not tiny sensors thrown in the forest or attached to animals. In this paper we aim to instigate discussion of this critical issue, because opportunistic people-centric sensing will never succeed without adequate provisions for security and privacy. To that end, we outline several important challenges and suggest general solutions that hold promise in this new sensing paradigm.","","Animals; Communication systems; Industrial research; Sensor networks; Sensors; Wireless networks; Critical issues; Environmental data; General solutions; Human activities; Information security; Mobile settings; Security and privacy; Security challenges; Data processing"

This article proposed a computer virus propagation model to describe those viruses spreading through the P2P file-sharing network. This model took the files in the network as subjects instead of the computers, which are always adopted in the traditional models.

We answer this question by measuring the actual importance level of resources based on business processes. Therefore, this paper presents our novel business process-based resource importance determination method which provides ISRM with an efficient and powerful tool for deriving realistic resource importance figures solely from existing business processes.

At the carrier-content layer, the output of encrypt layer is embedded in the carrier syntactical, semantic and pragmatic planes respectively. Then the output of encrypt layer can be embedded in multiple carrier coding at carrier-code layer and in diverse carrier formats at carrier-format layer.

The region multiplexing is proposed to solve this problem. Since multiple images to be encrypted are located in different regions of each output plane, the noise arising from the effect of diffractive shadow can be suppressed. The corresponding phase retrieval algorithm is studied through theoretical analysis and computer simulations. After the whole iterations with the normal sequence, the image with the worst decrypted quality is compensated one by one. In this way, we can obtain the sequence of sub-iteration which is objectively suitable for the characters of multiple images to be encrypted. Based on this sequence, either an adjusting iteration after the whole iterations with the original sequence or completely changing the sequence of the whole iterations can be adopted. As a result, maintaining the advantage of the phase retrieval algorithm converging fast, both the quality of all decrypted multiple images and the multiplexing capacity of the system can be improved.","Fourier optics; Information security; Optical image encryption; Phase retrieval","Computer simulation; Geometrical optics; Multiplexing; Network security; Optical data processing; Image encryptions; Information security; Multiple image; Normal sequences; Optical image encryption; Phase encoding; Phase retrieval; Phase retrieval algorithm; Cryptography"

Design-methodology-approach The paper introduces a real-life case which is analysed to highlight how and where standards can and should be used in order to improve information security in process-oriented distributed healthcare. Findings In total, 11 flaws or problems in information security and process-orientation are identified. From these, six changes are suggested which address how information is handled, and how organizational routines should be standardized. Research limitations-implications The case setting is Swedish healthcare, but problems can be shared across international borders. The purpose is to highlight the issues at hand. Practical implications If suggested changes are implemented, healthcare processes will be more streamlined and focused on patients. Routines will be standardized and uncertainties thus removed in terms of how to act in certain situations.

Because of these competencies, the concept of mobile agent is widely used in many different fields, such as Internet business, wireless communication, and information security technologies and etc. In 1983, Akl and Taylor [1] suggested the concept of superkey to resolve the key management issues faced by the mobile agent.

The proposed paper would be based upon the studies of superkey and a hierarchical mobile agent model with addition of elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC). ECC enhances the mobile agent model, because of shorter key length and higher efficiency on encryption and decryption. All the related works would be presented in Section 2. After the background of our proposal is well described, we would aim to resolve the key management issue created by Volker and Mehrdad's model.

We propose an architecture capable of supporting the solution of the Net-Centric dilemma. This architecture, distributed and scalable, is compatible with Air Force's Metadata Environment initiative (MDE). In the proposed architecture the metadata tagged data items are used to construct a semantic map of how the information items are associated. Using this map, policy can be applied to information items. Provided the policy is logically based, reasoners can be used to identify not only if the person soliciting the data item has rights to receive it but also what kind of information can be derived from this data based on information retrieved previously. The full architecture includes the determination of which information can be relayed or not at any given time, as well as all the required mechanisms for enforcement including identification of potential intentional fraudulent actions. The proposed architecture is extensible and does not require any specific policy language or reasoner to be effective. Multiple approaches can be simultaneously present in the system. © 2009 SPIE.","Data access; Information assurance; Need-to-share; Semantic-aware","Access control; Metadata; Semantics; Air Force; Data access; Data items; Flow of data; Information assurance; Information items; Information policy; Metadata environment; Multi-level security; Need-to-share; Net-centric; Net-centric operations; Policy language; Proposed architectures; Reasoner; Semantic map; Tagged data; Information dissemination"

Allowing patient information to be in jeopardy may lead to irreparable damage, physically, morally, and socially to the patient, potentially shaking the credibility of the healthcare institution. Medical images play a crucial role in such context, given their importance in diagnosis, treatment, and research. Therefore, it is vital to take measures in order to prevent tampering and determine their provenance. This demands adoption of security mechanisms to assure information integrity and authenticity. There are a number of works done in this field, based on two major approaches: use of metadata and use of watermarking. However, there still are limitations for both approaches that must be properly addressed. This paper presents a new method using cryptographic means to improve trustworthiness of medical images, providing a stronger link between the image and the information on its integrity and authenticity, without compromising image quality to the end user.

In this study, a feature selection method based on Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) is presented to select feature subsets which not only contain fewer features, but also provide better detection performance for steganalysis. First, the general framework about utilizing Genetic Algorithm (GA) to do feature selection for steganalysis is presented. Then, we analyze similarity among individuals (SI) in each generation and the Transformation of Generations (TG) to determine whether the GA has converged into a local area. Next, according to the SI and TG, the restarting operation is incorporated into the HGA to allow the algorithm to escape from the unsatisfactory local area. In the experiments, three feature subsets are formed from a universal feature set for three typical steganography methods, respectively. The experimental results show that the classifiers using the feature subsets gain better detection accuracy and higher speed than those using the universal set. © 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Feature selection; Information security; Local convergence; Similarity among individuals; Transformation of generations","Cryptography; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Feature selection; Information security; Local convergence; Similarity among individuals; Transformation of generations; Set theory"

This makes them vulnerable to subtractive attacks, because the attacker can remove the dummy data structures without altering the functionality or the semantic of the software program. We argue that hiding watermarks in one or more data structures that are used by the program would make the watermark more robust because disturbing the watermark would affect the semantic and the functionality of the underlying software. The challenge is that the insertion of the watermark should have a minimal effect on the operations and performance of the data structure. This paper proposes a novel method for watermarking R-tree data structure and its variants. The proposed watermarking technique does not change the values of the stored data objects. It takes advantage of the redundancy in the order of entries inside the R-tree nodes. Entries are arranged relative to a ""secret"" initial order, known only to the software owner, using a technique based on a numbering system that uses variable radix with factorial base. The addition of the watermark in the R-tree data structure does not affect the performance nor does it increase the size of the R-tree. The paper provides a detailed security analysis and performance evaluation to show that the embedded watermarks are robust and can withstand various types of attacks. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is as a consequence of such attributes, acquired within the organization, that employers can pose a major threat. Hence, employees use skills gained through their legitimate work duties for illegitimate gain. A knowledge of security vulnerabilities can be exploited, utilising resources and access are provided by companies. It may even be the case that the motive is created by the organization in the form of employee disgruntlement. These criminal attributes aid offenders in the pursuit of their criminal acts, which in the extreme can bring down an organization. In the main, companies have addressed the insider threat through a workforce, which is made aware of its information security responsibilities and acts accordingly. Thus, security policies and complementary education and awareness programmes are now commonplace for organizations. That said, little progress has been made in understanding the insider threat from an offender's perspective. As organizations attempt to grapple with the behavior of dishonest employees, criminology potentially offers a body of knowledge for addressing this problem. It is suggested that Situational Crime Prevention (SCP), a relative newcomer to criminology, can help enhance initiatives aimed at addressing the insider threat. In this article, we discuss how recent criminological developments that focus on the criminal act, represent a departure from traditional criminology, which examines the causes of criminality. As part of these recent developments we discuss SCP. After defining this approach, we illustrate how it can inform and enhance information security practices. In recent years, a number of criminologists have criticised their discipline for assuming that the task of explaining the causes of criminality is the same as explaining the criminal act. Simply to explain how people develop a criminal disposition is only half the equation. What is also required is an explanation of how crimes are perpetrated. Criminological approaches, which focus on the criminal act, would appear to offer more to information security practitioners than their dispositional counterparts. Accordingly, the SCP approach can offer additional tools for practitioners in their fight against insider computer crime. © 2009 ACM.","","Computer crime; Law enforcement; Personal computing; Personnel; Security systems; Social sciences; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Awareness programmes; Body of knowledge; Computer fraud; Crime Prevention; Criminal acts; Global Security; Information security; Information security practice; Insider Threat; Mass media; Security policy; Security Survey; Security vulnerabilities; Security of data"

It is the art of hiding the fact that communication is takes place, by hiding information in other information. Many different file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the Internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exist a large variety of steganographic techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Many applications have different requirements of the steganography technique used. Some applications may use absolute invisibility of the secret information, but others require a larger secret message to be hidden.

This paper documents a study of twenty enterprises, six of them in the critical infrastructure (CI) domain. The state of security in the CI enterprises differed little from that in the other enterprises. Information security was seen as a technical problem with technical solutions. However, vulnerabilities in processes and human fallibility create a need for formal and informal controls in addition to technical controls. These three controls are interdependent. They vary widely in implementation time and resource needs, which render the task of building security resources a challenging problem. This paper presents a system dynamics model that illustrates how security controls are interconnected and are interdependent at a high level. The model is intended to aid security managers in CI domains to better understand information security management strategies, especially the complexities involved in managing a socio-technical system where human, organizational and technical factors interact. The model also demonstrates how the knowledge gained from proactive security activities can help managers improve the effectiveness of security controls, risk assessments and incident detection capabilities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Since biometrics is concerned with the measurements of unique human physiological or behavioural characteristics, the technology has been used to verify the identity of computer or network users. Given today's heightened security requirements of military as well as other applications such as banking, health care, etc., it is becoming critical to be able to monitor the presence of the authenticated user throughout a session. This paper presents a prototype system that uses facial recognition technology to monitor the authenticated user. The objective is to ensure that the user who is using the computer is the same person that logged onto the system. A neural network-based algorithm is implemented to carry out face detection, and an eigenface method is employed to perform facial recognition. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed which allows the performance of face detection and facial recognition to be monitored at run time. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of near-real-time continuous user verification for high-level security information systems. © 2009 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Biometrics; Buffer storage; Computer networks; Continuous time systems; Electronic document identification systems; Graphical user interfaces; Health care; Military applications; Real time systems; Digital credentials; Eigenface method; Face Detection; Facial recognition; Information security; Monitoring system; Near-real time; Network-based algorithm; OR-networks; Other applications; Prototype system; Runtime; Security requirements; User verification; Face recognition"

In this paper, we propose a new digital image encryption algorithm that employs a hyper-chaotic cellular neural network. To substantiate its security characteristics, we conduct the following security analyses of the proposed algorithm: key space analysis, sensitivity analysis, information entropy analysis and correlation coefficients analysis of adjacent pixels. The results demonstrate that the proposed encryption algorithm has desirable security properties and can be deployed as a cornerstone in a sound security cryptosystem. The comparison of the proposed algorithm with five other chaos-based image encryption algorithms indicates that our algorithm has a better security performance.","Cellular neural network; Chaotic systems; Image encryption; Security","Algorithms; Cellular neural networks; Chaotic systems; Computer supported cooperative work; Network security; Sensitivity analysis; Adjacent pixels; Chaotic cellular neural network; Chaotic characteristics; Chaotic map; Cognitive informatics; Correlation coefficient; Cryptosystem; Cryptosystems; Digital image encryption; Encryption algorithms; Engineering applications; Image encryption; Image encryption algorithm; Information assurance; Information entropy; Key space; Keystream; Neural network method; Potential risks; Return map; Security; Security analysis; Security properties; Cryptography"

Malicious attackers break into hosts using a variety of techniques. The most common method is to exploit known vulnerabilities. Although patches have long been available for vulnerabilities, system administrators have enerally been reluctant to patch their hosts immediately because they perceive the patches to be annoying and complex. To solve these problems, we propose a security vulnerability evaluation and patch framework called PKG-VUL, which evaluates the software installed on hosts to decide whether the hosts are vulnerable and then applies patches to vulnerable hosts. All these operations are accomplished by the widely used simple network management protocol (SNMP). Therefore, system administrators can easily manage their vulnerable hosts through PKG-VUL included in the SNMP-based network management systems as a module. The evaluation results demonstrate the applicability of PKG-VUL and its performance in terms of devised criteria.","Patch; PKG-MIB; PKG-VLU; Security vulnerability evaluation; SNMP; Ubuntu","Internet protocols; Network management; Network protocols; Patch; PKG-MIB; PKG-VLU; Security vulnerability evaluation; SNMP; Ubuntu; Security of data"

In these foundries, sophisticated attackers are able to insert malicious Trojan circuits that are easily hidden in the large, complex circuitry that comprises modern ICs. These so-called Trojan circuits are capable of launching attacks directly in hardware, or, more deviously, can facilitate software attacks. Current defense against Trojan circuits consists of statistical detection techniques to find such circuits before product deployment. The fact that statistical detection can result in false negatives raises the obvious questions: can attacks be detected post-deployment, and is secure execution nonetheless possible using chips with undetected Trojan circuits? In this paper we present the Secure Heartbeat And Dual-Encryption (SHADE) architecture, a compiler-hardware solution for detecting and preventing a subset of Trojan circuit attacks in deployed systems. Two layers of hardware encryption are combined with a heartbeat of off-chip accesses to provide a secure execution environment using untrusted hardware. The SHADE system is designed to complement pre-deployment detection techniques and to add a final, last-chance layer of security. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - The research model was tested with data obtained through online survey questionnaires. A pre- and a pilot-test of the survey instrument are conducted. Then, a final five-point Likert scale instrument is created. The solicitation for participants is done through e-mail invitations. Survey results are analyzed using factor analysis and logistic regression. Findings - The results do not find statistically significant relationships for hypotheses related to perceived vulnerability and response cost with the dependent variable. Perceived severity, self-efficacy, and response efficacy are significantly related to use of anti-spyware tools. Research limitations/implications - The empirical findings suggest that protection motivation theory (PMT) may possibly provide a new avenue in the domain of IS adoption. In addition to the usefulness and ease of use in the classical IT adoption models, the threat appeal factors are added in this study to provide a different perspective in understanding technology adoption behavior. Practical implications - The findings provide insights for business managers and information security professionals attempting to deliver to and implement security mechanisms like anti-spyware among end-users who are faced with security threats. Originality/value - While theories such as technology acceptance model, theory of planned behavior and theory of reasoned action are insufficient to gauge consumers' attitude and behavioral change toward the adoption of anti-spyware tools when consumers are confronted with threats, this paper provides theoretical support and contributions to the research based on applying PMT in the arena of information systems. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer software; Consumer behaviour; Data security; Motivation (psychology)","Behavioral research; Computer software; Motivation; Online systems; Security of data; Security systems; Surveys; Word processing; Anti-spywares; Behavioral changes; Business managers; Consumer behaviour; Data security; Dependent variables; Design/methodology/approach; Ease of use; Empirical findings; Empirical investigation; End-users; Factor analysis; Information security professionals; IS adoption; IT adoption; Logistic regressions; Motivation (psychology); Online surveys; Protection motivation theory; Research models; Security mechanism; Security threats; Self efficacy; Spy-ware; Survey instruments; Technology acceptance model; Technology adoption; Theory of Planned Behavior; Theory of reasoned action; Mathematical models"

These three controls are not independent, rather they are interdependent. They vary widely in implementation times and resource needs, making building security resources a challenging problem.

Considering actual web-based EHR systems, patient-centric and patient moderated approaches are widely deployed. Besides these initiatives there is an emerging market of so called personal health record platforms, e.g. Google Health. Both concepts provide a central and web-based access to highly sensitive data of EHRs. Additionally, the fact that these EHR systems may be hosted by not fully trustworthy providers necessitates to thoroughly consider privacy issues. In this paper we define security and privacy objectives that play an important role in context of web-based EHRs. Furthermore, we discuss deployed solutions as we as concepts proposed in the literature with respect to this objectives and point out several weaknesses.

Findings - Ten trends are identified consisting of aspects of: the difficulty of hiring qualified labor in-country; establishment of strategy resides entirely within the IT management; security remains a serious concern; offshore subcontractors sometimes place their employees within Icelandic companies; mid- and upper-level employees who can strategically develop networks and systems are in strong demand; use of information system (IS)/IT standards for information security is mostly voluntary; generally, the establishment of IS/IT strategy does not remain with board of directors; virtually all Icelandic corporations engage in, or have engaged in, outsourcing over the past five years (11 sub-trends are identified); and the business school curricula is inadequate to the needs of Icelandic corporations with respect to IT demands. Research limitations/implications - Comparisons among Nordic and other small nations are not addressed. Virtually, every trend noted should be followed up with additional study. This paper is designed to establish baseline of current offspring activity in Iceland. It is by no means a definitive study. Practical implications - Many research threads are identified and opened for future work. Academic programs can use this paper as motivation for modifications in existing programs and the creation of new one that better satisfies corporate needs. Originality/value - Prior to this paper, there is no information available on the state of IT offshoring in the country of Iceland. A benchmark is now established against which future research can be measured. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication technologies; Iceland; Outsourcing",""

Then, several important issues regarding TPM's applications for cryptography are addressed and analyzed through engineering empirical study. Two key problems, namely, the stability of weight synchronization and the security of synchronization, are investigated in detail. Two new concept methods, the threshold in neuron activation function and hash-based synchronization check, are proposed to improve the TPM-based cryptography application scheme. ANOVA and statistical experiments results show that using threshold can achieve faster and more stable weight synchronization, while using hash function can check weight synchronization precisely. Finally, attack analysis for the improved TPM-used protocol models is discussed.","Cryptographic protocol; Key agreement; Neural network; Tree parity machine; Weight synchronization","Hash functions; Network security; Neural networks; Research; Synchronization; Thermoelectric power; Application scheme; Attack analysis; Cryptographic protocol; Cryptographic protocols; Empirical studies; Information security; Interacting neural network; Key agreement; Key problems; Neural Cryptography; Neural-network; Neuron activation function; New concept; Protocol model; Stable weight; Statistical experiments; Theoretical research; Tree parity machine; Weight synchronization; Network protocols"

Through this process, we also demonstrate that confusion matrix has all the properties of a random walk. In effect, this ensures the property of ergodicity which states that almost every initial point will move to almost any position in the state space with equal probability as the system evolves in time. Random walk thus generated using chaos theory ensures the unpredictability.

Extensive computational experience with such a model suggests that a Nash-equilibrium design exists that can withstand the worst possible damage.

Design-methodology-approach Some 62 cases of intentional information security breaches by insiders are examined using canonical analysis. Findings The results indicate that a significant relationship exists between financial hardship, relationship strains, and the theft and sale of proprietary data by insiders; and recent firings, substance abuse, and relationship strains are related to information system sabotage.

To simplify the research problem, we assume that the information warfare (IW) is conducted in an isolated paradigm, which we call an electronic cosmos (ecosmos), i.e., independent of other national and/or war strategies, which is not realistic but allows us to develop a manageable mathematical architecture for modeling and simulation. In this architecture issues outside the cosmos, such as other national or war strategies, are abstracted and represented with the vectors of environmental covariates. This architecture integrates four closely related fields: reliability analysis, survivability analysis, dynamic hybrid fault models, and agent-based computing under a unified architecture. Analogically, it draws on biological inspiration from the studies on metapopulation dynamics, animal communication networks and conflict resolution, social learning and social foraging in behavioral and cognitive ecology. Mathematically, the architecture consists of three layers and is formulated around the core concept of dynamic hybrid fault models-the notion of ""Byzantine generals playing the evolutionary game."" The three-layer architecture includes a set of definitions, models and approaches: The tactical level deals with unpredictable, latent, unobserved or unobservable risks (UUUR) by utilizing survival analysis and its sister technologies. The strategic level integrates dynamic hybrid fault models (Ma & Krings 2008, Ma 2008) and tactical level models. From the strategic level, the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) prescribes the sustainable or survivable strategies. In the third level-operational level-a duo of survivability metrics, action threshold survivability (TS) and the expected survivability (ES), are defined to help implement the survivable strategies. This new approach requires neither the knowledge of the probabilities of UUUR events nor the assignment of subjective probabilities. In addition, we subscribe to Deibel's (2007) concept of hierarchical strategies and consider IW strategy as simply a layer in a multi-layer structure of the national strategy.

Reducing their considerable costs has become a pressing issue. Although cybersecurity has strong public good characteristics, most information security decisions are made by individual stakeholders. Due to the interconnectedness of cyberspace, these decentralized decisions are afflicted with externalities that can result in sub-optimal security levels. Devising effective solutions to this problem is complicated by the global nature of cyberspace, the interdependence of stakeholders, as well as the diversity and heterogeneity of players. The paper develops a framework for studying the co-evolution of the markets for cybercrime and cybersecurity. It examines the incentives of stakeholders to provide for security and their implications for the ICT ecosystem. The findings show that market and non-market relations in the information infrastructure generate many security-enhancing incentives.

The multi-layered architecture supports multiple levels of fault detection, masking, and dynamic load balancing. Unlike traditional fault-tolerant architectures that treat service requirements uniformly, each layer of the assured architecture implements a different level of services and information assurances. The system achieves load balancing by moving between layers of different complexity. Functionalities at different layers range from essential services necessary to satisfy the most stringent requirements for information assurance and system survivability at the lowest layer, to increasingly sophisticated functionalities with extended capabilities and complexity at higher layers. Low-layer functionalities can be used to monitor the behavior of high-layer functionalities. At each layer of the assured architecture, N-variant implementations make efficient use of multi-core hardware. The degree of the introduced redundancy in each layer determines the mix of faults that can be tolerated. The use of hybrid fault models allows us to consider fault types ranging from benign faults to Byzantine faults. Our framework extends recent work in N-variant systems for intrusion detection, which are demonstrated to be special cases. Further-more, it allows the movement in a tradeoff space between (1) the levels of assurance provided at different layers, (2) the levels of redundancy used at specific layers, which determine the fault types that can be tolerated, and (3) the desired run-time overhead.

We considered two control variables, industry type and firm size, and their effects on e-SCM diffusion. We developed our measurement approach on the basis of existing theory. We gathered data using a structured questionnaire that was administered through e-mail. The findings that we obtained reveal that the attributes for technological and collaborative structures have different impacts on the three diffusion stages. Overall, technological structure is a more important indicator for the adoption stage, while collaborative structure is more important in the assimilation stage. This is because the focus of innovation diffusion at the earlier stages is on the improvement of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and information security. Innovation diffusion at the later stages mainly lies in building good cooperative relationships among trading partners to facilitate their transactions. Industry type and firm size are correlated to different degrees with the attributes of technological and collaborative structures, and with the different diffusion stages. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Risk management has always been an integral part of an Information Security programme. Hence, security should be addressed as one of the many key risk areas. Incorporation of information security within an It risk management programme elevates the importance of it and ties its practice together with other key IT risks. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires a formal risk assessment to evaluate the factors that impact an organization's performance, because IT risk management and information security's role is critical. The performance of risk assessments are a key component of good information security, mainly risk identification. In addition to return-on security-Investment strategy, the other trend is developing a culture of shared accountability. The reason being- the security is supposed to educate the business leader about threats, costs and consequences on the organization and the effectiveness of the possible remedies.

The process of identifying, justifying, implementing and maintaining the correct balance between security and ease of access for authorized users requires careful consideration at a number of phases, including the assessment of risks, the identification of appropriate standards, the definition of policies and the education of users, and organizations also need to implement mechanisms for the regular and effective review and update of the measures taken.

Design/methodology/approach - An online survey is conducted to validate the proposed research model. The survey is sent out to an industrial panel. A total of 176 usable responses are received and used in the data analysis. Findings - The results show that both perceived behavioral control (PBC) and attitude have significant impact on intention to comply with security policy. Perceived technical protection affects behavioral intentions both indirectly, through PBC, and directly. The negative direct effect (i.e. perceived high technical protection leads to low intention to comply with security policy) suggests possible risk compensation effects in the information security context. Practical implications - This result should be of interest to practitioners. In practice (e.g. during security training), the power and capability of technical protection mechanisms should not be exaggerated. Instead, its limitations and drawbacks should be emphasized, so that end-users will adopt more cautious security practices and adhere to the requirements of the organization's security policies.

Design/methodology/approach - Policy analysis methods from social research are used. Professional information security education (and certification) is generally provided by commercial training arms of major IT vendors, independent industry groups and universities. While the ""for profit"" status of commercial training organisations is recognised, the commercial standing of universities is unclear, since they increasingly charge commercial-grade (or higher) fees for professional development, especially at the postgraduate level. The independence from commercial interests is one of the main attractions for students to undertake professional education at universities; however, if universities are becoming commercial, at what point and according to which criteria is the veracity of vendor-supplied training and university education considered equal, or indeed, superior? Findings - This paper briefly reviews the key drivers of university commercialisation, and discusses the implications for postgraduate education in the very sensitive area of information security, in an Australian context, especially where universities directly compete with private sector interests. The key findings are that universities who wish to offer information security programs in competition with private providers will need to adopt corporate-style governance policies and procedures, which include industry representation on boards, and ensuring that academic independence is not compromised by deeper vendor relationships. Originality/value - No other papers have specifically investigated the emerging trends in information security education, in an Australian context, and related these to the necessary changes in governance that will be required for universities to compete on equal terms with corporate providers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Governance; Professional education; Qualifications",""

However, the outcomes should also be measured to see how successful and effective this training has been for the employees. In this study, an information security awareness project is implemented in a company both by training and by subsequent auditing of the effectiveness and success of this training (which focussed on password usage, password quality and compliance of employees with the password policies of the company). The project was conducted in a Turkish company with 2900 white-collar employees. Each employee took information security training including password usage. Also, there were several supporting awareness campaigns such as educational posters, animations and e-messages on the company Intranet, surveys and simple online quizzes. The project was carried out over a 12 month period and three password security strength audits were made during this period. The results were comparatively and statistically analysed.

It is recognised that insiders pose security risks due to their legitimate access to facilities and information, knowledge of the organisation and the location of valuable assets. Insiders will know how to achieve the greatest impact whilst leaving little evidence. However, organisations may not have employed effective risk management regimes to deal with the speed and scale of change, for example the rise of outsourcing. Outsourcing can lead to the fragmentation of protection barriers and controls and increase the number of people treated as full time employees. Regional and cultural differences will manifest themselves in differing security threat and risk profiles. At the same time, the recession is causing significant individual (and organisational) uncertainty and may prompt an increase in abnormal behaviour in long-term employees and managers - those traditionally most trusted - including members of the security community. In this environment, how can organisations know who to trust and how to maintain this trust? The paper describes a practitioner's view of the issue and the approaches used by BT to assess and address insider threats and risks. Proactive measures need to be taken to mitigate against insider attacks rather than reactive measures after the event. A key priority is to include a focus on insiders within security risk assessments and compliance regimes. The application of technology alone will not provide solutions. Security controls need to be workable in a variety of environments and designed, implemented and maintained with people's behaviour in mind. Solutions need to be agile and build and maintain trust and secure relationships over time. This requires a focus on human factors, education and awareness and greater attention on the security 'aftercare' of employees and third parties. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The security weakness is rooted in the server-less architecture and the demand driven adhoc operation scenarios of peer-to-peer systems. Together, they prohibit scalable key management using traditional symmetric/asymmetric cryptographic techniques. The advent of hierarchical identity-based cryptography and thresholded/joint secret sharing offers a possible solution to this problem. In this paper, we present the design of Halo, a hierarchical identity-based public key infrastructure that uses these novel technologies to perform recursive instantiation of private key generators and establish a trust hierarchy with unlimited number of levels. The PKI thus enables the employment of hierarchical identity-based public key encryption, signature, and signcryption for the protection of peer-to-peer applications.

Furthermore, previous studies showed that the choice of network features used for the IDS is dependent on the type of the attack. Accordingly, each TCP/IP network layer has specific type of network attacks, which means that each TCP/IP network layer needs a specific type of IDS. This paper proposes a new categorization for IDS depending on the TCP/IP network model: Application layer IDS (AIDS), Transport layer IDS (TIDS), Network layer IDS (NIDS) and Link layer IDS (LIDS). Each of these IDS types is specialized to a specific network device. So, the detection process will be distributed among all TCP/IP network model layers through the network devices. To design each of these different types of IDS, several experiments have been conducted using two different features selection approaches to select the appropriate features set for each IDS type. The experimental results indicate that each IDS type has different features set that can not only improve the overall performance of the IDS, but it also can improve its scalability. © 2009 IEEE.","Features ranking; Features selection; Intrusion detection systems; Support vector decision function; Support vector machines; TCP/IP network model","Computer crime; Image retrieval; Internet protocols; Network layers; Personal computing; Support vector machines; Technical presentations; Vectors; Features ranking; Features selection; Intrusion detection systems; Support vector decision function; TCP/IP network model; Intrusion detection"

Foremost is the issue of theft: more expensive and technologically advanced devices are more likely to be stolen, smaller devices are more likely to be lost - and yet paradoxically both classes lead to greater adoption, and thus greater trust by users. Biometric information has long been promoted as a solution to many of the authentication and security needs in module consumer devices, and yet biometric sensors increase cost, size, weight, consume battery power and can reduce ease of use. Keypress biometrics, which includes typing biometrics, a technique that has seen much research but little adoption over the past decade, is ideally suited to mobile consumer devices such as mobile telephones due to its potential low implementation overheads. This paper considers keypress biometrics for such cases and presents a low-complexity statistical approach to the implementation of the method within an embedded system. ©2009 IEEE.","Biometrics; Consumer electronic devices; Embedded systems; User interface","Biometrics; Electron devices; Embedded systems; Thermoelectric equipment; User interfaces; Battery power; Biometric informations; Biometric sensors; Consumer devices; Consumer electronic devices; Ease of use; Information security; Low-complexity; Mobile consumer devices; Mobile telephones; Statistical approach; Typing biometrics; Consumer electronics"

From information involving the highest level of government administration and national security, to information existing at the level of the private company in the form of trade secrets or personal data, all are under the constant threat of being compromised. In this study, the researchers attempt to evaluate the information security maturity level and provide clear thoughtful analysis of the information security landscapes of the Malaysian Public Service (MPS) organizations. This study uses convenience sampling and the required data collected from 970 targeted individuals through a self-administrated survey. In addition, a survey questionnaire is utilized to gauge the security landscape and to further understand the occurrence of incidents, the sources of attack, and the types of technical safeguard. Findings revealed that the highest security incidents experienced by the MPS were spamming (42%), followed by attacks of malicious codes (41%). Twenty-five percent of incidents originated from within the organizations, 15% originated from outside, and 11% were from a mixture of internal and external sources. Also, it shows that 49% of incidents were from sources unknown to the respondents. The top most deployed safeguards by the MPS were found to be firewalls (95%), followed by anti-virus software (92%), and access control to information system (89%). Findings on the maturity level show that 61% of respondents are at Level 3, followed by 21% at Level 2 where the information security processes are still considered an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) domain.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid method for the detection of polymorphic worms. It uses improved Reverse Sequential Hypothesis Testing (RSHT) to detect portscans which are routinely used to find vulnerable hosts to compromise. Then a CPU emulator is used to execute every possible instruction sequence in suspicious traffic and determine whether it is an exploit code. We implemented a prototype and tested it using real polymorphic worms.

Secondly, security domain, protection factor, sensitive factor and safety factor are introduced on the basis of structural integrity, and the assessment model of the validity of security policy is also built. The relationship of defense means, application targets, and information security attribute characteristics is analyzed, the protection factor and sensitivity factor are established, and then the value of security policy safety factor is obtained in order to assess the validity of security policy. Lastly, the consistency detection algorithm is put forward according to the relationship of these features by introducing the associated logo set.

The suicide attacks on US twin towers 11 Sept. 2001, Train bombings in Madrid Spain 11 Mar. 2004, London bombings 7 Jul. 2005 and Mumbai attack 26 Nov. 2008 were some of the most disturbing, destructive and evil acts by terrorists in the last decade which has clearly shown their evil intent that they can go to any extent to accomplish their goals. Many terrorist organizations such as al Quaida, Harakat ul-Mujahidin, Hezbollah, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Toiba, etc. are carrying out training camps and terrorist operations which are accompanied with latest technology and high tech arsenal. To counter such terrorism our military is in need of advanced defense technology. One of the major issues of concern is secure communication. It has to be made sure that communication between different military forces is secure so that critical information is not leaked to the adversary. Military forces need secure communication to shield their confidential data from terrorist forces. Leakage of concerned data can prove hazardous, thus preservation and security is of prime importance. There may be a need to perform computations that require data from many military forces, but in some cases the associated forces would not want to reveal their data to other forces. In such situations Secure Multi-party Computations find their application. In this paper, we propose a new highly scalable Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) protocol and algorithm for Defense applications which can be used to perform computation on encrypted data. Every party encrypts their data in accordance with a particular scheme. This encrypted data is distributed among some created virtual parties. These Virtual parties send their data to the TTP through an Anonymizer layer. TTP performs computation on encrypted data and announces the result. As the data sent was encrypted its actual value can't be known by TTP and with the use of Anonymizers we have covered the identity of true source of data. Modifier tokens are generated along encryption of data which are distributed among virtual parties, then sent to TTP and finally used in the computation. Thus without revealing the data, right result can be computed and privacy of the parties is maintained. We have also given a probabilistic security analysis of hacking the protocol and shown how zero hacking security can be achieved. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Defense; Information Security; Privacy; Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC)","Bombing; Computer crime; Cryptography; Military applications; Network protocols; Personal computing; Terrorism; Anonymizer; Confidential data; Critical information; Defense; Defense technologies; Encrypted data; High tech; Information Security; Latest technology; Military force; Privacy; Secure communications; Secure multi-party computation; Security analysis; Suicide attacks; Terrorist operations; Terrorist organization; Training camps; Twin towers; Network security"

In order to develop secure DWs we have proposed a Model Driven Architecture (MDA) composed of several secure metamodels at different abstraction levels and transformations between them. Lately, a specialization of this architecture considering a multidimensional approach towards On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools has been defined, but the support to automatically transform complex security rules has not been dealt with so far.

Through the years, different generic data encryption standards have been developed. Although these encryption standards provide a high level of data protection, they are not efficient in the encryption of multimedia contents due to the large volume of digital image/video data. In order to address this issue, different image/video encryption methodologies have been developed. These methodologies encrypt only the key parameters of image/video data instead of encrypting the entire bit stream. In addition, researchers start to utilize information hiding techniques to augment the security level of data encryption methodologies.

There have been many incidents of trust account fraud reported internationally, including a case in Australia, where a employee of a law firm stole $4,500,000 from the trust funds of forty-two clients. Trust account fraud is also widely associated with money laundering, a growing major crime involving financial transactions that enable unlawful activity to be disguised. Our study involved interviewing principles of ten law companies to find out solicitors' attitudes to computer security and the possibility of breaches of their trust accounts. We simultaneously carried out a survey to see if the trends identified in our case studies could be backed up with broader quantitative data. An overall finding highlights the fact that law firms were not current with technology to combat computer crime. However, from a human perspective, more urgent issues were discovered such as lack of monitoring of computer systems and inadequate access control.

In the measures as securing digital information, there are cryptosystems that protect secrecy of digital documents and digital signature scheme that ensure validity of digital documents. In the case of reality, i.e. hardware devices are used in cryptosystems, there is a possibility that secret information leaks via sidechannel. Simple Power Analysis (SPA) attacks are one of the side-channel attacks. To prevent a SPA, one of the sidechannel attacks, the Montgomery Powering Ladder (MPL) method has been considered as one of the countermeasures. In this paper, we show that a naïve implementation of the MPL method is vulnerable for SPA attacks by observing the power consumption of the controller block of the RSA hardware. Furthermore, in order to avoid such information leakage, we propose a new hardware architecture for RSA using the MPL method to enhance SPA resistance. © 2009 IEEE.","","Cryptography; Cryptosystems; Digital Documents; Digital information; Digital signature schemes; Hardware architecture; Hardware devices; Information leakage; Information security; Internet system; Montgomery; New approaches; Power Consumption; Secret information; Side channel attack; Side-channel; Simple power analysis; Electronic document identification systems"

Design/methodology/approach – Vulnerabilities in information security are compared to the concept of “monster” introduced by Martijntje Smits in philosophy of technology. The applicability of different strategies for dealing with monsters to information security is discussed, and the strategies are linked to attitudes in virtue ethics. Findings – It is concluded that the present approach can form the basis for dealing proactively with unknown future vulnerabilities in information security. Research limitations/implications – The research presented here does not define a stepwise approach for implementation of the recommended strategy in practice. This is future work. Practical implications – The results of this paper enable computer experts to rethink their attitude towards security threats, thereby reshaping their practices.

Lately some researchers have informally stated that hybrid role development is the most promising way to define roles, however, there hasn't been given a well-defined justification for this decision. The main contribution of this paper is hence the deduction of evaluation criteria based on information gathered from literature, practical experiences, and shortcomings of existing role development approaches.

As the concerned data is property of the organization or the party, preservation and security of this data is of prime importance for such type of computations. Although the computation requires data from all the parties, but none of the associated parties would want to reveal their data to the other parties. We have proposed a new protocol to perform computation on encrypted data. The data is encrypted in a manner that it does not affect the result of the computation. It uses modifier tokens which are distributed among virtual parties, and finally used in the computation. The computation function uses the acquired data and modifier tokens to compute right result from the encrypted data. Thus without revealing the data, right result can be computed and privacy of the parties is maintained. We have given a probabilistic security analysis and have also shown how we can achieve zero hacking security with proper configuration. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Information Security; Privacy; Protocol; Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC)","Computer crime; Cryptography; Network protocols; Personal computing; Computation function; Confidential data; Encrypted data; Information Security; New protocol; Privacy; Protocol; Secure multi-party computation; Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC); Security analysis; Network security"

This N-PFRFT is an extension of four-item weighted fractional Fourier transform (N-PFRFT) defined by Shih[1] and it owns four free parameters in the weight coefficients besides the order of the fractional Fourier transform. A novel image encryption algorithm is presented by the N-PFRFT.The method owns more secret keys than the encryption methods operated by other fractional Fourier transforms without any increase of the computational complexity. On the other hand, the image still can't be decrypted correctly even though the order of FRFT which is treated as a secret key is known. So do the four free parameters. Therefore, both the order parameter and the vector parameter can be chosen in the real domain to improve the security of the encryption method.

Unfortunately, construction of CL-PKC and AK protocols has so far depended on the use of identitybased encryption, which results in the bilinear pairing-based schemes that need costly operations. We present a secure certificateless authenticated key agreement protocol without paring, based on the certificateless encryption scheme proposed by J. Baek et al. It shows that the newly proposed scheme is of nice efficiency and practical. Moreover, it provides perfect forward secrecy, PKG forward secrecy and almost all the other known security attributes, such as knownkey secrecy, key-compromise impersonation resilience, unknown key-share resilience, known session-specific temporary information security, message independence and no key control. © 2009 IEEE.","Authenticated key agreement; Certificateless-based cryptography; Perfect forward secrecy; PKG forward secrecy","Computer privacy; Computer science; Information technology; Network protocols; Network security; Authenticated key agreement; Authenticated key agreement protocols; Bilinear pairing; Certificateless; Certificateless public key cryptography; Certificateless-based cryptography; Data confidentiality; Encryption schemes; Forward secrecy; Identity Based Encryption; Identity-based; Information security; Key control; Key-compromise impersonation; Perfect forward secrecy; PKG forward secrecy; Public networks; Security attributes; Unknown key-share; Public key cryptography"

Most of the proposed methods provide keys based on chaotic cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, an image encryption scheme based on a chaotic True Random Bit Generator (TRBG) is proposed.The chaotic generator is a nonlinear electronic circuit which produces double scroll chaotic attractors. The values of the circuit parameters and the initial conditions are the keys of the cryptographic scheme. Since the dynamic behavior of the circuit is so unpredictable, a true random bits sequence is produced via a well known method. We adopt the FIPS 1401 statistical suite to test the distribution of the bits sequence. This sequence is used to encrypt and decrypt images. Also, the security analysis of the encrypted image demonstrates the high security of the proposed scheme. © 2009 IEEE.","Chaotic cryptography; Double scroll circuit; Image encryption","Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Electron tubes; Keys (for locks); Network security; Number theory; Signal processing; Chaotic attractors; Chaotic cryptography; Chaotic generators; Circuit parameter; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic schemes; Double scroll circuit; Dynamic behaviors; Image encryption; Image encryption scheme; Image encryptions; Information security; Initial conditions; Nonlinear electronic circuits; Random bit generators; Random bits; Security analysis; Strong keys; Cryptography"

The length of Variable-length sliding window is changed as the specific division of elements in the window, so a method of combining NAF and variable-length sliding window is used to scale down the number of computations of point addition in the fast scalar multiplication of ECC.

We suggest the use of both symmetric and asymmetric approach for the encryption. The ciphertext of any document is generated by symmetric cryptosystem; the symmetric key is then encrypted by asymmetric approach. Further, Reed and Solomon codes are used on the generated asymmetric key to provide some error tolerance while decryption.

Computer forensics is the analysis of data processing equipment such as a data carrier, a network etc. to determine whether that equipment has been used for illegal or unauthorised purposes. Establishing the chain of custody through appropriate policy frameworks can be used in order to assess the quality of the collected data. Policy for forensics may address the practices of forensics agents and labs in investigating cybercrime. This chapter concludes that full-scale harmonisation of policies on criminal law and legal processes is likely to only happen at regional level (e.g. the EU) rather than at a global scale. Along with the assumption that safe havens where criminals operate from are not likely to be suppressed any time soon, leads to the conclusion that cyber-crime is here to stay for the long run in spite of the good efforts made to trail digital suspects through digital forensics. © 2009, IGI Global.","",""

Information systems development methodology that considers security requirements in the early phases of systems development is essential for ISS. In the context of ISS, information security awareness (SA) can play a vital role in minimizing end-user related security faults and maximizing the efficiency of security techniques. This information security awareness should be present in the requirements gathering phase of the software development process so that analysts become more aware of security constraints and possible violations resulting into secure business processes. In this paper, we extend the work by D'Aubeterre et al. (2008b) to evaluate the utility of Secure Activity Resource Coordination artifacts in generating three levels of security awareness: perception, comprehension and prediction.

On the basis of the predictive coding, an algorithm using the prediction error to carry on the information hiding is proposed in this paper. In order to restrain the error diffusion which possibly appears during the anti-predictive coding in the information hiding process, an improved predictive coding algorithm is put forward. Through the experiments, the performances of the basic algorithm and improved algorithm are tested, resulting in the proof of the thread correctness. At the same time, the improved algorithm achieves the ultra large information capacity of 0.953 bits/Byte and the PSNR of 49.184dB so as to verify the validity of the improved algorithm. © 2009 IEEE.","Information hiding; Information hiding capacity; Predictive coding; Robustness; Stochastic permutation algorithm","Computer science; Information technology; Stochastic systems; Information hiding; Information hiding capacity; Predictive coding; Robustness; Stochastic permutation algorithm; Algorithms"

These activities encompass the definition of the context of analysis, assessment, treatment, acceptance, as well as the communication and the monitoring of information security risks. Organizations should implement RM in a consistent, systematic manner in order to achieve compliance with current laws, standards and regulations, and also meet mandatory requirements for the certification of an Information Security Management System. However, in the context of information security, no reference was found in literature for a model to assess the maturity level of an RM process.

Based on this extension, we propose a method of known-plaintext attack (KPA) on double random phase encoding in the fractional Fourier transform domain (DRPE-FRFT). With this attack, an opponent can access two encryption phase keys with the help of the phase retrieval algorithm in the FRFT domain, and meanwhile obtain the two FRFT order keys by using an exhaustive search. This indicates that the optical encryption scheme based on the DRPE-FRFT scheme is vulnerable to KPA due to the nature of the linearity of FRFT.

Tree reconfigurations are triggered when failures or security violations occur in the connectivity path between the peer nodes (e.g., increase in path delays, DOS attack on a node). Reconfigurations are also initiated when the application-level properties of information flows change (e.g., lower data accuracy for non-important contents). For Information Assurance settings, a tree structure elegantly supports the desired properties of separation and non-inference between the low-level network entities and the application entities. A connectivity management algorithm reconfigures a tree satisfying the desired topological properties (e.g., low geographic spread, low peer-to-peer distances). The algorithm provides redundancy in the connectivity paths along the temporal dimension (on top of a rich connectivity in the physical infrastructure - as in overlay networks). Application case studies of tree-structured connectivity with QoS and security goals are also described. ©2009 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Overlay networks; Topology; Application-oriented; Connectivity management; Data accuracy; DoS attacks; Information assurance; Information flows; Infrastructure networks; Path delay; Peer nodes; Peer to peer; Peer-to-peer connectivity; Peer-to-peer information; Re-configurable; Security goals; Security violations; Temporal dimensions; Topological properties; Tree structures; Distributed computer systems"

Human errors in hospitals and medical centers are closed related with mishandling of multimedia medical records. Cryptography and steganography can offer not only information security but also secure association of multimedia records. This paper presents a new lossless synthetic methodology that combines cryptography and steganography techniques for achieving information security via encryption and information association via hiding in images. The proposed synthetic methodology merges SCAN Encryption- Compression-Hiding, LSB (Least Significant Bit) Hiding and Regional Hiding with Segmentation methodologies into a single information hiding and encryption methodology. The SCAN schemes are based on a 2D spatial accessing technique that can generate a very large number of permutation scanning paths. The LSB Hiding is an information hiding algorithm which is based on hiding bits of one message image into n-least significant bits of a host image. Regional Hiding with segmentation is an information hiding algorithm that works by hiding pixels of one message image into the most corresponding segments of a host image. The selection of such a complex secure scheme is also driven by the need to offer a very high level security protection of private data at the time the number of undesirable attacks in the digital communication world increases exponentially. © 2009 IEEE.","","Digital communication systems; Digital signal processing; Digital signal processors; Errors; Hospitals; Multimedia systems; Network security; Signal processing; Digital communications; Host images; Human errors; Information hiding; Information security; Least significant bits; Lossless; Medical center; Medical record; Private data; Scanning path; Security protection; Steganography; Synthetic methodology; Cryptography"

PI infringement in the public and private sector is common. There were 182,666 cases of PI in 2,624 public organizations during the last three years. Online infringement cases have increased. PI leakage causes moral and economic damage and is an impediment to public confidence in public organizations seeking to manage e-government and maintain open and aboveboard administration. Thus, it is an important matter. Most cases of PI leakage result from unsatisfactory management of security, errors in home page design and insufficient system protection management. Protection management, such as encryption or management of access logs should be reinforced urgently. However, it is difficult to comprehend the scope of practical technology management satisfied legislation and regulations. Substantial protective countermeasures, such as access control, certification, log management and encryption need to be established. It is hard to deal with the massive leakage of PI and its security management. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the conditions for the technical protection measures during the processing phase of PI. In addition, we classified the standard control items of protective measures suited to public circumstances. Therefore, this study provides a standard and checklist by which staff in public organizations can protect PI via technical management activities appropriate to laws and ordinances. In addition, this can lead to more detailed and clearer instructions on how to carry out technical protection measures and to evaluate the current status. © 2009 KSII.","Information security management; Personal information protection; PET; PIA",""

Effectively identifying and authenticating these clients can not only prevent illegal accesses but also eliminate unnecessary redundancies of access control. However, existing security solutions have largely ignored the identification and authentication issues or separately consider them from access control mechanisms. As a result, these solutions either have incurred a high cost of access control or led to new insurmountable problems. In this paper, we discuss the important consideration in designing an appropriate authentication scheme for largescale storage systems. First, we discuss potential authentication techniques for large-scale storage systems. The looming crisis of PKI, a widely used technology for authentication in today's information security area is discussed and potential alternative technologies to PKI are suggested. Second, by merging authentication into access control we develop a decentralized security architecture for large-scale storage systems, designed to improve the scalability of authentication and reduce the overhead of access control. Finally, we experimentally evaluate how much overhead can be caused when various cryptographic algorithms used in an authentication protocol are applied to a large-scale storage system. © 2009 IEEE.","Access control; Authentication; Decentralized security; Large-scale storage","Cryptography; Identification (control systems); Security of data; Security systems; Access control mechanism; Alternative technologies; Authentication protocols; Authentication scheme; Authentication techniques; Cryptographic algorithms; Decentralized security; High costs; Illegal Access; Information security area; Large-scale storage; Security Architecture; Security solutions; Storage systems; Authentication"

Despite the fact that it is possible to bring about information security with the aid of a prevailing such as like cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the cryptographic keys is one of the major issues to be handled. It is possible to effectively solve the issue by combining biometrics and cryptography. Recently, the improved performance of cryptographic key produced from biometrics in terms of protection has acquired massive reputation amid the researchers and experimenters. Nevertheless, there is an enduring association amid the biometric and the user where in alteration is impracticable. Therefore, the biometric is vanished eternally and probably for all the applications that apply it, when a compromise of the biometric identifier is present. This might be resolved by building revocable biometric templates through cancelable biometrics. Here, we have projected an approach to produce irrevocable cryptographic key from cancelable fingerprint templates, a process which proposed algorithm carries out in an efficient manner. To begin with, the fingerprints are utilized to extract the minutiae points that are altered, in an efficient manner so as to acquire transformed points. Consequently, the transformed points are used to produce the cancelable templates which are in turn utilized for the extraction of irrevocable keys. It is extremely unfeasible to obtain cancelable fingerprint templates and original fingerprints from the generated key since the cryptographic key produced is irrevocable. The fingerprints accessible from open sources have been employed to assess the efficacy of our approach. © 2009 IEEE.","Biometric cryptosystems; Biometrics; Cancelable biometrics; Cryptography; Fingerprint; Irrevocable key; Key generation; Minutiae points","Algorithms; Computer science; Cryptography; Information technology; Security of data; Cancelable biometrics; Fingerprint; Irrevocable key; Key generation; Minutiae points; Biometrics"

The risk evaluation is a process of computing risk value by means of risk assessment, which is from assessment and evaluation of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities to the risk evaluation of information asset. Focused on the uncertainty and complexity of information, we integrate the artificial neural network to apply them in studying risk evaluation. Firstly, since the artificial neural network is suited for the quantity data processing, and poor to the qualitative analyze, and risk is uncertain , the risk factors are quantized by fuzzy evaluation method proposed in this dissertation so that the input of ANN are pre-treated. Secondly, wavelet analysis and the neural network is integrated, we apply them in studying risk evaluation. The shortcomings of the neural network can be overcome, such as a slower study velocity and lower fit accuracy. The simulation results show that risk level of the information system can be evaluated quantitatively by trained neural network, and the shortcomings of current evaluating methods can be overcome, such as more subjectivity and fuzzy conclusion. © 2009 IEEE.","Fuzzy-ANN; Information security; Risk evaluation; Wavelet neural network(WNN)","Backpropagation; Computer simulation; Control theory; Cybernetics; Data processing; Neural networks; Risk analysis; Risk management; Robot learning; Wavelet analysis; Artificial Neural Network; Assessment methods; Decision mechanism; Evaluating method; Fuzzy evaluation method; Fuzzy-ANN; Information assets; Information security; Information security systems; Risk evaluation; Risk factors; Risk levels; Risk value; Simulation result; Trained neural networks; Wavelet neural network(WNN); Risk assessment"

The adjective resilient has been in use for decades in the field of dependable computing systems however essentially as a synonym of fault-tolerant, thus generally ignoring the unexpected aspect of the phenomena the systems may have to face. These phenomena become of primary relevance when moving to systems like the future large, networked, evolving systems constituting complex information infrastructures - perhaps involving everything from super-computers and huge server ""farms"" to myriads of small mobile computers and tiny embedded devices, with humans being central part of the operation of such systems. Such systems are in fact the dawning of the ubiquitous systems that will support Ambient Intelligence. With such ubiquitous systems, what is at stake is to maintain dependability, i.e., the ability to deliver service that can justifiably be trusted, in spite of continuous changes. Therefore the term resilience and resilient computing can be applied to the design of ubiquitous systems and defined as the search for the following property: the persistence of service delivery that can justifiably be trusted, when facing changes. Changes may be of different nature, with different prospect and different timing. Therefore the design of ubiquitous systems requires the mastering of many, often separated, engineering disciplines that span from advanced probability to logic, from human factors to cryptology and information security and to management of large projects. From an educational point of view, very few, if any, Universities are offering a comprehensive and methodical track that is able to provide students with a sufficient preparation that makes them able to cope with the challenges posed by the design of ubiquitous systems. In Europe an activity has started towards the identification of a MSc curriculum in Resilient Computing as properly providing a timely and necessary answer to requirements posed by the design of ubiquitous systems. To this aim, a Network of Excellence ReSIST - Resilience for Survivability in IST - was run from January 2006 to March 2009 (see http://www.resist-noe.org/). In this presentation the results of ReSIST will be presented as well as the identified MSc curriculum in Resilient Computing, to share its experience and to involve a much larger, open and qualified community in the discussion of the proposed curriculum. © 2009 IEEE.","","Cryptography; Curricula; Design; Distributed parameter networks; Embedded systems; Probabilistic logics; Wireless networks; Ambient intelligence; Complex information; Cryptology; Dependable computing; Embedded device; Engineering disciplines; Environmental perturbations; Evolving systems; Fault-tolerant; Human factors; Information security; Large project; Mobile computers; Service delivery; Ubiquitous systems; Ubiquitous computing"

Common Criteria for IT security evaluation has long been considered to be victimized by uncertain IT infrastructure and considered resource hungry, complex and time consuming process. Considering this aspect we have continued our research quest for analyzing the opportunities to empower IT security evaluation process using Real Options thinking. The focus of our research is not only the applicability of real options analysis in IT security evaluation but also observing its implications in various domains including IT security investments and risk management. We find it motivating and worth doing to use an established method from corporate finance i.e. real options and utilize its rule of thumb technique as a road map to counter uncertainty issues for evaluation of IT products. We believe employing options theory in security evaluation will provide the intended benefits. i.e. i) manage dynamically changing security requirements ii) accelerating evaluation process iii) midcourse decision management. Having all the capabilities of effective uncertainty management, options theory follows work procedures based on mathematical calculations quite different from information security work processes. In this paper, we will address the diversities between the work processes of security evaluation and real options analysis. We present an adaptability infrastructure to bridge the gap and make them coherent with each other. This liaison will transform real options concepts into a compatible mode that provides grounds to target IT security evaluation and common criteria issues. We will address ESAM1 system as an example for illustrations and applicability of the concepts.

In this context, several alternatives have been proposed, mainly basing their security on the laws of physics. One of the most promising technologies is the optically generated chaos-based cryptography. One of its main advantages is that it can be combined with the technology of optical communication networks in a natural way.

This paper proposes a statistical design of experiments approach that will enhance the quantitative aspects of the risk assessment exercise and will make risk assessments smarter, more precise and more efficient.

A recent survey of 156 U.S. and Canadian law enforcement, forensic, and information assurance professionals discovered differences in the findings between the community examined in the earlier study and this one and suggest that there is merit in reopening the discussion between intrinsic and extrinsic motivators and the role they play in an organization. Examination of these two studies further suggests that the impact of motivators, both intrinsic and extrinsic, varies with the context of the knowledge management system to which they are applied.

This economic perspective assumes a ""rational actor"" whereas risk is subjectively perceived by people who may be influenced by a number of social, psychological, cultural, and other ""soft"" factors. Their decisions thus may deviate from what economic risk assessment analysis would dictate. In this respect, a phenomenon interesting to study is that on social network sites (SNSes) people tend to, despite a number of potential security risks, provide an amount of personal information that they would otherwise frown upon. In this study we explore how people's affect toward online social networking may impact their use of privacy safeguards. Since building social capital is a main purpose of online social networking, we use social capital theory to examine some potential contextual influence on the formation of the affect. More specifically, we adopt the perspective proposed by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), which views social capital as a composite of structural, relational, and cognitive capitals. Preliminary analysis of 271 survey responses shows that (a) a person's structural and relational embeddedness in her online social networks, as well as her cognitive ability in maintaining those networks, are positively related to her affect toward SNSes; (b) a person's affect toward SNSes moderates the relationship between her perception of privacy risk and the privacy safeguards she implements on the SNSes.","Affect; Information security; Privacy; Risk assessment; Security safeguards; Social capital; Social network sites","Data privacy; Information systems; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Security of data; Social networking (online); Affect; Cognitive ability; Economic perspective; Online social networks; Personal information; Preliminary analysis; Privacy risks; Relational embeddedness; Risk-benefit analysis; Security risks; Social capitals; Social context; Social Networks; Economic and social effects"

This paper contributes to the literature on information security by theorizing and empirically testing how the intent to comply with the Internet use policy is driven by a cost-benefit analysis bounded by personal moral norms and organization contextual factors. The results of this study indicate that employees' compliance intention of Internet use policy is the result of competing influences of perceived benefits of Internet abuses, formal sanction risks, personal moral norms and organizational facilitating conditions.

Mobile ticketing, a process that allows consumers to order, make payment, acquire, and authenticate tickets using their mobile phones, will become popular since it can be conducted from anywhere and at anytime. In addition to the convenience of use, the fabrication and distribution costs of traditional paper-tickets can be greatly reduced with mobile tickets. Many applications, such as traffic tickets, concert tickets, movie tickets, and so on, may take the advantages of mobile ticketing. Such tickets, in their paper-forms, can be transferred to anyone before use since no specific identity is recorded in these tickets. Nevertheless, current schemes restrict mobile tickets to be non-transferable because the transferring will result in the tickets being invalidated. To overcome the non-transferability problem, we use the idea of digital rights managements to separate the content and the usage-rules of mobile tickets, and propose a transferrable mobile ticketing scheme. The usage-rule, i.e. The rights object of the ticket, registers the ticket identification and a hashed number comprising an issuer's random number and the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) of the ticket owner. The rights object is independently issued by a trusted third party. When a ticket is transferred, the issuer will be notified and he will modify the rights object with a new hash value, computed from a new random number and the IMEI of the new owner who receives the transferred ticket. Therefore, mobile tickets are secured and transferrable in our proposed mobile ticketing scheme.","Digital rights management; Information security; Mobile commerce; Mobile ticket","Mobile commerce; Security of data; Current schemes; Daily lives; Digital Rights Management; Distribution costs; Hash value; Mobile equipments; Mobile ticket; Mobile ticketing; Non-transferability; Random Numbers; Trusted third parties; Copyrights"

XML was designed as an information mark-up language and was not designed with security in mind. Consequently we are left with the problem of security XML documents from attacks such as malicious modification or fabrication. With modern VPN technology such as SSL we can encrypt and secure a data stream as it cross the network. However, when the data stream encounters an organizational boundary such as a firewall the XML document has to be parsed and forwarded to any back-end systems that require it. Current IDS and Firewall Technology does not have the ability to identify when the contents of an XML document is being attacked. This paper outlines a firewall architecture for the secure exchange of information using the extensible mark up language (XML). The architecture can be used to create a virtual private network suitable for an e-commerce application, allowing secure communication over the Internet. This paper identifies the elements required to build an XML enabled firewall that will (1) ensure the secure communication of data, and (2) validate the data to ensure data integrity. The architecture addresses the issue of information integrity using the Document Type Definition and additional rules applied by a proxy.","Firewalls; Information security; Network security; Xml","Communication; Computer system firewalls; Data communication systems; Network architecture; Security of data; Virtual private networks; XML; Document type definition; E-Commerce applications; Exchange of information; Extensible Mark-Up language (XML); Firewall architecture; Information integrity; Organizational boundaries; Secure communications; Network security"

Security and privacy incidents and further risks in organizations are influenced by the technological environment as well as by the behavior of staff. But a large part of information security research is technicaloriented with limited consideration of behavioral and organizational issues. An analysis of diverse studies presented in this paper adopts a broader perspective and shows a better understanding of information security with regard to the ""human factor"". To ensure this broader perspective of information security this paper first focuses on a literature review analyzing influences on people's behavior whilst also taking related organizational issues into account. The literature review concentrates on the one hand on a more internal-oriented level (security awareness approaches, policies and programs as well as support from top management) and on the other hand on a more external-oriented level (training of managers and employees). In a next step empirical studies-worldwide and covering European countries-are presented and analyzed regarding influences of the ""human factor"" on information security. The paper closes with a summary of the findings, a critical view on possible limitations and managerial implications. Results show that beside technical requirements the ""people factor"" plays a crucial role to secure and protect organizations' critical information and data. Dangerous aspects on information security within organizations are being underestimated from both the management as well as from employees themselves. Awareness training is still less pronounced and implemented as well as in a large part not being consistent with organizations' security policies, awareness programs, and other specific circumstances of each organization.","Data protection; Empirical study analysis; Human factor; Information security; Information security policy/program/training; Managerial implications","Human engineering; Human resource management; Management; Managers; Network security; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Awareness program; Corporate information; Critical information; Data protection; Empirical studies; Information security policies; IT professional; Large parts; Literature reviews; Managerial implications; Organizational issues; Security and privacy; Security awareness; Security policy; Technical requirement; Technological environment; Top management; Personnel training"

Thus, the roles of Human Resource Management (HRM) become more salient with ISM. Unlike practitioners, researchers appear reluctant to acknowledge such emergence. Prior literature has not attempted to link ISM with HRM theoretically. ISM literature suggests that both technical and non-technical aspects be simultaneously considered. Similarly, HRM literature recommends that practices such as staffing and training be treated as a bundle. Evidently, both ISM and HRM teams require a pool of specialized knowledge and skills to manage each of their aspects. Moreover, both teams should collaborate in order to improve the ISM performance of the firm. However, the amount of the knowledge may become overloading to both teams. This paper posits that Transactive Memory System (TMS) can support not only knowledge coordination when each team operates independently, but also alleviate the knowledge overload when both teams collaborate. Furthermore, this paper proposes that such collaboration via TMS enables an organization to not only manage its ISM more effectively but ultimately produce sustainable competitive advantage.

In our research, we have investigated accepted models of perceptions of risk and characteristics unique to insider threat, and we have introduced ordinal scales to these models to measure insider perceptions of risk. We have also investigated decision theories, leading to a conclusion that Prospect Theory, developed by Tversky and Kahneman, may be used to describe the risk-taking behavior of insiders and can be accommodated in our model. We discuss the results of validating that model with thirty-five senior information security executives from a variety of organizations. We also discuss how the model may be used to identify characteristics of insiders' perceptions of risk and benefit, their risk-taking behavior and how to frame insider decisions.","","Risk perception; Security of data; Security systems; Human dimensions; Insider Threat; Ordinal scale; Perceptions of risks; Prospect theory; Risk-taking behaviors; Risk assessment"

In this paper a methodology is proposed that bridges the gap between security requirements and architecture design development at the enterprise level.

This is because, especially with regulatory compliance, both business and government have to expect large financial and reputational losses if compliance cannot be ensured and demonstrated. One major difficulty of implementing such regulations is caused the fact that they are captured at a high level of abstraction that is business-centric and not IT centric. This means that the abstract intent needs to be translated in a trustworthy, traceable way into compliance and security policies that the IT security infrastructure can enforce. Carrying out this mapping process manually is time consuming, maintenance-intensive, costly, and error-prone. Compliance monitoring is also critical in order to be able to demonstrate compliance at any given point in time. The problem is further complicated because of the need for business-driven IT agility, where IT policies and enforcement can change frequently, e.g. Business Process Modelling (BPM) driven Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Model Driven Security (MDS) is an innovative technology approach that can solve these problems as an extension of identity and access management (IAM) and authorization management (also called entitlement management). In this paper we will illustrate the theory behind Model Driven Security for compliance, provide an improved and extended architecture, as well as a case study in the healthcare industry using our OpenPMF 2.0 technology. © 2009 Vieweg+Teubner | GWV Fachverlage GmbH, Wiesbaden.","","Information services; Information technology; Security of data; Security systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Authorization management; Business process modelling; Compliance monitoring; High level of abstraction; Identity and access managements; Innovative technology; Model driven security; Model-driven securities; Regulatory compliance"

These processes are developed to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IT systems. There are various aspects to IT security in an organization that need to be considered. These include security policies and procedures, security organization structure, IT security processes, and rules and regulations. Security policies and procedures are essential for implementing IT security management-authorizing security roles and responsibilities to various security personnel; setting rules for expected behavior from users and security role players; setting rules for business continuity plans; and more. The security policy should generally be agreed to by most personnel in the organization and should have support from the highest-level management. This helps in prioritization at the overall organization level. The IT security processes are essentially part of an organization's risk management processes and business continuity strategies. In a business environment marked by globalization, organizations have to be aware of both national and international rules and regulations.

This can only happen when there is a robust information exchange facilitation mechanism in place, which can help in taking quick and legitimate steps in dealing with any kind of emergent situation. Prior literature in the field of information assurance has focused on building defense mechanisms to protect assets and reduce vulnerability to foreign attacks. Nevertheless, information assurance does not simply mean building an impermeable membrane and safeguarding information, but also implies letting information be securely shared, if required, among a set of related groups or organizations that serve a common purpose. This chapter will revolve around the central pivot of Information Sharing. Further, to study the relative significance of various information dimensions in different disaster situations, content analyses are conducted. The results hence obtained can be used to develop a prioritization framework for different disaster response activities, thus to increase the mitigation efficiency. We will also explore roles played by few existing organizations and technologies across the globe that are actively involved in Information Sharing to mitigate the impact of disasters and extreme events. © 2009, IGI Global.","",""

Today information is probably worth much more than any other commodity. Globalization, the other important phenomenon of the times we live in, has taken the value of information to new heights. Citizens of one country now feel entitled to know exactly what is happening in other countries around the globe. To this end, the capabilities of the Internet have been put to use and people have become accustomed to receiving information about everyone and everything as soon as it becomes available. This chapter demonstrates that IW is not only possible, it has already taken place and is growing internationally as a preferred way of warfare. It also demonstrates that successful strategies, offensive or defensive, are dependent on taking a holistic view of the matter. Information security professionals should refrain from focusing only on the technical aspects of this area, since it is shown that legal frameworks, national as well as international, also have to be considered. The prevailing challenge for countries around the globe is to foster collaboration among lawyers, information security professionals, and technical IT professionals. They should continue striving to at least keep the registry of IW arsenal and remedies updated, which may, in turn, incite adversaries to provide more material for research. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Medical records contain personal data and are as such protected by EU and member states' legislation. Medical data, in addition to being personal data, is also defined in the EU legislation as being especially sensitive and warrants special measures to protect it. It therefore follows that various legal issues and concerns arise in connection with these processes. Such issues relate to the merits of compiling a nationwide database, deciding on who has access to such a database, legitimate uses of medical data held, protection of medical data, and subject access rights amongst others. This chapter examines some of these issues and argues that such databases are inevitable due to technological change; however there are major legal and information security caveats that have to be addressed.

When a fraudulent online transaction occurs and the online customer disputes the transaction, in many European countries, the online customer takes responsibility for the proof of her or his argument, whereas in the United States, the burden of proof lies with the firm. This paper analyzes corollaries of the two different legal systems and discusses why different regulations exist from the perspective of e-commerce laws. We found that, in a market or society where the elasticity for security investment is relatively high, the legal system that imposes the burdens of proof on firms results in Pareto superior and e-commerce firms achieve higher profitability in equilibrium than the legal system that burdens the onus on customers. In addition, we found that, in some range of the elasticity for security investment, return of the security investment of firms in the first legal system is higher than that in the other legal system in the equilibrium.","E-commerce law; Electronic commerce; Electronic commerce regulation; Onus of proof; Security and privacy","Elasticity; Electronic commerce; Industry; Information systems; Investments; Profitability; Sales; Security of data; Burden of proof; European Countries; Fraudulent transactions; Legal system; On-line payment; Online customers; Online transaction; Onus of proof; Optimal investments; Security and privacy; Security investments; Laws and legislation"

From a security perspective, these products are often limited and coarse grained in their authorization and authentication. For example, in a Wiki, the security model is often at two ends of the spectrum: anonymous users with no authorization and limited access via read-only browsing vs. registered users with full-range of access and limited oversight in content creation and modification. However, in practice, such full and unfettered access may not be appropriate for all users and for all applications, particularly as the collaborative technology moves into commercial usage (where copyright and intellectual property are vital) or sensitive domains such as healthcare (which have stringent HIPAA requirements).

Internal documents transmitted without encryption through the open mobile networks undoubtedly creates security holes for eavesdroppers. A common way to provide preliminary protections for an important document to be accessed outside the Intranet is to transmit the document after encryption. Such mechanisms, however, cannot assure the security of documents because the documents can be decrypted and then forwarded without protections once the ciphering keys were known. Therefore, we propose an approach to enhance the security of transmitted mobile documents, using the idea from digital rights managements. A confidential document is encrypted so that, except the targeted mobile user, none can read the confidential document without proper rights. The proposed approach utilizes the trusted computing platforms (TPM) technology to protect the rights object of a confidential document. A rights object can be as simple as a ciphering key of the document or as complicated as the usage-rules of the document. We use the public key in TPM to encrypt the rights object so that only the dedicated mobile device, i.e. The mobile user, may decrypt the rights object using the private key of the device. A malicious user can never decrypt the rights to access the transmitted document, which is encrypted. Moreover, the usage-rules in the rights object may specify whether the document can be further forwarded or be read more than once, and so on. Therefore, the proposed scheme provides maximum flexibilities for mobile employees to access confidential documents without compromising the security, in addition to the mobility and timeliness of mobile environments.","Digital rights management; Information security; Mobile enterprise; Trusted computing platforms","Cryptography; Electronic commerce; Global system for mobile communications; Industry; Mobile devices; Security of data; Digital Rights Management; Mobile access; Mobile enterprise; Mobile environments; Mobile users; Private key; Public keys; Security holes; Trusted computing platform; Copyrights"

However, the users of the network centric environment have various kinds of demands for information security, resulting in a variety of security domains. The purpose of multilevel security is to allow users from different security domains to share and process classified information using a common network infrastructure.

Multilevel security is discussed considering content, communication, and network security levels. Multilevel security on the content level includes cross domain information sharing and accessibility issues. On the communication level, communication protocol and signaling issues are discussed. The network level deals with authentication and physical network access challenges.

Our results reveal an increase in cohesiveness of 200% in the network linking the information security firms and the IT firms considered in our analysis. This, in turn, implies a move towards industry convergence.

There have been several recent efforts to develop a common reference for rating the information risk posed by partners. We develop a simple analytical model to examine the impact of such information security ratings on service providers, customers, and social welfare. While some might believe that ratings would benefit high-security providers and hurt those with lower security, we show that this is not always the case. We find that information security ratings can hurt both types of providers or benefit both, depending on the market conditions. Surprisingly, we also find that security ratings do not always benefit the most demanding customers who desire highly secure business partners. Yet, in all cases, we find that social welfare is improved when information security ratings are adopted. This result suggests that information security ratings should be encouraged through public policy initiatives. © (2009) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","Economics of Information Security; Information Security Rating; Information Systems; IT Policy and Management","Information systems; Rating; Business partners; Economics of information; Information risk; IT policies; Market condition; Policy initiatives; Security breaches; Service provider; Social welfare; Value chains; Security of data"

It is quite possible that during sharing and exchange, the private data also gets hacked. In order to protect and secure the private data, the protocols of SMC need to be deployed in the large computer networks on which the organizations work. The protocols work at the micro-level in terms of cryptography with which the data is encrypted and then shared while allowing the keys to be used for sharable data while keeping the keys untouched for private data. At macro level, the multilevel architectures are used for different types of security to be achieved. The computation part of the secured multiparty computation is based on the algorithmic complexity theory. The algorithms realize the protocols in such a way that it is tedious to break (decrypt) the keys to hack the private data. Computational complexities of such algorithms are non-polynomial and the computers may take long time to break the keys. In this paper, we will show how our SMC protocols prevent the data of an organization during the war from the cyberspace when a large number of defense units interact with one another, while hiding the identity and computations done by them.","Correctness; Cyberspace; Privacy; Secure multi-party computation (SMC); Security; Trusted third party (TTP)","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Cryptography; Data privacy; Electronic data interchange; Security of data; Correctness; Cyberspaces; Secure multi-party computation; Security; Trusted third parties; Computers"

So, organizations must try to guarantee at all times information's fundamental properties: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Information Systems are a determining factor for the organization's capability, consisting of a tool that stimulates its productivity, indispensable in the decision making process at the various levels of management. The current network society supported primarily through Internet, presents new threats to information networks that support organizational Information Systems, independently of their dimension, nature, organization and technological resources. This scenario requires the utilization of a Security Framework in order to guarantee the information security, and also to integrate a set of different organizational views: a scientific community (conceptual model); decider's perception (behavioural model); and a technological model, as support for business processes. An established security policy and operational identification and evaluation methodology of risk must be distinguished in order to protect an organization from threats towards its information systems or information resources which it is responsible for. In this paper we propose a Security Framework for organizational Information Systems, to guarantee the security of the major information actives and to serve as a possible model of security information management, to supporting the decision making process on information security and management.

Information security concerns itself with the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and the information or data they contain and process. An intrusion, then, is any action taken by an adversary that has a negative impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of that information. Having physical access to a computer system allows an adversary to bypass most security protections put in place to prevent unauthorized access. By stealing a computer system, the adversary has all the physical access he could want, and unless the sensitive data on the system is encrypted, the data is very likely to be compromised. With the increasing importance of information systems in today's complex and global economy, it has become mission and business critical to defend those information systems from attack and compromise by any number of adversaries. Intrusion prevention and detection systems are critical components in the defender's arsenal and take on a number of different forms. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are systems that attempt to actually stop an active attack or security problem. Though there are many IDS and IPS products on the market today, often sold as self-contained, network-attached computer appliances, truly effective intrusion detection and prevention are achieved when viewed as a process coupled with layers of appropriate technologies and products. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

When a business implements and maintains a strong security posture, it can take advantage of numerous benefits. An organization that can demonstrate an infrastructure protected by robust security mechanisms can potentially see a reduction in insurance premiums being paid. A secure organization can use its security program as a marketing tool, demonstrating to clients that it values their business so much that it takes a very aggressive stance on protecting their information. Security breaches can cost an organization significantly through a tarnished reputation, lost business, and legal fees. Numerous regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, require businesses to maintain the security of information. Security, by its very nature, is inconvenient, and the more robust the security mechanisms, the more inconvenient the process becomes. Most security mechanisms, from passwords to multifactor authentication, are seen as roadblocks to productivity. Despite the benefits of maintaining a secure organization and the potentially devastating consequences of not doing so, many organizations have poor security mechanisms, implementations, policies, and culture. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Information security policy is often described as part of these frameworks. Information security policy is therefore considered an essential tool for information security management by most relevant sources. Though information security in small companies faces the same requirements as in large companies, some differences do exist. Companies generally dispose of limited resources (e.g. time and money) to spend on information security measures. At the same time the amount and type of information to be protected is different. Most information security policies are drafted from the viewpoint of large companies. Small companies often have to translate policies that had been written for major companies in order to fit their needs: a costly contextual adjustment.However, how these policies can be applied, and which parts can be left out (due to the size of the company) is not much discussed in literature. Empirical materials show that small companies often simply choose not to document information security policies. This paper introduces work inspired by the parallel established between the literature and existing practice in small companies. The paper analyses several information security policy guidelines from the viewpoint of small companies. The guidelines are analyzed on how they instruct the documentation of information security policy, and whether they offer any alternatives. Empirical findings from interviews in small Finnish companies are reflected upon based on this analysis. Through a series of interviews conducted in support of the comparative analysis, the reasons for documenting or not documenting information security policy are discussed, along with other information security management issues. The ultimate goal of the paper is to offer an informative discussion on how certain information security policy guidelines could be applied to meet the needs of small companies.","Information security management; Information security policy; Small company","Industrial management; Industry; Security systems; Comparative analysis; Empirical findings; Finnish; Information security managements; Information security policies; Small companies; Security of data"

Unfortunately, these home users typically represent a group of users who are generally poorly educated about the dangers and threats that exist when connected to the Internet. To this end, security vendors have provided a variety of integrated security solutions that provide Anti-Virus, Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems to enable home users to become better protected. However, the need to rely upon users to make decisions about potential threats they have little or no information about is concerning at best. An analysis of user interfaces that relate to security have shown they frequently lack in providing usable interfaces that users are able to make informed decisions from. The aim of the paper is to support these home users by proposing a set of novel design criteria to enable the development of usable security alerts which are triggered by home security mechanisms. Drawing from literature, the criteria that are proposed take into account the unique usability issues that exist when dealing with information security: explicit and useful information, the ability to make a timely response and a consistent presentation of information. A walkthrough using a potentially problematic dialog from Norton 360 is used as a case study to highlight the current issues with the interfaces and to evaluate the proposed criteria. The findings of the evaluation reveal that the novel criteria are promising and the assessment of other security tools are required to make consistent and valuable recommendations.","Home users; Human computer interaction; Intrusion detection systems; Norton 360; Security; Usability","Human computer interaction; Internet; Network security; User interfaces; Viruses; Home users; Intrusion Detection Systems; Norton 360; Security; Usability; Computer viruses"

Attacks to network infrastructure affect large portions of the Internet at a time and create large amounts of service disruption, due to breaches such as IP spoofing, routing table poisoning and routing loops. Daily operations around the world highly depend on the availability and reliability of the Internet, which makes the security of this infrastructure a top priority issue in the field. Network Infrastructure Security is a book that bridges the gap between the study of the traffic flow of networks and the study of the actual network configuration. This book makes effective use of examples and figures to illustrate network infrastructure attacks from a theoretical point of view.

The protection of this data is usually described as maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the organization's assets, operations, and information. For information security managers, it is crucial to maintain a clear perspective of all the areas of business that require protection. Through collaboration with all business units, security managers must work security into the processes of all aspects of the organization, from employee training to research and development. Security is not an IT problem, but a business problem. Information security is a business problem in the sense that the entire organization must frame and solve security problems based on its own strategic drivers, not solely on technical controls aimed to mitigate one type of attack. Security goes beyond technical controls and encompasses people, technology, policy, and operations in a way that few other business objectives do. The evolution of a risk-based paradigm, as opposed to a technical solution paradigm for security, has made it clear that a secure organization does not result from securing technical infrastructure alone. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Firms may over- or under-invest in security because security investments generate network externalities. In this paper, we explore how firms can use three risk management approaches, third-party cyber insurance, managed security service (MSS) and risk pooling arrangement (RPA), to address the issue of investment inefficiency. We show that compared with cyber insurance, MSS is more effective in mitigating the security investment inefficiency because the MSS provider (MSSP) serving multiple firms can endogenize the externalities of security investments. However, the investment externalities may discourage a for-profit MSSP from serving all firms even on a monopoly market. We then show that firms can use RPA as a complement to cyber insurance to address risk interdependency for all firms. However, the adoption of RPA is incentive-compatible for firms only when the security investments generate negative externalities.","Cyberinsurance; Economics of information systems; Information security; Managed security service; Risk management; Risk pooling","Industry; Information systems; Insurance; Investments; Profitability; Risk management; Satellites; Security of data; Cyberinsurance; Economics of information; Managed security; Monopoly markets; Negative externalities; Network externality; Risk pooling; Security investments; Economics"

This paper examined the information security policy of a government organisation in response to a number of perceived shortcomings. The specific issues identified relating to the organisations security policy as a result of this investigation were as follows: a culture of ignoring policies, minimal awareness of policies, minimal policy enforcement, policy updating and review ad hoc at best, policy framework, lengthy policy development and approval process, no compliance program, no formal non-compliance reporting and an apparent inconsistent enforcement across the whole of the organisation. In response to these identified issues, the following recommendations were made to improve the information security of the organisation: changing the organisations culture, creating an awareness mechanism for policies, improving the organisations culture, create an ICT policy awareness programme, review and re-write existing policies, policy enforcement, policy compliance, policy noncompliance reporting, policy updating and review, improve the policy development and approval process, policy compliance checking and uniform policy enforcement. Whilst it is also likely that a lack of governance contributed to these issues, this aspect was not addressed in this paper.

Women tend to choose ISA less often than their male counterparts and tend to drop out sooner. ISA educators can increase recruiting potential and assist in retaining women by using a variety of strategies. Educators should diversify the curriculum and show interdisciplinary links between ISA and other fields. They should use real-world examples to show the practical use of ISA. Professors should integrate gender-inclusive and gender-equitable techniques into the classroom. Educators should revisit ISA curriculum, and remove or revise gatekeeper courses where possible. Finally, they should implement formal mentoring policies to give women a sense of community in ISA. While these strategies alone will not increase the number of women who select ISA as a major, they are a valuable first step towards leveling the playing field and welcoming women to the male-dominated ISA club.

A primary focus is training live participants in a realistic field environment. Real time data is collected on the participants and used in After Action Reviews to greatly improve training. PEO STRI has developed various standards in this domain, which provide an efficient way to design, develop, and operate interoperable, nonstove- piped training solutions. Specifically these standards include a common service-oriented architecture for camera control and video handling; a common protocol to control and obtain feedback from field devices like popup targets and effects; room lighting and sound control, and even smell generators; a common protocol for communicating with participant instrumentation networks that report real time position/location information and status indoors and in open terrain; and a runtime terrain service that supports a broad range of terrain capabilities for interaction with live, virtual, and constructive simulations. These standards establish appropriate development guidelines and interface definitions in order to maximize industry involvement in developing product-line solutions and providing advanced training capabilities through technology insertion. In addition, these standards allow a new level of interoperability among participating industry vendors, greater opportunity for taking advantage of legacy technology, and greater vendor depth in providing product solutions. Finally, these standards work hand in hand with information assurance requirements and provide a new flexibility in system accreditation. This paper provides an overview and lessons learned in the cooperative effort between government and industry to establish these standard initiatives.

We argue that the traditional orientation of these methodologies, towards the identification and assessment of technical information assets, obscures key risks associated with the cultivation and deployment of organisational knowledge. Our argument is developed through an illustrative case study in which a well-documented methodology is applied to a complex data back-up process. This process is seen to depend, in subtle and often informal ways, on knowledge to sustain operational complexity, handle exceptions and make frequent interventions. Although typical information security methodologies identify people as critical assets, we suggest a new approach might draw on more detailed accounts of individual knowledge, collective knowledge, and their relationship to organisational processes. Drawing on the knowledgemanagement literature, we suggest mechanisms to incorporate these knowledge-based considerations into the scope of information security risk methodologies. ©2009 [Author/s names].","Asset identification; Information security; Knowledge protection; Risk management","Knowledge based systems; Risk management; Asset identification; Complex data; Critical asset; Information security risk assessment; Knowledge perspective; Knowledge protection; Operational complexity; Organisational knowledge; Security methodologies; Security risks; Technical information; Security of data"

A complicating factor towards this security is the multi-jurisdictional nature of some critical infrastructure assets e.g., telecommunications or financial systems. Information systems (IS) and information technology are playing an ever more important role in the security of a nation's (state, territory, or province's) critical infrastructure. This longitudinal study investigates public sector critical infrastructure incidents across nine sectors in an Australia state - New South Wales. The New South Wales State Government is the largest by full-time employees in Australia. An action research methodology was employed. Data was collected by online survey, complemented by interviews and secondary data searches. Results were reinforced from independent sources. Our main finding is that NSW State Government IS security incidents against critical infrastructure assets are decreasing in both nominal and relative terms over time as prevention techniques and solutions are increasingly becoming available. However, we must be cautious in making causal inferences or generalising to other organisational situations without further study investigating other exogenous determinants.","Critical infrastructure; Cyber crime; Identity crime; IS security incidents","Computer crime; Information systems; Public works; Security of data; Action research; Australia; Business transaction; Cyber-crimes; Data searches; Digital security; Financial system; Full-time employees; Longitudinal study; New South Wales; Online surveys; Public sector; Security incident; State governments; Critical infrastructures"

The method defines the key performance indicator of the business process (the process period) as the risk scale, so changes in the process period indicate the risk. The occurrence of threads affects the operation of the information system, eventually resulting in state transitions of business process/activities hosted by the information system. The changes in the process period (i.e., risk) are obtained by analyzing the state transitions. Therefore, information security risk calculation is converted into solving for changes of the business process period. Test using this algorithm show that the influence of threats to the information system on the business system can be calculated, thereby confirming the accuracy and validity of the algorithm.","Business process (BP); Business risk; Information security; Risk assessment","Benchmarking; Information systems; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Business process; Business risks; Business systems; Information security; Information security risk assessment; Key performance indicators; State transitions; Security of data"

However, biometrics possess major drawbacks in their inability, if lost or stolen, to be revoked and re-issued as would be the case with passwords. Also, once a biometric source has been compromised, the owner of the biometric as well as the data protected by the biometrie is compromised for life. These concerns have necessitated research in template free biometrics and revocable biometrics. However, template free and revocable biometrics are challenged by the integrity of the owner of the biometrie sensor who may pre-record biometrie samples, the owner of the algorithm who may have and use privilege rights to decipher measurable values unique to individuals or an attacker. This research introduces a new concept that takes away the control of biometric system from the either the owner of the biometric sensor or the owner of the algorithm and at the same time denies an attacker any opportunity to fraudulently author information or compromise data protected by biometrics. Our method essentially disguises the biometric information used for cryptography, does not store any template values, and reverses cryptographic information at every instance of calibration and operation in a template free system, thus revoking previously generated information from the same user candidate.","Cancellable biometrics; Cryptography; Information security; Revocable biometrics; Template-free biometrics","Algorithms; Authentication; Computer vision; Cryptography; Security of data; Sensors; Biometric informations; Biometric security systems; Biometric sensors; Biometric systems; Cancellable biometric; Personal authentication; Template-free; Biometrics"

One such challenge, though often overlooked, is that of the threat posed by users. Whilst a variety of methods are available to control this, none have been particularly successful. An alternative suggested in the literature is the use of organisational culture via corporate governance to improve the security behaviours of individuals (Thomson & von Solms, 2005; von Solms & von Solms, 2004; Mishra & Dhillon, 2006). At the core of these alternative theories is the assumption that culture affects information security, though no literature could be found that tests this relationship. Previous research into the effects of organisational culture on other aspects of an organisation has lead to uncertainty as to the existence of such a relationship, and therefore it needs to be evaluated before these theories can be tested or further utilised. The purpose of this study is twofold, viz, to test the relationship between organisational culture and information security behaviour, and to test the viability of using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method advocated by Chin & Newstead (1999) for this type of research. A model was developed to represent information security attitudes, which, combined with Hofstede's (1990) model of culture, was used to develop the survey. The model and survey were piloted via interview in the organisations. The results lead us to question the existence of a relationship between organisational culture and information security attitudes. © 2009 Greg Stephens & Kenneth J Stevens.","Information security; IT governance; Organization culture; PLS; User attitudes","Information systems; Surveys; Corporate culture; Corporate governance; Information systems security; IT governance; Organisational culture; Organization culture; Partial least square (PLS); PLS; Thomson; User attitudes; Security of data"

Identity crime, related cybercrimes and information systems security breaches are insidious motivators for governments and organizations to protect and secure their systems, databases and other assets against intrusion and loss. Managing identity crime is a critical step in cyber security and global information assurance. Strategy components and conceptual model elements are constructed through analysis and synthesis of models from academic literature, and reports by industry and government professionals. A comprehensive government strategy with a legislative component reinforces organizational policies to combat identity crimes. Model components used to develop our identity fraud organizational framework were selected from cost of identity fraud, identity risk management, identity fraud profiling, and fraud risk management literature. Our framework is organized into anticipatory, reactionary and remediation phases. © 2009, IGI Global.","",""

Digital audio, video and pictures are increasingly furnished with distinguishing but imperceptible marks. Palette images are widely used in multimedia and Internet applications. In this project, a new method for data hiding in palette images with security protection by color ordering and mapping is suggested. First, image pixels are classified as data embeddable or non embeddable, and only the former ones are used to embed secret data. The proposed idea of data hiding is based on the use of a new type of color-ordering relationship, from which a color-mapping function is defined with binary values as output. When a secret data bit is to embed, a data embeddable pixel is selected; its color is adjusted to make the output of color-mapping function equal to the secret bit value. The embedded secret data can be extracted correctly and quickly from the resulting stego-image by merely inspecting the outputs of the color-mapping function This paper contains modified algorithm [1] in which parameters are randomized.

The server and system easily can be unstable because of increased volume overloaded by an internal connection. The delay and even the network failure of system can occurs server down. To solve these problems, the clustering resources must be distributed effectively to the internal infrastructure system. Nowadays high availability clustering and load balacing (HALB) is necessary for availability of clustering mechanism of information sysetm. HALB is a system structure and functional hierarchy for interactive load euquality and load balancing system of each network area. If one server of some network domain fails, the other server of another domain migrates as a backup server under the multiplexing clustering mechanism through the load-balancing and high availability function. To achieve the best distributed computing, this mechanism is based on the value of critical path through dynamic load euquality policy and efficiency management of server resources. This paper provides a experimental test and recomands HALB as a test result, because the test shows that the HALB method is more effective in the load balancing between servers and packet filtering schedulings than that of traditional. © 2009 ACM.","clustering; load balacing; security","Dynamic loads; Information technology; Network management; Parallel architectures; Back-up servers; Clustering mechanism; Critical Paths; Distributed Computing; Experimental test; Functional hierarchy; High availability; Information security; Information security systems; Infrastructure systems; Internal connections; Load balancing systems; Load-Balancing; Network area; Network domains; Network failure; Packet filtering; Server resources; System structures; Test results; Servers"

We start by giving an introduction to the concept of image encryption and its main technologies, and an overview of the chaotic cellular neural network. We then discuss the proposed image encryption algorithm in details, which is followed by a number of security analyses (key space analysis, sensitivity analysis, information entropy analysis and statistical analysis).

Technical solutions can only protect information so far and thus the human aspect of security has become a major focus for discussion. Therefore, it is important for organisations to create a security conscious culture. However, currently there is no established representation of security culture from which to assess how it can be manoeuvred to improve the overall information security of an organization. This is of particular importance for small organizations who lack the resources in information security and for whom the culture of the organization exerts a strong influence. A review of multiple definitions and descriptions of security culture was made to assess and analyse the drivers and influences that exist for security culture in small organizations. An initial representation of the factors that should drive security culture, together with those that should only influence it, was constructed. At a fundamental level these drivers are related to a formulated response to security issues rather than a reaction to it, and should reflect the responsibility allocated in a secure environment. In contrast, the influences on security culture can be grouped by communities of practice, individual awareness and organizational management. The encapsulation of potential driving and influencing factors couched in information security terms rather than behavioural science terms, will allow security researchers to investigate how a security culture can be fostered to improve information security in small organizations. © 2009 Patricia A H Williams.","Behaviour; Communities of practice; Culture; Information security; Security culture","Behavioral research; Cell culture; Industrial management; Societies and institutions; Behaviour; Behavioural science; Communities of Practice; Human aspects; Human components; Influencing factor; Organizational management; Protect information; Security issues; Small organizations; Technical solutions; Security of data"

Since microsoft service network (MSN) Messenger is one of the most widely used Internet communication protocols currently, this paper presents method to analyze the features of MSN VoIP (voice over IP) packets to identify convert information. A sliding window method is used to sample the VoIP stream to detect covert communications using steganography on the PCM (pulse code modulation) speech code using the LSB (least significant bit) algorithm. These methods effectively provide real-time online detection of covert communications. Tests demonstrate that these methods achieve better performance, with a high identification ratio for MSN VoIP streams and a high correctness ratio in covert communication detection. Hence, these methods can provide practical steganalyses.","Covert communication; Microsoft service network (MSN); Steganography; Voice over IP (VoIP) identification","Communication; Internet protocols; Internet telephony; Pulse code modulation; Steganography; Covert channels; Covert communications; Data stream; Information security; Internet communication; Key issues; Least significant bits; Media streams; MicroSoft; Network communications; On-line detection; Service network; Sliding window methods; Voice over IP; Voice/data communication systems"

In this paper, we suggest that it is important not only to include the general use of simulation in various courses of the security curriculum, but also to include the theory and development of simulation models. We describe briefly the general features of simulation models and tools for model development that we are using in computing education. A collection of educational simulation tools have been created in the OOPsim project, for developing discrete-event simulation models. The principal goal of this project is to develop newer simulation tools and approaches for education in computing. The Object Oriented Simulation Language, OOSimL, was recently developed with partial support from an NSF CPATH grant. Two object-oriented simulation models are discussed as typical examples discussed in a simulation course on security: a model of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) and a model of simple firewall system. These models were developed with educational simulation tools created in OOPsim project. We have also developed a course that emphasizes an approach to early introduction to object-oriented discrete-event simulation. The DDoS simulation model is implemented using the OOSimL simulation language. The Firewall simulation model was implemented in Java with the PsimJ2 object oriented simulation package; other models have been implemented in C++ using the Psim3 object oriented simulation package. The simulation tools and model development are very useful for educating and training students and professionals in information security, computer science, software engineering, information technology, and in other related disciplines.

It is often an elective or graduate level course. Information Security is an important topic that can be introduced early and often throughout the undergraduate curriculum. Security is pervasive in all disciplines of computerrelated fields and early introduction not only would underscore its importance but begin skill development. Rather than labeling security as only one of the many specialized areas, it should also be incorporated into all areas. Increased worldwide connectivity enhances the need for security. Surprisingly, security has yet to meaningfully penetrate the undergraduate curriculum. This paper describes ways to introduce information security early in the CS and IS curricula. Students are taught to consider information security through real world scenarios and relevant exercises. Several security topics of interest are discussed along with an account of experiences teaching CS1 with Python. The foundation that is laid down through early exposure will give students the ability to automatically consider security issues in their future work. Security can be integrated into the problem solving process, from problem conception to project completion.

This technology uses higher regions of the spectrum, and offers unsurpassed throughput, information security, reduced weight and size of the components, and power savings. Unfortunately, small beam divergence requires precise positioning, which becomes very critical at high data rates. Complex motion patterns of the communicating platforms, vibrations, and atmospheric effects cause significant signal losses due to the pointing errors, beam wander, and other higher order effects. Mitigation of those effects is achieved by fast tracking, which can be successfully combined with signal modulation. In this work, we focus on the application of acousto-optic technology and its effect on communication performance. We present experimental results for a laser communication link affected by pointing distortions. These distortions are generated to emulate specific operation environments with particular spectral characteristics. The acousto-optic technology is used to build an agile tracking system combined with signal modulation in the same device to assure maximum signal reception, in spite of the harsh operational conditions. The received communication signal is recorded and statistically analyzed to calculate the bit error rates. This work presents synthesis of a tracking system and experimental results characterizing the communication performance under uncompensated pointing disturbance and with tracking. © 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","acousto-optic modulation; bit error rate; Bragg cell; quadrant detector; tracking","Acoustooptical effects; Bragg cells; Communication; Integrated optics; Modulation; Navigation; Optical links; Security of data; Telecommunication systems; Tracking (position); Acousto-optic modulations; Acousto-optics; Atmospheric effects; Beam divergence; Beam-wander; Broadband applications; Communication performance; Communication signals; Complex motion; Experimental studies; Fast-Tracking; High data rate; Higher order effects; Information security; Laser communication links; Laser communication system; Operational conditions; Pointing errors; Power savings; Precise positioning; Quadrant detectors; Signal loss; Signal modulations; Signal reception; Spectral characteristics; Technology use; tracking; Tracking system; Bit error rate"

In recent years, there has been emergence in the fusion/combination of multi-biometric traits to further enhance the performance of biometric systems. The latter are commonly known as multi-biometric systems. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the fusion of iris images prior to the feature level where we model the iris textures using the Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD). Then, a systematic pattern retrieval algorithm is applied in order to improve the accuracy of overall system. Normalized iris sub-images are fused based on a specific quality measure.

The acceptance of risk analysis methods in ICT strictly requires the inclusion of IT security issues and associated standards. The full performance of risk analysis to support the ranking of hazards or threats and prioritisation of measurements is often unknown to IT practitioners.

The ontology can be used as a general vocabulary, roadmap and extensible dictionary of the domain of information security. With its help, users can agree on a common language and definition of terms and relationships. In addition to browsing for information, the ontology is also useful for reasoning about relationships between its entities, that is, threats and countermeasures. The ontology helps answer questions like: Which countermeasures detect or prevent the violation of integrity of data? Which assets are protected by SSH? Which countermeasures thwart buffer overflow attacks? At the moment, the ontology comprises 88 threat classes, 79 asset classes, 133 countermeasure classes and 34 relations between those classes. The authors provide means for extending the ontology, and provide examples of the extendibility with the countermeasure classes ""memory protection"" and ""source code analysis"".

Face detection is done by adapting the Viola and Jones algorithm that is based on the Adaboost learning system. For robust tracking of faces across real-life illumination conditions, we leverage the algorithm proposed by Thota and others, that combines the strengths of Adaboost and an image based parametric illumination model. We design and develop optimized parallel implementations of these algorithms on graphics processors using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), a C-based programming model from NVIDIA. We evaluate our face processing system using both static image databases as well as using live frames captured from a firewire camera under realistic conditions. Our experimental results indicate that our parallel face detector and tracker achieve much greater detection speeds as compared to existing work, while maintaining accuracy.

Using a literature review, approaches to measuring information security governance were analysed for their potential suitability and use within General Practice for the effective protection of confidential information. The models, frameworks and guidelines selected were analysed to evaluate if they were Key Performance Indicator (KPI), or process driven; whether the approach taken was strategic, tactical or operational; and if governance or management assessment tools were presented. To measure information security governance, and be both effective and practical, the approach to be utilised within General Practice would need to function at an operational level and be KPI driven. Eight of the 29 approaches identified, were deemed to be applicable for measuring information security governance within the General Practice environment. However, further analysis indicated that these measurement approaches were either too complex to be directly implemented into General Practice, or collected self-assessment security data rather than actual security measurements.

Attacks against networks are rapidly becoming stealthier and more distributed by breaking up an attack into multiple steps spread across multiple hosts. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed information fusion framework using software agents working across networks, which is capable of detecting this type of attack. Using domain knowledge, this framework decomposes the detection process into multiple steps by first identifying locking points of relevant attacks from massive amount of network traffic data, and then zooms into the related hosts to build attack contexts around these locking points. Combining this information with domain knowledge from security analysts finally enables characterization of attack scenarios. Our experiments using the Skaion data show that our framework can accurately identify the majority of the steps contained in highly sophisticated and novel attack scenarios with very few false positives.","Anomaly detection; Correlation; Information fusion; Intrusion detection; Software agent","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Information fusion; Intrusion detection; Optical correlation; Software agents; Anomaly detection; Attack scenarios; Detection process; Distributed information fusion; Domain knowledge; False positive; Information collections; Network attack; Network traffic; Computer crime"

Most organizations have experienced misalignment between security requirements and control mechanisms in information systems that lead to over-protection or inadequate protection. This is usually due to inconsistencies of the information system security objectives relative to the organization's management objectives and lack of organization-wide risk management approaches to analyze security requirements and control schemes. This paper uses enterprise architecture (EA) as a management tool for the information system development life cycle (SDLC). EA provides a comprehensive model of the organization for supporting each of the SDLC phases, especially for analyzing security objectives, acquiring security requirements and risk management. The adoption of EA in information system security design enables an integrated security description with analysis results at the organizational level. This view can then be used as a basis for information system security development and management in the SDLC. In particular, it facilitates the determining the cost-effectiveness of risk management and control approaches for the organization.","Enterprise architecture; Information security; Information system development life cycle; Risk management","Architecture; Cost effectiveness; Industry; Information systems; Life cycle; Risk analysis; Risk management; Analysis results; Comprehensive model; Control approach; Control mechanism; Control schemes; Cost-effective protection; Enterprise Architecture; Information security; Information system development; Information system development life cycle; Information system security; Management objectives; Management of information systems; Management tool; Organizational levels; Security objectives; Security requirements; Security of data"

One such challenge, though often overlooked, is that of the threat posed by users. Whilst a variety of methods are available to control this, none have been particularly successful. An alternative suggested in the literature is the use of organisational culture via corporate governance to improve the security behaviours of individuals (Thomson & von Solms, 2005; von Solms & von Solms, 2004; Mishra & Dhillon, 2006). At the core of these alternative theories is the assumption that culture affects information security, though no literature could be found that tests this relationship. Previous research into the effects of organisational culture on other aspects of an organisation has lead to uncertainty as to the existence of such a relationship, and therefore it needs to be evaluated before these theories can be tested or further utilised. The purpose of this study is twofold, viz, to test the relationship between organisational culture and information security behaviour, and to test the viability of using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method advocated by Chin & Newstead ( 1999) for this type of research. A model was developed to represent information security attitudes, which, combined with Hofstede's (1990) model of culture, was used to develop the survey. The model and survey were piloted via interview in the organisations. The results lead us to question the existence of a relationship between organisational culture and information security attitudes. © 2009 Greg Stephens & Kenneth J Stevens.","Information security; IT governance; Organization culture; PLS; User attitudes","Decision support systems; Information systems; Knowledge management; Surveys; Corporate culture; Corporate governance; Information systems security; IT governance; Organisational culture; Organization culture; Partial least squares; PLS; Thomson; User attitudes; Security of data"

Generally speaking, network coding is a generation of routing and it needs combine packets at the network layer to achieve the min-cut capacity of multicast. In satellite communication, the satellite is a capability-constrained relay which would serve a large number of users over a huge area. To fully exploit these characteristics of network coding and satellite communication, our framework 1) schedules and combines the packets of different flows to establish artificial multicast; and 2) uses a joint network coding and channel coding design such that the channel coding and decoding overload at the satellite is decreased or even totally removed. Under our framework, network coding in satellite communication is more powerful and more efficient than that in the traditional terrestrial communication. In particularly, two schemes are investigated under the two satellite communication modes: on-board processing mode and bent-pipe mode. The analysis and simulation show that our schemes have several advantages compared to the traditional satellite communication systems: (1) decreasing average transmission delay, (2) increasing customer capacity, and (3) enhancing information security.","","Channel coding; Combines; Communication systems; Information theory; Multicasting; Network layers; Satellites; Analysis and simulation; Information security; Joint network; Min-cut; Multicasts; Network coding; On-board processing; Satellite communication networks; Satellite communications; System framework; System levels; Terrestrial communication; Transmission delays; Satellite communication systems"

Enterprises belonging to the finance sector have more widespread use of organizational security measures, and the respondents are also more satisfied with the management engagement and the organization's performance according to the legal requirements.

However, due to the sensitive nature of these data, their protection is a critical success factor of PHR systems. It is not debatable that the misuse of medical data could have massive negative consequences for the involved parties and especially for the patient. Public knowledge of compromising medical data of a specific person may cause discrimination, stigmatization and could negatively influence the patient's working environment, social environment and even the patient's state of health. In this context it needs to be considered that the occurrence of a single case of misused patient's medical data may compromise the entire PHR system, counteracts its benefits and may even cause that it will not be used at all anymore. In this paper we will discuss security aspects that need to be taken into consideration in the context of PHR systems and provide a rigorous security analysis. Moreover, we briefly discuss new methods that can be applied to PHR systems to counteract the identified threats and thus to establish a very high level of security. These methods solely rely on technical measures and are not based on any organizational ones. © 2009 IADIS.","Enhanced security properties; Information security; Personal health record; Privacy; Security analysis","Computer science; Health; Health care; Health risks; Information systems; Security systems; Information security; Personal health record; Privacy; Security analysis; Security properties; Security of data"

We argue that the traditional orientation of these methodologies, towards the identification and assessment of technical information assets, obscures key risks associated with the cultivation and deployment of organisational knowledge. Our argument is developed through an illustrative case study in which a well-documented methodology is applied to a complex data back-up process. This process is seen to depend, in subtle and often informal ways, on knowledge to sustain operational complexity, handle exceptions and make frequent interventions. Although typical information security methodologies identify people as critical assets, we suggest a new approach might draw on more detailed accounts of individual knowledge, collective knowledge, and their relationship to organisational processes. Drawing on the knowledgemanagement literature, we suggest mechanisms to incorporate these knowledge-based considerations into the scope of information security risk methodologies. © 2009 Piya Shedden, Wally Smith, Rens Scheepers and Atif Ahmad.","Asset identification; Information security; Knowledge protection; Risk management","Decision support systems; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Risk management; Asset identification; Complex data; Critical asset; Information security risk assessment; Knowledge perspective; Knowledge protection; Operational complexity; Organisational knowledge; Security risks; Technical information; Security of data"

Given the escalating threats of malicious cyber attacks, modern enterprises employ multiple lines of defense. A comprehensive defense strategy against such attacks should include: (1) an attack detection component that determines the fact that a system is compromised, (2) an attack identification and prevention component that identifies attack packets so that one can block such packets in the future and prevent the attack from further propagation. Over the last decade, significant research time has been invested in systems that can detect cyber attacks, either statically at compile time, or dynamically at run time. However, not much effort has been spent on automated attack packet identification or attack prevention. In this paper, we present a unified solution to these problems. We implemented this solution after reverse engineering an Open Source Security Information Management (OSSIM) system, called Preventive Information Security Management (PrISM) system, which correlates input from different sensors so that the resulting product can automatically detect any cyber attack against it, and prevent attack by identifying the actual attack packet(s). PrISM was always able to detect the attacks, identify the attack packets and most often prevent attack by blocking the attacker's IP address to continue normal execution. There is no additional run-time performance overhead for attack prevention. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.","Computer Security; Information Security Management System; Intrusion Detection; Intrusion Prevention; Network Security","Crime; Industrial management; Intrusion detection; Network security; Open systems; Prisms; Reverse engineering; Security of data; Automated attacks; Automatic Detection; Information security management systems; Information security managements; Intrusion prevention; Run-time performance; Security information managements; Unauthorized access; Information management"

While there are certainly thousands of social networking websites worldwide, this paper references the three most globally visited social networking websites These are, according to Alexa.com2 on September 1, 2009, Facebook.com, visited by 23.17% of all Internet users; Blogger.com, visited by 9.25% of all Internet users; and MySpace.com, visited by 4.45% of all Internet users. In addition, we can include Twitter, a fourth such website, on the Internet today. Social networking websites present a new aspect of identity and information protection because personal information that is provided on these websites can be used as a means of social engineering against not only that person but any organization's information security with which this individual is affiliated. Account ""hijacking"" occurs when a perpetrator compromises established security measures to gain unauthorized access to the account owner's respective console; a process that can referred to as ""hacking."" An account can be ""spoofed"" by a perpetrator creating a credible online identity for the purposes of impersonation. Personnel who are discovered to have authorization within an organization may have their active social networking account hijacked or hacked; or their online identity spoofed, which then leaves their respective organization(s) vulnerable to some level of threat exposure. Because of the threat social networking websites can create, organizations must create and implement security policy which helps to prevent disclosure of any information about the organizations network, infrastructure, or Information Security through content written into a social networking website.

Their use has grown from traditional glue logic interfaces of the past to the most advanced information processing systems used by core Internet routers and high-performance computing systems. What remains common throughout this evolution is the desire to integrate more functionality in less space while using less power and at a lower cost. High-reliability system design has experienced a similar need to reduce system size, power, and cost while maintaining expected reliability. Traditionally, these systems designs have approached reliability through redundancy. This redundancy manifests itself though increased component count, logic size, system power, and cost. These requirements and attributes are shared by other system design areas, including information assurance, avionics, and industrial safety systems. This paper provides an overview of these design areas with a focus on the ability to securely partition redundant logic used in high-assurance designs by the cryptography community. It also describes a new method of collapsing the established high-reliability redundant design methodologies into a single-chip FPGA-based architecture, and presents an overview of the design flow used for development of the FPGA separation features. © 2009 IEEE.","","Cost reduction; Data processing; Design; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Military communications; Redundancy; Risk management; Systems analysis; Component count; Core Internet; Cryptography community; Design flows; FPGA design; FPGA-based architectures; Glue logic; High performance computing systems; High-reliability; High-reliability systems; Industrial safety; Information assurance; Information processing systems; Lower cost; Processing technologies; Redundant design; Single-chip; System design; System size; Systems design; Quality assurance"

We achieve this by combining the subjective and objective trust in data as a ""Figure of Merit"" value that can cross security boundaries. Our architecture captures the Data Provenance information around the 'invariant' part of a message in an XML-based SOA architecture. We also introduce the notion of 'wrappers' so that Data Provenance can be added on while minimizing impact to an existing workflow. We outline a simulation-based framework that allows us to inject faults to model various threats and attacks. We also discuss a dashboard view of a workflow that brings together the intrinsic Information Assurance attributes of a workflow as it was designed as well as its execution in a deployed system.

They will require the ability to restrict access to some class of protected information by the user position meaning, provided by some GNSS technology. Access control tokens using trusted GNSS receivers will provide the information security core for this kind of applications, including banking, enterprise and secure timestamps. In this paper a Time-Frequency (TF) signal validation algorithm is proposed as valuable tool both to define metrics to quantify the trustworthiness of the navigation signal and to provide countermeasure to the receiver functionalities. This algorithm can work as a subfunction of a signal conditioning stage placed between the Analog-to-Digital Converter and the acquisition block in an innovative secure GNSS receiver. The proposed method is based on a synthesis technique using the so called Orthogonal-Like Gabor Expansion in order to obtain an estimation of the interference to be subtracted to the input signal. Tests have been conducted using Continuous Wave (CW), chirp interference and combination of them added to GNSS signals. Baseline GPS BPSK(1), TMBOC(6,1,4/3,3), BOC(1,1) and Galileo CBOC(6,1,1/11) modulations are simulated for the scope by a software GNSS simulator. The algorithm performance are evaluated at the output of the acquisition stage by means of Receiver Operative Characteristics (ROC) curves, showing encouraging results in terms of mitigation effectiveness.","","Access control; Algorithms; Computer software; Maximum likelihood estimation; Navigation; Network security; Satellites; Signal receivers; Synthesis (chemical); Algorithm performance; Analog to digital converters; Continuous waves; Gabor expansion; GALILEO; Global navigation satellite systems; GNSS receivers; GNSS signals; Information security; Input signal; Navigation signals; Signal conditioning; Signal validation; Subfunctions; Synthesis techniques; Time frequency; Time stamps; Time-frequency approach; Global positioning system"

However, the fact that strong passwords are difficult to memorize often leads their owners to write them down on papers or even save them in a computer file. Graphical authentication has been proposed as a possible alternative solution to text-based authentication, motivated particularly by the fact that humans can remember images better than text. In recent years, many networks, computer systems and Internetbased environments try used graphical authentication technique for their user's authentication. All of graphical passwords have two different aspects which are usability and security. Unfortunately none of these algorithms were being able to cover both of these aspects at the same time.

In our solution, a end-user in Internet can perform his tasks in a VT by the control of ERBAC.

Traditional information assurance (IA) metrics quantify attributes of the underlying information system, such as the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of critical services and data, without providing mission-level perspective. Meanwhile, information attacks and defenses are not typically incorporated into Air and Missile Defense (AMD) force-level analysis. There is a demonstrated need to analyze AMD mission-level IO effects and bridge the gap between IO and force-level mission metrics. This paper describes a methodology to quantify the impact of information attacks on AMD mission performance. After a brief discussion of the systems engineering approach, we present simulation results that assess the mission-level impact of a variety of information attacks.

The purpose of the paper is to refine the availability dimension. In the context of security an object is the passive entity to be protected. ""Object"" can refer to both an information object and to a resource, e.g. the program (or service) that retrieves the information and enables access to it. Thus, we make a distinction between information and resource availability. We propose a new security model for resource availability called ""subject and object type enforcement"" (SOTE). The model can express policies for information flow between resources of different administrative domains. It controls the types of resources that are allowed to interact. The ability to express the security requirements and conditions a resource must fulfill, is also part of the model. SOTE is a variation of type enforcement. The main difference is that SOTE is a model for information flow control instead of operating system access control. Type enforcement is well suited for restricting information flows. In particular type enforcements can express intransitive (indirect) information flows. The SOTE model can express such information flow policies at a fine-grained level. This is a prerequisite for flexible and secure information flow in heterogeneous environment where the domains do not implement the same set of security policies and security levels. We also describe how multiple security models can be combined in order to express a composite security policy for information flow. We combine the classic multilevel security models (Bell-LaPadula and Biba) with the SOTE resource availability model. © 2009 IEEE.","","Computer operating systems; Military communications; Security systems; Heterogeneous environments; Information flow control; Information flow policies; Information flows; Information object; Information security; Multi-level security models; Multiple securities; Operating systems; Resource availability; Secure information flow; Security level; Security model; Security policy; Security requirements; Type enforcement; Access control"

We do. We also believe that we have a major problem because of all these security paradigms: until we find a way to identify and understand how these paradigms restrict our analyses we will never have the ability to do a good job identifying risks and threats, let alone protect ourselves from them. We also believe that the majority of people working in the security community use only one paradigm without recognizing that self-imposed constraint. The paradigm they use may change or even expand based on new data and experiences, but it still continues to limit their approaches and analyses, and therefore limit their effectiveness. At NSPW 2009 we presented a panel simulation using four analysts in order to demonstrate how security paradigms constrain perceptions and points of view, and how the combination of the different paradigms confuses the analysts' conclusions. Our panel used real-time, interactive exploration to investigate how individuals in the security community work together within their different paradigms and how they often lack awareness of their particular paradigms while working in the same way that a fish does not notice the water in which it swims.

This is caused not only by desire of management to protect sensitive information fed by growing hackers' activity but also by recent enforcement of legal requirements and industry regulations. One of the required procedures to manage information security is regular performing of IS risk assessment. Though there already are several approaches proposed to measure IS related risk, they are either inapplicable to real enterprises' IT landscapes or are of qualitative nature (based on subjective decisions of implementation team) and thus could suffer from significant degree of speculation. The purpose of this paper is to present a quantitative approach for effective and efficient assessment of IS related risks which can be easily applied to any enterprise. A key feature of proposed approach is that it does not suffer from subjective considerations and relies on statistical data. Other relevant features are: maintenance cost reduction and possibility to prioritize and compare security initiatives. © 2009 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Internet; Laws and legislation; Maintenance; Personal computing; Risk management; Information security; Key feature; Legal requirements; Maintenance cost; Manage information; Quantitative approach; Related risk; Sensitive informations; Statistical datas; Risk assessment"

Cryptography is one of the most effective ways to enhance information security. Biometrics based cryptographic key generation techniques, in which biometric features are used to generate cryptographic keys, have been developed to overcome the shortages of the traditional cryptographic methods. An essential issue of biometric cryptographic key generation is to remove the variance between biometric templates of genuine users. In previous works, error correction techniques are used to eliminate these variances. However, these techniques can only be used to remove errors in Hamming metric whereas many biometric templates are real valued vectors and cannot use Hamming distance to measure the similarity, which means that the error correction techniques can not be directly used to remove the variance between these biometric templates. In this paper, we proposed a novel biometric cryptographic framework based on city block distance. In the proposed framework, the real valued biometric feature vector is firstly quantized and then encoded into a binary string in such way that the city block distance between two feature vectors is converted to Hamming distance between two binary strings. After that, the error correction techniques are used to eliminate the errors between the strings of the genuine users. Finally, the error free string is hashed to form a cryptographic key. The experimental results conducted on face and palmprint biometrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2009 IEEE.","","Biometrics; Computer applications; Computer vision; Face recognition; Hamming distance; Technical presentations; Binary string; Biometric features; Biometric template; City-block distances; Cryptographic key; Cryptographic methods; Feature vectors; Hamming metric; Information security; Palmprints; Real valued vector; Error correction"

Today's encryption technologies can be traced back to the earliest ciphers, and have grown as a result of evolution. The first ciphers were cracked, so new, stronger ciphers emerged. Code breakers set to work on these and eventually found flaws, forcing cryptographers to invent better ciphers and so on. Hill Cipher is one of the most famous symmetric cryptosystem that can be used to protect information from unauthorized access. Hill cipher is a polygraph substitution cipher based on linear algebra. it was the first polygraph cipher which was practical to operate on more than three symbols at once, Hill Cipher has many advantages in data encryption. First, it is resistant to the frequency letter analysis. It's also very simple since it uses matrix multiplication. Finally, it has high speed and high throughput. However, noninvertible key matrix over Zm is the main disadvantage of Hill Cipher, because few of the matrices have inverses over Zm . This means that the encrypted text can't be decrypted. Moreover, Hill cipher algorithm cannot encrypt images that contain large areas of a single color. Thus, it does not hide all features of the image which reveals patterns in the plaintext. Moreover, it can be easily broken with a known plaintext attack revealing weak security. The objective of this paper is to encrypt an image using a technique different from the conventional one. In this paper, a novel encryption technique has been proposed which we name H-S-X (Hill-Shift-XOR) encryption. The scheme is relatively slow but quite reliable technique where cryptanalysis is quite difficult. It also injects more diffusion and confusion which are the two important attributes of a powerful encryption technique. A comparative study of the proposed encryption scheme and the existing Hill cipher scheme is made. The output encrypted images reveal that the proposed technique is quite reliable and robust. © 2009 IEEE.","Cryptosystem; Decryption; Encryption; Hill cipher","Matrix algebra; Optical sensors; Security of data; Comparative studies; Cryptosystems; Data encryption; Encryption schemes; Encryption technique; Encryption technologies; High throughput; Hill cipher; Image encryptions; Information security; Known-plaintext attacks; matrix; MAtrix multiplication; Plaintext; Protect information; Cryptography"

Therefore, it is important to authenticate legitimate users of a smart phone and to block imposters. In this paper, we demonstrate that keystroke dynamics of a smart phone user can be translated into a viable features' set for accurate user identification. To this end, we collect and analyze keystroke data of 25 diverse smart phone users. Based on this analysis, we select six distinguishing keystroke features that can be used for user identification. We show that these keystroke features for different users are diffused and therefore a fuzzy classifier is well-suited to cluster and classify them. We then optimize the front-end fuzzy classifier using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as back-end dynamic optimizers to adapt to variations in usage patterns. Finally, we provide a novel keystroke dynamics based PIN (Personal Identification Number) verification mode to ensure information security on smart phones. The results of our experiments show that the proposed user identification system has an average error rate of 2% after the detection mode and the error rate of rejecting legitimate users drops to zero in the PIN verification mode.

With a view to solving the problem of staff shortage, ensuring governmental information security, and promoting sustainable development of e-government, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) has organized a limited liability company - Beijing iTowNet Cyber Technology Ltd, to provide outsourcing services concerning e-government system development, operation and maintenance for the administration. With such measures as rational ownership structure, adequate management, and introduction of standards, AQSIQ has not only successfully addressed difficulties caused by lack of human, technical, and financial resources, but ensured its dominance, supervision and control over e-government outsourcing. This paper not only advocates a specific government-dominated approach for other Chinese government agencies to learn from in their e-government initiatives, but provides an innovative theoretical perspective and serves as a typical case for study for government agencies of many other developing countries.

At Esorics 2008 Dutch researchers showed that the underlying cipher Crypto-1 can be cracked in as little as 0.1 seconds if the attacker can access or eavesdrop the RF communications with the (genuine) reader. We discovered that a MiFare classic card can be cloned in a much more practical card-only scenario, where the attacker only needs to be in the proximity of the card for a number of minutes, therefore making usurpation of identity through pass cloning feasible at any moment and under any circumstances. For example, anybody sitting next to the victim on a train or on a plane is now be able to clone his/her pass. Other researchers have also (independently from us) discovered this vulnerability (Garcia et al., 2009) however our attack requires less queries to the card and does not require any precomputation. In addition, we discovered that certain versions or clones of MiFare Classic are even weaker, and can be cloned in 1 second. The main security vulnerability that we need to address with regard to MiFare Classic is not about cryptography, RFID protocols and software vulnerabilities. It is a systemic one: we need to understand how much our economy is vulnerable to sophisticated forms of electronic subversion where potentially one smart card developer can intentionally (or not), but quite easily in fact, compromise the security of governments, businesses and financial institutions worldwide.","Access control; Contactless smart cards; Covert channels; Crime science; Critical application development management; Electronic subversion; Implementation backdoors; Industrial secrets; Information assurance; London oyster card; Mifare classic; OV-chipkaart; Reverse-engineering; RFID; Secure hardware devices","Access control; Cloning; Crime; Cryptography; Electronic commerce; Network protocols; Security systems; Smart cards; Backdoors; Contactless smart card; Covert channels; Critical applications; Electronic subversion; Hardware devices; Industrial secrets; Information assurance; Network security"

In 2005, we witnessed a significant theoretical breakthrough in breaking the current cryptographic standard SHA-1. Although there is another family of standardized hash functions called SHA-2, ready to replace SHA-1 hash function, at the end of 2007, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) decided to start a 4 year world-wide development process, including a competition for the superior algorithm design, for choosing the next cryptographic hash standard SHA-3. Blue Midnight Wish is one of the proposed new designs in the SHA-3 competition that continues in the Second Round of the competition. In this paper, we describe the architecture and an FPGA implementation in several different Xilinx devices for the compression function of the Blue Midnight Wish hash function with a digest size of 256 bits (BMW-256). The main goal of this work is to implement the compression function of BMW-256 with as small as possible area.

The threats from inside an organization account for a rapidly increasing proportion of losses. The DAC (Discretionary Access Control) model, which is the primary access control mechanism in most intranets, is main responsibility for this state of affairs. Users can make a duplicate of a confidential document for which they only have read authorization. They can then grant access rights the replication to others who did not previously have authorization. This transformation of authorizations would result in the contents being divulged to unauthorized users. This paper proposes a concept of ""File View"" to solve this security problem in intranets. First, the paper proposes a hierarchy of file views which are used to structure availability of reference to database views. However there are some challenges in extending this proposal to file systems because of differences between the two. The paper proposes a framework for a file view model to solve these challenges. Finally, under three assumptions, it discusses access control and proposes read and write process algorithms for secured access in this framework. © 2009 IEEE.","Access control; Access tracing; File view; Information security; Mapping mechanism","Computer science; Information technology; Intranets; Security systems; Access control mechanism; Access rights; Database views; Discretionary access control; File systems; File view; Information security; Mapping mechanism; Security problems; State of affairs; Unauthorized users; Access control"

Furthermore they do not consider the human-behavioural aspects that determine the impact of security controls upon employees, or how security controls can be best deployed to manage insecure employee behaviour. CISOs require more information than they are currently provided with to justify their information security management decisions. Here we present a knowledge base and accompanying user interface.

This empowers CISOs to understand how different security measures impact upon each other. It also considers how human-behavioural factors can be associated with these concepts.

Text-based strong password schemes could provide with certain degree of security. However, the fact that strong passwords being difficult to memorize often leads their owners to write them down on papers or even save them in a computer file. Graphical authentication has been proposed as a possible alternative solution to text-based authentication, motivated particularly by the fact that humans can remember images better than text. In recent years, many networks, computer systems and Internet-based environments try used graphical authentication technique for their user's authentication. All of graphical passwords have two different aspects which are usability and security, unfortunately none of these algorithms were not being able to cover both of these aspects at the same time. This paper presents a review on the pure and cued recall-based algorithms in graphical password authentication. On each of these algorithms the lacks and attacks are indentified.

Biometric-based personal identification systems have proven their superior performance. These systems rely on the person physiological traits such as the iris, fingerprint or face, etc. It is worth noting that these systems are more effective than conventional personal identification systems that are based on passwords and/or smartcards. In recent years, there has been emergence in the fusion/combination of multi-biometric traits to further enhance the performance of biometric systems. The latter are commonly known as multi-biometric systems. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the fusion of iris images prior to the feature level where we model the iris textures using the Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD). Then, a systematic pattern retrieval algorithm is applied in order to improve the accuracy of overall system. Normalized iris sub-images are fused based on a specific quality measure.

The change of signal extraction quality after modulation is studied numerically, and the effects of modulation rate detuning and modulation delay time on signal extraction are analyzed too. The research results indicate that the synchronization of the original system is destroyed and the bit error rate increases by two orders of magnitude when the transmitter feedback strength is modulated. The information can not be recovered unless the receiver uses the same modulation. Furthermore, the results also show that high quality information could be obtained when rate detuning and delay time are in the range of ±5 MHz and ±0.1 times the modulation cycles, respectively.

This is due to the fact that, all other things being equal, rational attackers motivated by potential financial gains tend to direct their effort toward less-protected targets. We analyze several scenarios differing in the scope of publicly available information about target parameters and discuss conditions under which greater defenders' ability to signal their security characteristics may improve their welfare.

It needed to be isolated from the outside world and other students. The system had to be equally usable for students with limited computing and network resources. Costs had to be kept to a minimum. The Xen Worlds environment has now been used to support several courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level. This virtual environment was equally accessible to on- and off-campus students on a 24/7 basis and supported numerous assignments in support of established curriculum requirements.

MDSA automatically analyzes and documents two main compliance aspects: 1) Does the actual security match with the stated requirements? MDSA is a system and method for managing and analyzing security and information assurance requirements in reusable models, and for (mostly) automating the verification of the traceable correspondence between functional models, security models, and requirements models. 2) Do any changes impact the current accreditation? MDSA automatically identifies changes to any aspect of the ""system of systems"", and evaluates whether changes impact the current accreditation and whether manual corrections and re-accreditation are required.

The alpha-trimmed method estimates steganographic messages within images in the spatial domain and provide flexibility for classifying various steganography methods in the JPEG compression domain. For three JPEG steganography methods along with three embedding message files applied to an image data set, the proposed method results in better separability between clean and steganographic classes.

At Esorics 2008 Dutch researchers showed that the underlying cipher Crypto-1 can be cracked in as little as 0.1 seconds if the attacker can access or eavesdrop the RF communications with the (genuine) reader. We discovered that a MiFare classic card can be cloned in a much more practical card-only scenario, where the attacker only needs to be in the proximity of the card for a number of minutes, therefore making usurpation of identity through pass cloning feasible at any moment and under any circumstances.

Other researchers have also (independently from us) discovered this vulnerability (Garcia et al., 2009) however our attack requires less queries to the card and does not require any precomputation. In addition, we discovered that certain versions or clones of MiFare Classic are even weaker, and can be cloned in 1 second. The main security vulnerability that we need to address with regard to MiFare Classic is not about cryptography, RFID protocols and software vulnerabilities. It is a systemic one: we need to understand how much our economy is vulnerable to sophisticated forms of electronic subversion where potentially one smart card developer can intentionally (or not), but quite easily in fact, compromise the security of governments, businesses and financial institutions worldwide.","Access control; Contactless smart cards; Covert channels; Crime science; Critical application development management; Electronic subversion; Implementation backdoors; Industrial secrets; Information assurance; London oyster card; MiFare classic; OV-chipkaart; Reverse-engineering; RFID; Secure hardware devices","Access control; Cloning; Crime; Cryptography; Network protocols; Security systems; Smart cards; Backdoors; Contactless smart card; Covert channels; Critical applications; Electronic subversion; Hardware devices; Industrial secrets; Information assurance; Network security"

Glitch processing is hidden to conventional logic analyses and undetectable by traditional reverse engineering techniques. It enables the creation of new logic design methods that allow for an additional controllable ""glitch logic"" processing layer embedded into a conventional synchronous digital circuits as a hidden/covert information flow channel. The combination of synchronous logic with specific glitch logic design acting as an additional computing channel reduces the number of equivalent logic designs resulting from synthesis, thus implicitly reducing the possibility of modification and/or tampering with the design. The hidden information channel produced by the glitch logic can be used: 1) for covert computing/communication, 2) to prevent reverse engineering, tampering, and alteration of design, and 3) to act as a channel for information infiltration/exfiltration and propagation of viruses/spyware/Trojan horses. © 2009 IEEE.","Anti-tamper; Hardware vulnerabilities; Information exfiltration; Protection to reverse engineering; Stego-design; Trusted design","Data processing; Digital integrated circuits; Intelligent systems; Logic design; Reengineering; Reverse engineering; Switching circuits; Anti-tamper; Digital system; Exfiltration; Hidden information; Information flows; Information processing; Information security; Logic analysis; Potential benefits; Processing layer; Protection to reverse engineering; Stego-design; Logic circuits"

A naive implementation of tags simply adds a tag field to every byte of the cache and the memory. Such technique, however, results in a huge hardware overhead. This paper proposes a low-overhead tagged architecture. We achieve our goal by exploiting some properties of tag, the non-uniformity and the locality of reference. Our design includes a use of uniquely designed multi-level table and various cache-like structures, all contributing to exploit these properties.

Unlike cryptography that the encrypted information represents like noisy patterns, by using watermarking, the watermarked contents look almost identical to its original counterpart, while it still retains the capability to counteract intentional signal processing by others and keeps the existence of the hidden watermark. From this point of view, watermarking is suitable for covert communication since it tends not to cause the suspicion by others. Besides, there must be requirements to keep both the embedded watermark alive and the watermarked contents acceptable. In this paper, we make use of a technique for swarm intelligence, named bacterial foraging, for obtaining an optimized watermarking algorithm with a properly designed fitness function comprising the possible requirements including the watermarked image quality and the capability for the existence of extracted watermark.

Our experiment involved cellular social-networks with four types of data error: missing links, missing actors, extra links, and extra actors. We provide statistical results for top threat identification from the perspective of four traditional measures of network centrality: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. The results from our experiment provide a statistical estimate of the accuracy of the top-1 and top-3 actors as indicated by the observed data. Using these statistics a quantitative indication of reliability can be provided along with defence intelligence estimates of covert-organization leadership derived from relational network data. We provide lookup tables for the specific situations created for this experiment, from which other conditions may be loosely estimated. This work has highly practical implications for operational analysts and consumers of such analyses, particularly in the terrorist network and drug-trafficking domains.

Finally, the mobile agent can complete the tasks which are assigned by the users. These characteristics help shaping the mobile agent becomes the most suitable for e-commerce applications. It is always risky to transfer confidential information over an open Internet environment. When the mobile agent roams among the hosts over the internet or exchanges information with others, the users would have concerns whether the mobile agent could be attacked by manipulated hosts or the confidential information that are carried could be stolen and tampered by the others.

To build an automatic lip-reading system, one key issue is how to locate the lip region, particularly under the changing illumination condition. Empirical studies have shown that the recognition rate of a lip-reading system greatly relies on the accuracy of the lip localization. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, lip localization under face illumination with shadow consideration has not been well solved yet. Moreover, this problem is also one of the major obstacles to keeping an automatic lip-reading system from the practical applications. This paper therefore concentrates on this problem and proposes a new approach to obtain the minimum enclosing rectangle surround of a mouth automatically based upon the transformed gray-level image. In this approach, a pre-processing is firstly made to reduce the interference caused by shadow and enhance the boundary region of lip, through which the left and right mouth corners are estimated. Then, by building a binary sequence based on the gray-level values along with the vertical midline of mouth, the top and bottom crucial points can be estimated. Experiments show the promising result of the proposed approach in comparison with the existing methods. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Such computations use confidential data of the involved banks to compute the result. As the concerned data is private for the owning organization, its security is prime concern. Privacy preservation concern rises as no party can be trusted enough to know all the inputs of computation. In this paper we have proposed a scalable and efficient protocol to perform secure multi-party computations on encrypted data. The process involves encrypting data in a manner that it does not affect the result of the computation. Virtual parties are created by all organizations and encrypted data is distributed among them. Modifier tokens are generated along encryption which are assigned to virtual parties, and finally used in the computation. The computation function uses the acquired data and modifier tokens to compute result. As the data involved in computation was encrypted, without revealing the data right result can be computed and privacy of the parties is maintained. The protocol is highly efficient in conducting banking computations. We have analyzed the security and complexity of protocol and shown how zero hacking security can be achieved. Also we have analyzed the performance through various tests. ©2009 IEEE.","Communication and information security; Secure multi-party computation","Computer crime; Cryptography; Internet; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Personal computing; Computation function; Confidential data; Encrypted data; Information security; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Secure multi-party computation; Security analysis; Network security"

Basically, the RSA algorithm entails a modular exponentiation operation on large integers, which is considerably time-consuming to implement. Since ancient time, number theory has been an important study subject and modular arithmetic has also been widely used in cryptography. The Wilson's primality test method is one of the most well-known deterministic prime number test methods. It states that n is a prime number if and only if (n-1)!≡--1mod n . In this paper, we compare two primality test algorithms for implementing the Wilson's method, which need 1 2*[(n-1/2)!] and n(log2 n)2 multiplications, respectively. However, by using the proposed reduction algorithm, only n+1/2 *[1-(1/2)k]+1 multiplications are needed for the Wilson's primality test method, where K=[log2n-1/2] and the ""n"" means a prime number. The proposed computational reduction method can efficiently perform Wilson's deterministic primality test, and it is faster than other proposed methods. By using the proposed method, it can not only reduce the overall computational complexity of the original Wilson's primality test method but also reduce the computational space.","Cryptography; Information security; Modular arithmetic; Number theory; Primality test","Computational complexity; Computational efficiency; Cryptography; Network security; Number theory; Computational reduction; Cryptosystems; Information security; Modular arithmetic; Modular Exponentiation; Primality test; Primality tests; Prime number; Reduction algorithms; RSA algorithms; Test method; Testing"

Two different research models are proposed for an employee's individual based beliefs and organization based beliefs. An employee's attitude is traced to its underlying foundational beliefs in each model, namely, benefit of compliance, cost of non-compliance, and cost of compliance, which are beliefs that represent the perceived effects of compliance or non-compliance. It is also postulated that these beliefs along with an employee's attitude are affected by her Information Security Awareness (ISA). Besides the structural model testing of individual and organizational models of compliance, the moderating role of an employee's work experience is investigated. Our results show that, while individual benefit of compliance and cost of compliance are not significant in the low experience group, all individual based beliefs are significant in the high experience group. Similarly, organizational benefit of compliance is not significant in the low experience group, while all organization based beliefs are significant in the high experience group.

Nevertheless, these structures require either large amount of mobile codes or heavy computation loads. In this paper, a lightweight key management method for hierarchical access control in mobile agent environments is proposed.

In this paper, we present the architecture, the main functionalities and the dependability related issues of a security system specifically tailored to metro railways. Heterogeneous intrusion detection, access control, intelligent video-surveillance and sound detection devices are integrated in a cohesive Security Management System (SMS). In case of emergencies, the procedural actions required to the operators involved are orchestrated by the SMS. Redundancy both in sensor dislocation and hardware apparels (e.g. by local or geographical clustering) improve detection reliability, through alarm correlation, and overall system resiliency against both random and malicious threats. Video-analytics is essential, since a small number of operators would be unable to visually control a large number of cameras. Therefore, the visualization of video streams is activated automatically when an alarm is generated by smart-cameras or other sensors, according to an event-driven approach. The system is able to protect stations (accesses, technical rooms, platforms, etc.), tunnels (portals, ventilation shafts, etc.), trains and depots. Presently, the system is being installed in the Metrocampania underground regional railway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first subway security system featuring artificial intelligence algorithms both for video and audio surveillance. The security system is highly heterogeneous in terms not only of detection technologies but also of embedded computing power and communication facilities. In fact, sensors can differ in their inner hardware-software architecture and thus in the capacity of providing information security and dependability. The focus of this paper is on the development of novel solutions to achieve a measurable level of dependability for the security system in order to fulfill the requirements of the specific application. © 2009 IEEE.","Critical infrastructure protection; Detection reliability; Physical security; Smart surveillance; System dependability","Access control; Artificial intelligence; Cameras; Intrusion detection; Light rail transit; Locomotives; Mass transportation; Mathematical operators; Monitoring; Network security; Public works; Quality assurance; Railroad cars; Railroads; Redundancy; Sensors; Software architecture; Subways; Alarm correlation; Audio surveillance; Communication facilities; Criminal acts; Critical infrastructure protection; Detection technology; Embedded computing; Event-driven approach; Geographical clustering; Information security; Integrated surveillance systems; Intelligent video; Mass transit systems; Novel solutions; Physical security; Security management systems; Smart surveillance systems; Sound detection; Ventilation shafts; Video streams; Security systems"

With the continuous development of network technology, information security has become a major concern for the cyber system research. In the modern net-centric and tactical warfare networks, the situation is more critical to provide real-time protection for the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of the networked information. To this end, in this work we propose to explore the learning capabilities of SOM, and integrate it with KDE for the network intrusion detection. KDE is used to estimate the distributions of the observed random variables that describe the network system and determine whether the network traffic is normal or abnormal. Meanwhile, the learning and clustering capabilities of SOM are employed to obtain well-defined data clusters to reduce the computational cost of the KDE. The principle of learning in SOM is to self-organize the network of neurons to seek similar properties for certain input patterns. Therefore, SOM can form an approximation of the distribution of input space in a compact fashion, reduce the number of terms in a kernel density estimator, and thus improve the efficiency for the intrusion detection. We test the proposed algorithm over the real-world data sets obtained from the Integrated Network Based Ohio University's Network Detective Service (INBOUNDS) system to show the effectiveness and efficiency of this method. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Anomaly-based network intrusion detection (ABNID); Kernel density estimation (KDE); Machine learning; Self-organizing map (SOM)","Algorithms; Computational efficiency; Conformal mapping; Cost reduction; Education; Estimation; Internet; Intrusion detection; Random processes; Random variables; Robot learning; Strength of materials; Abnormal behavior; Computational costs; Cyber systems; Data clusters; Information security; Input patterns; Input space; Integrated networks; Kernel density estimation; Kernel density estimators; Learning capabilities; Machine-learning; Net-centric; Network intrusion detection; Network systems; Network technologies; Network traffic; Ohio University; Real world data; Real-time protection; Self-organize; Sensor networks"

Without any increase of the computational complexity, the MPFRFT-based image encryption method owns more secret keys than the encryption methods operated by other fractional Fourier transforms. On the other hand, even though the order of the fractional Fourier transform which is treated as a secret key is known, one still can't decrypt the image correctly, so do the four free parameters.

It makes use of channel randomness, reciprocity, and fast decorrelation in space to secure OFDM with low overheads on encryption, decryption, and key distribution. These properties make it a good alternative to traditional software-based information security algorithms in systems where the costs associated with such algorithms are an implementation obstacle. A necessary and sufficient condition for achieving information theoretic security in accordance with channel and system parameters is derived. Security by complexity is assessed for cases where the condition for information theoretic security is not satisfied. In addition, practical means for implementing the method are derived including generating robust joint constellations, decoding data with low complexity, and mitigating the effects of imperfections due to mobility, power control errors, and synchronization errors.","","Decoding; Errors; Human computer interaction; Information theory; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Public key cryptography; Time varying networks; Time varying systems; Decorrelations; Information security; Information-theoretic security; Joint decoding; Key distribution; Low complexity; Low overhead; Power control error; Signal constellation; Software-based; Sub-carriers; Subcarrier; Sufficient conditions; Superposition modulation; Synchronization error; Time varying channel; Network security"

Recent research conducted by QinetiQ has demonstrated that the security system, however sophisticated the screening technology, can be significantly influenced by the attitudes and behaviour of personnel and the supporting security policies. Culture is essentially a ""set of common understandings, expressed in language"" [1], or ""shared patterns of meaning"" [2], or ""shared values and beliefs that interact with an organisation's structures and control systems to produce behavioural norms"" [3]. Culture is of interest in a security context if it can be proven to affect security outcomes. Substantial evidence supports this notion, for example Kotter and Heskett [4] found that culture was a predictor of business outcomes such as revenue and workforce growth. Although specific research on security culture has been limited, it has been suggested that relationships exist between security culture and organisational security metrics (for example security breaches). Understanding and then enhancing the security culture within organisations where security is a critical success factor is likely to lead to those organisations being better able to achieve their primary goals and maintain their reputation. QinetiQ was commissioned to conduct research to explore and define the notion of security culture in a range of organisations. These organisations were grouped in terms of having common, primary threats: those providing safety critical products or services (for example energy, chemical, food, water); those dealing with people and crowded places (for example airports and transport networks); and those at risk of fraud, theft, or espionage (for example finance). A literature review revealed that: there is no accepted, practical definition of security culture; there is no accepted way of measuring security culture that can be used outside narrow domains (for example the nuclear industry) to compare culture across organisations; research into how security culture can be engendered and enhanced is narrowly focused on specific aspects of culture; and there is a lack of research relating security culture to organisational performance. Qualitative research was conducted to explore what security culture means. Three main techniques were used in the gathering of qualitative data. These were: the Twenty Statements Test (TST) [5], repertory grids technique [6], and critical incidents technique [7]. The analysis of the data gathered by these techniques yielded nine categories or themes relating to security culture. The themes, listed below, could support the creation of an item bank for the development and trialling of the security culture audit tool. The themes demonstrate the content of security culture: what is contained within it. The emergent themes are: • External Influences; • Human Resource Activities; • Impact on Business; • Infrastructure; • Information Security; • Management; • Organisational Staff; • Physical Security; • Working with External Others. As a result of this work a working definition of security culture has been derived, and is stated as: ""Security culture is indicated in the assumptions, values, attitudes and beliefs, held by members of an organisation, and behaviours they perform, which could potentially impact on the security of that organisation, and that may, or may not, have an explicit, known, link to that impact"". This paper will suggest implications of these findings for Aviation Security. Some aspects of an organisation's security culture have evolved as a logical response to security threats, and are espoused by the management of the organisation. These manifest themselves in the security practices and policies of the organisation, the level of compliance with, and understanding of, those practices and policies, and the acknowledgement and awareness of security threats to the organisation.

These schemes require organizations to identify their information assets, find out potential incidents to those assets, and assess expected losses associated with those incidents. While asset value is important in determining loss expectancies for associated incidents, the accuracy of asset valuation is crucial. Although numerous guidelines exist regarding how best to evaluate asset value, current risk assessment schemes generally overlook how to validate assessments of asset value. Consequently, this work presents a process-oriented approach that organizations can employ to validate and adjust asset value. The approach presented in this study can help organizations represent their business processes and information assets used in those processes using flowcharts, and also mark dependencies among assets based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements on flowcharts. Organizations can use the markings of dependencies to validate and correct results associated with asset valuation. If organizations can more accurately evaluate asset value, they can improve the effectiveness of their risk assessment. Therefore, the approach presented in this study can hopefully help improve organizational information security © 2009 IEEE.","","Flowcharting; Network security; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Soil structure interactions; Asset valuation; Asset value; Business Process; Information assets; Information security; Organizational information; Potential incidents; Process-oriented approaches; Risk assessment"

The former belongs to robust lossy watermarking, which embedded in NROI by wavelet provides a good way for protecting the focus area (ROI) of images, and introduction of block-mean approach a good scheme to enhance the anti-attack capability; the latter belongs to fragile lossless watermarking, which has the performance of simple implementation and can realize tamper localization effectively, and the pseudo-random matrix enhances the correlation and security between pixels.

The first six ones build professional knowledge of information asset to ontology according to OWL, RDF and technique of semantic web combined with the analyzing of information asset. The last two not only combine regulations in SWRL and utilize information-asset knowledgebase system built by Protégé, but also integrate database and import inference engine to implement. The methodology can assist auditors to know the status of information asset well at any moment. It can also support auditors to discover the problems apropos in efficiency. In addition to detecting harmful individual of information asset, it also can verify that all information assets are authorized and dealt with appropriately. Besides, it can make professional knowledge of this domain to reach the goal of share and reuse through the concept and technique of semantic web. © 2009 IEEE.","Information asset; Information security; Knowledge base; Ontology","Combines; Competition; International trade; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Laws and legislation; Multimedia signal processing; Network security; Ontology; Professional aspects; Semantic Web; Semantics; Signal processing; World Wide Web; Information assets; Information security; Knowledge base; Professional knowledge; Information dissemination"

By using watermarking, the watermark bits are hidden into the multimedia content with the designed algorithm. And the watermarked contents, or the watermarked image in this paper, look almost identical to its original counterpart, while it still retains the capability to counteract intentional signal processing by others and keeps the existence of the hidden watermark. We employ the concept of sub-sampling and make use of the frequency coefficient similarities between the subimages for effectively embedding the watermark. In addition, there must be requirements to keep both the embedded watermark alive and the watermarked contents acceptable. Here we make use of an optimization technique, called bacterial foraging, for obtaining an optimized watermarking algorithm with a properly designed fitness function comprising the possible requirements including the watermarked image quality and the capability for the existence of extracted watermark. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with the combination of sub-sampling and bacterial foraging. © 2009 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Bacteriology; Copyrights; Digital watermarking; Function evaluation; Image quality; Multimedia signal processing; Signal processing; Bacterial foraging; Copyright protections; Covert communications; Embedded watermarks; Fitness functions; Frequency coefficient; Hidden watermarks; Information security; Multimedia contents; Optimization techniques; Research fields; Simulation result; Sub-sampling; Subimages; Watermark bits; Watermarked images; Watermarking algorithms; Watermarking"

Due to the increasing sophistication of attacking techniques and automated attacking tools, it is necessary for large scale information to combine multiple and heterogeneous security mechanisms' collaboration to discover and defend various distributed and coordinated attacks. In order to allow for a coordinated Integration of existing information security technologies, a fusing multi-defense technology optimization model is proposed, which takes into account not only the security aspect but also its impact on the performance, usability, and cost. The relative preference among the objectives can be adjusted by varying the weights associated with each parameter of mathematic model. The model is illustrated and confirmed by applying it to a typical example problem in the information sharing field. This method can improve the scalability, accuracy and capability by adopting multi defense technology. © 2009 IEEE.","Information security; Integration model; Optimal security set; Performance measure","Mathematical models; Multimedia systems; Optimization; Coordinated attack; Defense technologies; Information security; Information security technologies; Information sharing; Integration models; Mathematic model; Optimal integration model; Optimal security; Performance measure; Security mechanism; Network security"

One of the most important issues in health-related information systems is high information security and stringent access control for patient's health data to protect the patient's privacy and to prevent the use of data harmfully or illegally. Carrying health records with a patient, for example in a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a mobile phone, could provide greater control of the patient's health data and privacy. It can also facilitate exchanging this health data with health care workers at the point of care and only to the level desired. In this paper, we propose a portable personal electronic health record architecture which natively supports a greater level of privacy using an extended digital certificatebased approach. Other challenges to security accompanying a portable device-based approach are also considered. ©2009 IEEE.","Electronic personal health records; Portable health records; Role-based access control","Access control; Data privacy; Health care; Information systems; Medical computing; Network security; Personal digital assistants; Records management; Security systems; Telecommunication equipment; Certificate-based; Clinical information system; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health data; Health records; Healthcare services; Information security; Personal health record; Point of care; Portable device; Role-based; Role-based Access Control; Health"

But, Information Security Managers of academic campuses are yet to pay similar attention to this challenge. As direct financial losses resulting due to this are not of similar magnitude. However, universities and colleges have sensitive academic and personal records. Also, many institutes are engaged in advanced research and creating valuable intellectual property, which need to be protected. Monitoring insider threats in academic campuses is particularly difficult because of complexity of networks, diverse mix of systems and resistance for strict restrictions. Major challenges include, less disciplined users compared to industry users, sharing of terminals, inadequate budgets and fast turnover of student population. There are almost thirty percent new enrollments every year. Existing monitoring and control methods are inadequate for two reasons: they are able to trace source IP addresses but fail to identify the precise user, performing suspicious or non-sanctioned activities. Secondly, they do not provide real-time actions, as user profile is not known. Given these security challenges and the complexity of protecting information assets across diverse servers, applications, and heterogeneous environment, a new approach is proposed. Identity issue is addressed by capturing detailed network user actions across most major applications and correlating it with directory context to track and enforce institutional policies. This is different from existing approaches, where a traffic oriented view of user activity is provided. The proposed approach provides a low cost and quickly deployable solution as no network changes are required. Proposed real-time tracking and alerting mechanism ensures early warning and also proactively stops transactions in progress without degrading performance. It also facilitates audit automation using rule engine, which is constantly updated by an Intelligent Rule Builder.
