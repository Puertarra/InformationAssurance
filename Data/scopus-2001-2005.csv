Part 1, (ISS, January/February 2001) discussed the process of designing and developing a security awareness program. The security awareness program should be the first step in the information system security awareness and training program. In conjunction with the awareness program, the information security professional should design a training program. When designing and developing an information technology (IT) security training program, there is a wide range of options that are based on specific job requirements and the daily management, operation, and protection of the information system. This article describes a framework to help develop an information system security training program that will match your organization's needs. © 2001 Taylor & Francis.","",""

Where we would, historically, rarely work on even two standards in parallel, we now must work on a dozen. Prior to 1986, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) did not exist. Today, we have thousands of Requests for Comment (RFC) documents, many of which are on the IETF standards track.

The Open Platform (OP) Card Specification [2] provides a robust specification for that installer. It identifies the oncard security features necessary to safeguard the various actors that are involved in a smart card system, including card issuers, application providers as well as cardholders. Such is the nature of information security these days it is necessary to demonstrate the trustworthiness of the OP approach. The Common Criteria (ISO 15408:1999) [3] presents an obvious course of action. A “Protection Profile”, termed OP3 [4] has therefore been produced in order to ensure the benefit of Common Criteria evaluation of the OP installer, and by virtue of specifying the security requirements of the underlying operating system and integrated circuitry, of Java CardTMand the chipcard platform itself. Evaluation will demonstrate that the OP security requirements are correctly implemented and cannot be bypassed, deactivated, corrupted or otherwise circumvented – at least to a given level of confidence (an EAL in Common Criteria terms). This is an amazingly useful first step. However, there are important off-card assets that the smart card does not protect. Common Criteria evaluation does nothing to mitigate the risks to those assets. A Common Criteria evaluation will make assumptions about the environment of the target of evaluation. Evaluation does nothing to validate those assumptions. The assumptions usually concern the compromise of security data held off-card. It therefore makes little sense to rely just on the CC evaluation of just the smart card in order to establish and maintain the security of the overall system. Other steps are necessary. The paper describes what is being done to progress the Common Criteria evaluation of OP and what else is necessary to ensure confidence in the security of the overall system. Researches indicate that Common Criteria evaluation at a modest level of evaluation (e.g. EAL 4) together with an “Information Security Management System” (ISMS), as specified in BS 7799:1999 Part 2 [5] –particularly to address the off-card security issues–reduces the need for smart card evaluation at higher EALs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.","","Cryptography; Information management; Java programming language; Smart cards; Specifications; Application providers; Course of action; Information security management systems; Integrated circuitry; Protection profile; Runtime environments; Security features; Security requirements; Network security"

A number of technological measures already exist to provide security in the online world, such as encryption, electronic signatures and privacy enhancing technologies. However, one often encounters a number of legal constraints to the use of these measures through, for example, restrictions on the export and use of cryptography, difficulties and doubts of the legal recognition of electronic signatures, and different national rules on certification services. If electronic commerce is to grow, there is need for more international cooperation as well as mutual recognition of, and more liberalisation of, such regulations.

Middleware security needs such security attributes in order to be able to express middleware layer security policies. Our analysis points out that, whilst there is no information available on the ORB layer to describe the caller and target, it is possible in practice to use descriptors from other layers. In CORBA security, the mechanism-specific identifiers on the caller side and the information from the object reference on the target side turn out to be most appropriate and trustworthy for describing caller and target application objects at the right granularity. As a proof of concept we mention our MICOSec CORBA security implementation which demonstrates the feasibility of our approach.

The security assessment instrument includes a Vulnerability Matrix (VMatrix) with platform/application, and signature fields in a database. The information in the VMatrix has become the basis for the Database of Vulnerabilities, Exploits, and Signatures (DOVES) at UC Davis. The instrument also includes a set of Security Assessment Tools (SAT), including the development of a property-based testing tool by UC Davis, to slice software code looking for specific vulnerability properties. A third component of the research is an investigation into the verification of software designs for compliance to security properties. This is based on innovative model checking approaches that will facilitate the development and verification of software security models. © 2001 IEEE.","Application software; Data security; Databases; Information security; Instruments; National security; Paper technology; Programming; Software maintenance; Software tools","Application programs; Compliance control; Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Computer software maintenance; Database systems; Formal methods; Instrument testing; Instruments; Life cycle; Maintenance; Mathematical programming; Model checking; NASA; National security; Risk assessment; Security of data; Software design; Software engineering; Software testing; Verification; Assessment instruments; California Institute of Technology; Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Paper technology; Property based testing; Software development and maintenances; University of California; Verification of softwares; Network security"

The route taken by the message, the originator of the message, and the recipient of the message (as well as additional recipients in this case) are clearly shown in the header. However, the header information goes far beyond “from” and “to” information. It includes software version and release-level information for each product in the traced route. It includes time and date stamps and message identifiers (sufficient information to obtain a copy of the message from an intervening node if the store-and-forward node keeps the copy long enough). It includes the subject line and a unique message identifier that incorporates the sender’s email address. Finally, it includes a user identifier (UIDL) that provides a locally unique identifier for the message that may aid in tracing the message within the system of origin. Of course, a knowledgeable perpetrator can easily forge or alter these headers, and successful delivery of the message does not require most of the fields. However, many criminals use technologies they do not understand, leaving evidence they did not know they were leaving.

IDS traditionally suffer from an inability to detect an attack that is built from a sequence of valid network activity. For this reason it is important to develop a system capable of analyzing the global nature of the network activity. One such system is GrIDS-a graph based intrusion detection system for large networks, being developed at the University of California, Davis, California. This system constructs graphs based on the network activity and then detects attacks based on an analysis of the characteristics of these graphs. One of the bottlenecks in this process is the inability to efficiently compare characteristics of very large networks. This often becomes necessary because the increasing complex nature of network traffic generates graphs with multiple nodes and edges. We propose using a new result on subgraph isomorphism due to Eppstein (see Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications, vol.3, no.3, p.1-27, 1999) to maximize the efficiency of this analysis. This provides the IDS with the ability to analyze traffic on a broader level and thus increases the overall performance of the system. © 2001 IEEE.","Authorization; Computer industry; Computer network reliability; Explosives; Information security; Intelligent networks; Internet; Intrusion detection; Performance analysis; Telecommunication traffic","Complex networks; Computer crime; Explosives; Explosives detection; Graphic methods; Intelligent networks; Internet; Mercury (metal); Reliability analysis; Security of data; Telecommunication industry; Telecommunication traffic; Authorization; Computer industry; Computer network reliability; Graphical technique; Intrusion Detection Systems; Performance analysis; Subgraph isomorphism; University of California; Intrusion detection"

As a result, it is hard to understand the essential structures of those protocols and each protocol must be evaluated and implemented independently. To solve these problems, we propose an anonymous communication model that can represent a wide variety of anonymous protocols. In our model, we introduce agents that work in cooperation to realize anonymous communication. This modeling is based on the observation that most of practical anonymous protocols have much commonality in that they have several relay nodes en route from the sender to the receiver to provide anonymity. On our model, such agents' behaviors are expressed in a small set of primitive functions. Using these primitive functions, the essential structures of anonymous communication protocols can be described clearly. © 2001 IEEE.","Information science; Information security; Information technology; Protocols; Relays; Research and development","Computational methods; Information science; Information technology; Network protocols; Security of data; Agent-based model; Anonymous communication; Anonymous protocol; En-route; Primitive function; Relay node; Relays; Research and development; Autonomous agents"

While virtually all previous authentication watermarking schemes introduced some small amount of non-invertible distortion in the image, the new methods are invertible in the sense that, if the image is deemed authentic, the distortion due to authentication can be completely removed to obtain the original image data. The first technique is based on lossless compression of biased bit-streams derived from the quantized JPEG coefficients. The second technique modifies the quantization matrix to enable lossless embedding of one bit per DCT coefficient. Both techniques are fast and can be used for general distortion-free (invertible) data embedding. The new methods provide new information assurance tools for integrity protection of sensitive imagery, such as medical images or high-importance military images viewed under non-standard conditions when usual criteria for visibility do not apply. © 2001 IEEE.","","Authentication; Medical imaging; Military photography; Watermarking; Authentication watermarking; DCT coefficients; Information assurance; Integrity protection; Lossless compression; Quantization matrix; Standard conditions; Watermarking methods; Image watermarking"

It is based on the idea that much behavior on the network appears as sequences of activities, according to the sequence patterns we computed, we can construct the intrusion rule base and legal action rule base, then we can detect known and novel intrusion activities by rule matching. In addition, when the system is running, we use an incremental sequence pattern mining algorithm to complement the rule library in order to avoid re-executing the algorithm on the entire dataset, thereby reducing execution time. The experimental results indicate that this algorithm is efficient enough to meet the needs for active detection of intrusion.

They became aware that nowadays students usually have a long experience of computer use before they start their university studies. If students are to become responsible computer users they must learn about computer security in the compulsory school system. SUSEC has conducted a preliminary study of the situation and developed a questionnaire about the degree of technology and security in connection with the introduction of computer use in the school system. It found that most schools give some form of computer use education. Many schools state that they have an IT-strategy and that they have appointed staff responsible for security matters but in most cases this does not create any resulting courses for the pupils.

The second step was to specify and evaluate common security technologies applied in healthcare information systems pointing out gaps and efficient solutions, whereas the third was to draw conclusions for the present conditions and identify the future trends of healthcare information security. A number of EU RTD Projects were selected, categorised, analysed and comparatively evaluated in terms of security. The technical focus was on key security technologies, like Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) based on Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) in conjunction with other state-of-the-art security components (programming tools, data representation formats, security standards & protocols, security policies and risk assessment techniques).

Digital television (d-TV) uses high-bandwidth connections to provide on-demand pay-per-view multimedia content and value-added services, such as electronic shopping. Mobile electronic commerce (m-Commerce) extends these new business models into a wireless world. Both technologies share similar requirements in terms of information security, as they require proper authentication, message integrity and confidentiality of business contracts and personal preferences. This paper presents protocols and infrastructure considerations to deal with the specific challenges arising from these applications: limited computational power, simple transfer of device ownership and transfer of access privileges between devices. The security requirements of future-generation electronic commerce applications are surveyed and protocols for use with these applications are discussed. In this context, trust-based authentication mechanisms (relying on recommendations and revocations) are adopted, in order to avoid static hierarchies and the need for central certification authorities. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.","","Authentication; Commerce; Digital television; Electronic commerce; Multimedia services; Security of data; Television broadcasting; Wireless telecommunication systems; Authentication mechanisms; Central certification; Computational power; Electronic commerce applications; Information devices; Network communications; New business models; Security requirements; Mobile commerce"

In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of C-ISCAP, which is IPsec based Internet information security system and also we will show the data of performance measurement.","IPsec; Security; Security Association; Security Policy","Information systems; Internet; Security of data; Security systems; Web services; Authentication services; Design and implementations; IPsec; Performance measurements; Secure connectivities; Security; Security association; Security policy; Internet protocols"

DAIS is a COTS-DBMS-specific implementation of a general isolation algorithm that was developed previously (P. Liu et al., 2000). The design of the first DAIS prototype, which is for Oracle Server 8.1.6, is discussed. DAIS uses triggers and transaction profiles to keep track of the items read and written by transactions, isolates attacks by rewriting user SQL statements, and is transparent to end users. The DAIS design is very general. In addition to Oracle, it can be easily adapted to support many other database application platforms such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, and Informix. © 2001 IEEE.","Data security; Database systems; Face detection; Information security; Information systems; Intrusion detection; Protection; Prototypes; Real time systems; Transaction databases","Database systems; Face recognition; Information systems; Interactive computer systems; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Security of data; Security systems; Windows operating system; Database applications; Database security; Isolation systems; Malicious transaction; Microsoft SQL Server; Protection; Prototypes; Transaction database; Real time systems"

The authors have developed accuracy theory of electrical machines which is a methodological basis of quality management of electrotechnical production. The peculiarity of electrical machines compared with the other units lies in the fact that one should provide functional interchangeability according to electrical, mechanical and thermal parameters. This fact significantly complicates an information system. The purpose of the given investigation is the development of a quality shaping model in the manufacturing of induction motors which is the basis for a quality management information system. Practical implementation of this model has been made for induction motors which are the most widespread electrical machines. The developed model is adequate and allows to calculate spread and tolerances of quality indices, to evaluate technological errors value during manufacturing. Mathematical simulation of larger rating induction motors has been carried out. As a result information system data for quality management during manufacturing have been obtained.

I will concentrate on the concept of secrecy, also known as confidentiality, and in particular on the notion of non-interference. Non-interference seeks to characterise the absence of information flows through a system and, as such, is a fundamental concept in information security. A central thesis of these lectures is that, viewed from a process algebraic point of view, the problem of characterising non-interference is essentially equivalent to that of characterising the equivalence of processes. The latter is itself a fundamental and delicate question at the heart of process algebra and indeed theoretical computer science: the semantics of a process is intimately linked to the question of which processes should be regarded as equivalent. We start, by way of motivation and to set the context, with a brief historical background. A much fuller exposition of security policies in the wider sense, embracing properties other than secrecy, can be found in the chapter by Pierangela Samarati in this volume. We then cover some elements of process algebra, in particular CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes), that we need and present a formulation of non-interference, along with some more operational presentations of process algebra, including the idea of bi-simulation. I argue that the classical notion of unwinding found in the security literature is really just bisimulation in another guise. Finally, I propose some generalisations of the process algebraic formulations designed to encompass a richer class of policies and examples. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.","","Computer operating procedures; Security of data; Security systems; Semantics; Algebraic approaches; Communicating sequential process; Fundamental concepts; Historical background; Information flows; Process algebras; Security properties; Theoretical computer science; Algebra"

The first formal experiment of the AIA program, termed AIA Experiment 001, explored the relationship between the effectiveness of responses to scripted security attacks and the speed of those responses. This paper discusses how the CIRCA (Cooperative Intelligent Real-Time Control Architecture) system for automatic controller synthesis can reason about the problem explored in AIA Experiment 001, can automatically predict the results of the experiment, and can exploit those predictions itself. By modeling the individual steps of the attack and the potential response actions, CIRCA can explicitly compute the response-time threshold distinguishing effective responses from ineffective responses. In fact, CIRCA can use this knowledge to build a reactive security controller that guarantees to respond quickly enough to prevent the attacker from succeeding. To show how CIRCA does this reasoning, we begin with a brief review of Experiment 001 and its results, then provide a short review of how CIRCA works. We then illustrate how CIRCA models the experiment and builds a controller that will always defeat the attack. The intent is to clearly illustrate CIRCA's reasoning processes that build guaranteed controllers, and how they relate to information assurance. © 2001 IEEE.","","Control system synthesis; Real time control; Security of data; Security systems; Automatic controllers; Automatic systems; Formal Experiments; High speed computers; Information assurance; Intelligent real time control; Potential response; Reasoning process; Controllers"

Although there are quite a large number of events that are prior to an attack (e.g. suspicious log-ons, start of processes, addition of new files, sudden shifts in traffic, etc.), in this work we depend solely on information from MIB (management information base) traffic variables collected from the systems participating in the attack. Three types of DDoS attacks were effected on a research test bed, and MIB variables were recorded. Using these datasets, we show how there are indeed MIB-based precursors of DDoS attacks that render it possible to detect them before the target is shut down. Most importantly, we describe how the relevant MIB variables at the attacker can be extracted automatically using statistical tests for causality. It is shown that statistical tests applied in the time series of MIB traffic at the target and the attacker are effective in extracting the correct variables for monitoring in the attacker machine. Following the extraction of these key variables at the attacker, it is shown that an anomaly detection scheme, based on a simple model of the normal rate of change of the key MIBs can be used to determine statistical signatures of attacking behavior. These observations suggest the possibility of an entirely automated procedure centered on network management systems for detecting precursors of distributed denial of service attacks, and responding to them. © 2001 IEEE.","Computer crime; Computer network management; Data security; Information security; Intrusion detection; Monitoring; Samarium; Technology management; Testing; USA Councils","Computer crime; Computer networks; Information management; Intrusion detection; Monitoring; Network management; Network security; Samarium; Security of data; Statistical tests; Testing; Transmission control protocol; Automated procedures; Distributed denial of service attack; Feasibility studies; Management information base; Network management systems; Statistical signatures; Technology managements; USA Councils; Denial-of-service attack"

A laboratory experiment tests several alternative hypotheses about the determinants of failure at detecting Internet deceptions. The findings suggest that Internet consumers process the clues that a site may be deceptive, but are unable to effectively evaluate and combine these clues, i.e., to draw correct conclusions from them. This is good news in the ongoing struggle against Internet fraud because it suggests that consumers lack the knowledge, not the capacity, to detect deceptions and that consumer education programs might be effective in helping consumers to protect themselves. © 2001, Association for Information Systems.

While security policy has long provided a rich area for information security research, the fruits of this research have not always provided major benefits in practice. In hopes of addressing this problem, the DARPA Information Assurance program has sought to experiment with practical aspects of security policy. This paper examines two areas of policy experimentation and lessons learned by such efforts. The areas include mapping policy to real world problems, and making preplanned policy changes in response to changes in the defense ""information condition"" or INFOCON. © 2001 IEEE.","","Security of data; Information assurance programs; Mapping policies; Military environment; Policy changes; Real-world problem; Security policy; Security systems"

The RTI incorporates a number of innovative design concepts and provides fast, reliable, exploitation-resistant communication and coordination services to the components defending the network, even when challenged by a distributed attack. The architecture can be tailored to provide scalable information assurance defenses for large, geographically distributed, heterogeneous networks with multiple domains, each of which uses different technologies and requires different policies. The architecture can form the basis of a field-deployable system.

Critical decisions are made, and critical action is taken based on information from these systems. Therefore, the information must be accurate, correct, and timely, and be manipulated, stored, retrieved, and exchanged safely, reliably, and securely. In a time when information is considered the latest commodity, information security should be top priority. A Practical Guide to Security Engineering and Information Assurance gives you an engineering approach to information security and information assurance (IA). The book examines the impact of accidental and malicious intentional action and inaction on information security and IA. Innovative long-term vendor, technology, and application-independent strategies show you how to protect your critical systems and data from accidental and intentional action and inaction that could lead to system failure or compromise. The author presents step-by-step, in-depth processes for defining information security and assurance goals, performing vulnerability and threat analysis, implementing and verifying the effectiveness of threat control measures, and conducting accident and incident investigations. She explores real-world strategies applicable to all systems, from small systems supporting a home-based business to those of a multinational corporation, government agency, or critical infrastructure system. The information revolution has brought its share of risks. Exploring the synergy between security, safety, and reliability engineering, A Practical Guide to Security Engineering and Information Assurance consolidates and organizes current thinking about information security/IA techniques, approaches, and best practices.

This paper discusses three extensions to these evaluations. First, the Lincoln Adaptable Real-time Information Assurance Testbed (LARIAT) has been developed to simplify intrusion detection development and evaluation. LARIAT allows researchers and operational users to rapidly configure and run real-time intrusion detection and correlation tests with robust background traffic and attacks in their laboratories. Second, ""Scenario Datasets"" have been crafted to provide examples of multiple component attack scenarios instead of the atomic attacks as found in past evaluations. Third, extensive analysis of the 1999 evaluation data and results has provided understanding of many attacks, their manifestations, and the features used to detect them. This analysis is used to develop models of attacks, intrusion detection systems, and intrusion detection system alerts. Successful models could reduce the need for expensive experimentation, allow proof-of-concept analysis and simulations, and form the foundation of a theory of intrusion detection. © 2001 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Mercury (metal); Atomic attack; Attack scenarios; Background traffic; Correlation tests; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multiple components; Proof of concept; Real-time information; Intrusion detection"

The emphasis on security of information transfer during these meetings has made the management of end-to-end security in collaborative IP network environments, that may involve the creation of ad hoc communication networks that contain the Internet as an intermediate network, an important research issue. Addition of security features through standard methods gives rise to complex incompatibility problems resulting from the specific routing and address translation schemes that may be in place in these networks. The development of enhanced protocols that remove this incompatibility and ensure interoperability between security functions and address translation functions is discussed in this paper. Detailed steps in ensuring end-to-end security in various cases involving change of IP address, change of both IP address and the port, and the use of encapsulation security payload implemented in transport mode are described. The enhanced protocols presented here support generic implementation in the sense that the implementation of the security-related protocol is transparent to the use or not of the address translation scheme. For providing a proof of concept demonstration of the proposed solutions, the structure of a prototype collaborative network, which employs the Internet as an intermediate communication medium for supporting videoconferencing between remote stations, is outlined. © 2001 IEEE.","Collaboration; Collaborative work; Communication networks; Encapsulation; Environmental management; Information security; IP networks; Payloads; Protocols; Prototypes","Complex networks; Distributed computer systems; Encapsulation; Environmental management; Information management; Internet; Internet protocols; Network management; Network protocols; Security of data; Telecommunication networks; Video conferencing; Collaboration; Collaborative Work; IP networks; Payloads; Prototypes; Network security"

Security policies define what actions are permitted or not permitted, for what or for whom, and under what conditions. Management policies define what actions need to be carried out when specific events occur within a system or what resources must be allocated under specific conditions. There is considerable interest in the use of policies for the security and management of large-scale networks and distributed services. Existing policy work has focussed on specification, information models and application-specific policy enforcement. We address the important goal of providing a general-purpose deployment model for policies that is independent of the underlying policy enforcement mechanisms and can be employed in mixed policy environments. In this paper, we present a deployment model that is object-oriented and addresses the instantiation, distribution and enabling of policies as well as the disabling, unloading and deletion of policies. The model defines objects for policies, for domains, and for the policy enforcement agent and outlines the interactions needed between them. The model also caters for changes in the memberships of domains since such changes also effect policy enforcement. The model forms part of the run-time support for Ponder; a new policy language that combines structuring ideas from object-oriented languages with a common set of policy basic types. © 2001 IEEE.","Computer network management; Data security; Educational institutions; Information security; Large-scale systems; Object oriented modeling; Quality management; Resource management; Runtime; Specification languages","Computational linguistics; Computer networks; Computer resource management; Large scale systems; Modeling languages; Network management; Network security; Quality management; Security of data; Specification languages; Specifications; Unloading; Application specific; Distributed service; Educational institutions; Information models; Large-scale network; Object oriented model; Resource management; Runtimes; Information management"

In particular the diversity and complexity of information flows between components hold the danger of leaking information. Since information flow analysis, however, tends to be expensive and error-prone, we apply our object-oriented security analysis and modeling approach. It employs UML-based object-oriented modeling techniques and graph rewriting in order to make the analysis easier and to assure its quality even for large systems. Information flow is modeled based on the decentralized label model (Myers and Liskov, 1997) combining label-based read access policy models and declassification of information with static analysis.

Breaches of security can have serious consequences, including theft of confidential corporate documents, compromise of intellectual property, unauthorized modification of systems and data, denial of service, and others. Considerable research has been conducted on threats to security. Numerous sophisticated security methods have been developed, many of which rely on individuals to implement and use them. However, these methods may not accomplish their intended objectives if they are not used properly. Despite the apparent influence of usability, surprisingly little research has been conducted on the trade-off between usability and the degree of security provided by various information security methods. In the present paper, we review the various information security methods that are used, appraise the usability issues, and develop a taxonomy to organize these issues.

Computer security and computer security education are areas of increasing importance as computer systems become more interconnected. When offered, undergraduate and graduate computer security courses are routinely taught using a traditional lecture format. If the course includes a class project, the class project is limited in scope and constitutes a relatively small portion of the student's grade. This paper examines a different approach in which the class project is the dominant factor in the student's grade. The students work in persistent cooperative teams as either a black or gold team. Black teams attempt to break into other black team computers or attack the gold team. The gold team operates Windows NT, LINUX, and Solaris-based servers and attempts to defend their servers and role-play system administrators. The entire exercise takes place in an isolated lab so as to separate student class activities from the rest of the departmental intranet. Four years of experience running the class with this format suggests that the use of persistent cooperative groups and active learning are effective approaches for teaching network security and are preferred over a lecture-based course.","","Computer science; Computer systems; Engineering education; Learning systems; Network protocols; Servers; Students; Teaching; Information security education; Security of data"

Building a data-warehousing system at a regional level, for example in cancerology, requires the participation of all concerned health structures, as well as different health professionals. The heterogeneity of sources medical data of has to be taken into account for choosing between several organizational configurations of the data warehousing system.

Our aim was to bring together researchers coming from coding theory and cryptography. More than 140 participants (77 academics, 27 studients, 19 researchers from industry ...) coming from 31 countries attended the workshop -- France (54), United States (13), Russia (13), Sweden (8), Germany (6), Norway (6), Spain (4), Italy (4), Irland (3), South Korea (3), United Kingdom (3), Canada, Finland, Lituania, The Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Bulgaria, Libanon, Israel, Malawi, India, Japan, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong... A wide range of topics were addressed during the meeting, from the more fundamental, as finite fields theory (dicrete logarithm) and designs to subjects closer to industrial applications as cryptography, convolutional coding or decoding of block codes. Algebraic coding theory was treated in all its variety, from the classical problems as code classification or parameter determination to more recent concerns as codes over rings. Cryptography was also represented in all its components. Let us mention also that some of the talks have treated of the interactions between coding and cryptography.

It has two main purposes. The first purpose is to explain how to model and analyze two important security problems, and how to derive systematic solutions to them. One problem area is the “packet protection problem,” concerning how to use the security services provided by routers—services such as packet filtering and the IP security protocols—to achieve useful protection in complex networks. The other problem area, the “Dolev-Yao” problem, concerns how to determine, given a cryptographic protocol, what authentication and confidentiality properties it achieves, assuming that the cryptographic primitives it uses are ideal. Our secondary purpose is to argue in favor of an overall approach to modeling and then solving information security problems. We argue in favor of discovering security goals for specific domains by examining the threats and enforcement mechanisms available in those domains. Mathematical modeling allows us to develop algorithms and proof methods to ensure that the mechanisms achieve particular security goals. This leads to a systematic approach to trust management, often a more pressing information security problem than inventing new and improved security mechanisms. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.","","Complex networks; Cryptography; Information management; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Problem solving; Security systems; Cryptographic primitives; Cryptographic protocols; Enforcement mechanisms; Security analysis; Security mechanism; Security problems; Security services; Trust management; Network security"

Hierarchical access control is a special access control model in distributed environment, in which each user protects his local data using a secret key; moreover, for any tow related users ui and uj , ui can access uj's data if, and only if, ui's priority is higher than uj. Therefore, there should be a way for ui to obtain the secret key of uj if ui's priority is higher than uj. This paper presents an efficient solutions to the problem. A special kind of function called secure filter is used as the building block of the proposed solution. In the solution, an authorized user can acquire correct keys efficiently and securely via secure filters. The proposed solution is also well-performed while inserting/deleting users, injecting/removing relations, and changing secret keys. Especially, only deleting users and removing relations will change some keys in the system, other operations can be performed freely without affecting other keys in the system; only secure filters need to be modified in these cases.","Access control; Cryptographic key assignment; Secure filter; User hierarchy","Cryptography; Information management; Security of data; Wave filters; Hierarchial access control; Secure filters; Hierarchical systems"

We argue that non-interference is closely related to the characterisation of process equivalence. What constitutes process equivalence is itself a fundamental question in computer science with several distinct definitions proposed in the literature. We illustrate how several of the definitions of non-interference mirror notions of process equivalence. Casting these security concepts in a process algebraic framework clarifies, for example, the role of non-determinism and allows results to be carried over regarding composition and the completeness of unwinding rules.

This can be used to protect the copyright. In this paper, we proposed a fragile watermark used in authentication. It is embedded in the discrete wavelet domain of the image to acquire both local space and frequency support. We do not need the original image while extracting the watermark. Through defining combined correlation of the original watermark with the extracted one, we can detect whether the image has been tampered with and the type of tampering.","Digital watermark; Image authentication; Information security",""

In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of this paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance. Our reasoning framework has been developed by leveraging the concepts of cost analysis and pricing under uncertainty found in economics and finance. Our main result is the modeling of user activity on a computing system as a martingale and the subsequent quantification of the cost of performing a job to enable decision making. © 2001 IEEE.","","Computer simulation; Computer system recovery; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economics; Error detection; Fault tolerant computer systems; Local area networks; Real time systems; Wide area networks; Binary decision; Concurrent intrusion detection scheme; Security of data"

It is my opinion that a substantial portion of information security risk management practitioners tend to think like “foxes.” As a result, they have been concentrating their efforts on the details within the information technology (IT) architecture level, while giving relatively short shrift to the recognition of other aspects of information security controls (including the protection of sensitive and confidential corporate and individual information) at the organizational, procedural, cultural, and, to a lesser extent, physical levels.

The range of existence of the observed regimes depended greatly on the degree of nonlinearly of the watt-ampere energy characteristics, defined by the processes of saturation of inversion of population and the controlled pressure of gas in the active element. Optical chaos in such non-linear systems appears, when the delay is greater than the life times of the metastable states of helium and neon that determine the internal dynamics of the laser.

DHIAP sponsors an interdisciplinary, triservice workgroup for review and revision of relevant DoD and service policies and participates in formal DoD health information assurance activities. These activities help promote a community of proponents across the MHS supportive of improved health information assurance. The MHS HIPAA-compliance effort teaches important general lessons about organizational reform in large civilian or military enterprises.","Data security; Health information assurance; HIPAA; Interdisciplinary; Proponents; Social boundaries","Health care; Information management; Information technology; Laws and legislation; Medical computing; Risk management; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Defense health information assurance program; Health insurance portability and accountability act; Medical information security readiness teams; Military treatment facility; Risk information management; Telemedicine and advanced technology research center; Medical imaging"

Currently, most of the security systems own their particular protocol. When they are used via public networks, they will arise the attention and interest of attacking by those whom like hackers. Data embedding is one of the solutions to remedy this problem. The benefits of utilizing data embedding techniques are twofold. First is the using of a very general host image or media data as the cover image will reduce the attacking interest and thus increase the information security. The second advantage is that every security system used in the Internet must open its protocol. By using the previous idea, the protocol of the security system will be covered by the outer host image and thus could protect the security system. Besides, in order to decode the transmitted data successfully, a novel block spread spectrum technique is also provided to increase the data surviving and recovery rate from lots of different attacks.","Data embedding; Data hiding; Digital watermarking","Computer crime; Data communication systems; Network protocols; Spread spectrum communication; Digital data embedding; Security of data"

The protocol uses electronic cash for payment transactions. In this new protocol, from the viewpoint of banks, consumers can improve anonymity if they are worried about disclosure of their identities. An agent provides a higher anonymous certificate and improves the security of the consumers. The agent will certify re-encrypted data after verifying the validity of the content from consumers, but with no private information of the consumers required. With this new method, each consumer can get the required anonymity level, depending on the available time, computation and cost. We also analyse how to prevent a consumer from spending a coin more than once. Furthermore, we use RBAC to manage the new payment scheme. Each user may be assigned one or more roles, and each role can be assigned one or more privileges that are permitted to users in that role. Security administration with RBAC consists of determining operations that must be executed by persons in particular jobs, and assigning employees to proper roles. RBAC can improve system security and reduce conflicts of different roles. The complexities with RBAC can be decreased by mutually exclusive roles and role hierarchies. © 2001 IEEE.","Access control; Access protocols; Australia; Authorization; Costs; Credit cards; Cryptography; Databases; Information security; Internet","Costs; Cryptography; Database systems; Information systems; Internet; Internet protocols; Security of data; Systems engineering; World Wide Web; Access protocols; Australia; Authorization; Credit cards; Payment transactions; Private information; Role-based Access Control; Security administration; Access control"

Customers have no feasible means for estimating the security level of the products they purchase. The few generally applicable methods require the source code, which is often not delivered with a product. Many of the reported vulnerabilities are robustness problems. Robustness can be functionally assessed without the source code by injecting anomalies, unexpected input elements, to the tested component. The component passes the tests if it can securely handle the injected anomalies. The methods generally applied for software testing and modelling were found to be too complex and rigid for functional robustness assessment. A new minisimulation method using attribute grammar to model both input syntax and software behaviour was proposed. Means for the systematic creation of a large number of test cases was presented. The method was used to test the robustness of 49 software products. A total of 41 tested products were found to be vulnerable to denial-of-service problems, and 14 of them were proven to contain vulnerabilities making it possible to execute remotely supplied code on the host system. Applications of the method include quantitative comparisons and the benchmarking of software components, but it has some limitations. The proportion of the flaws found using the method compared to the actual number of flaws is difficult to assess and the tests may favour some components over others. However, if the method can help to eliminate the most obvious vulnerabilities, it would be much more difficult to find serious flaws using unsystematic methods. This could cut down on the number of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.","Automated testing; Implementation vulnerabilities; Information security; Mini-simulation method; Programming mistakes; Software quality",""

No assurance can be assumed once the system is compromised. Intrusion tolerance, on the other hand, focuses on providing minimal level of services even when some components have been partially compromised. The challenges here are how to take advantage of fault tolerant techniques in the intrusion tolerant system context and how to deal with possible unknown attacks and compromised components so as to continue providing the service. This paper presents our work on applying one important fault tolerance technique, acceptance testing, for building scalable intrusion tolerant systems. First, we propose a general methodology for designing acceptance tests. An acceptance monitor architecture is proposed to apply various tests for detecting compromises based on the impact of the attacks. Second, we make a comprehensive vulnerability analysis on typical commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Web servers. Various acceptance testing modules are implemented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. By utilizing the fault tolerance techniques on intrusion tolerance system, we provide a mechanism for building reliable distributed services that are more resistant to both known and unknown attacks. © 2001 IEEE.","Buildings; Context-aware services; Design methodology; Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant systems; Information security; Intrusion detection; Monitoring; System testing; Web server","Architectural design; Buildings; Computer networks; Fault tolerance; Information services; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Monitoring; Security of data; Web services; World Wide Web; Context aware services; Design Methodology; Fault tolerant systems; System testing; Web servers; Acceptance tests"

As clients join or leave a specific service group, Backward and Forward Secrecy problem occurred. Solving this problem, service group will make a re-key operation periodically. But because of this operation need translation frequently so it may have a bad influence to Real time property, which needs minimum bandwidth requirement. In this paper, we proposed a Group Key Management System, which is comprised of two levels, KD (Key Distributor) subsystem and subgroup, for managing encryption key. A KD (Key Distributor) subsystem is composed of SKDs (Subgroup Key Distributor) and TKD (Top-level Key Distributor). A SKD manages a encryption key of a subgroup. A TKD generates a KD group key that is a eneryption key used in a KD group and transmits it to SKDs with safety. Subgroup consists of hosts in Multicast group. Hosts and a SKD share a encryption key, a subgroup key. This key is generated by a SKD and cannot be disclosed outside of the subgroup. As a result, a load of key management can be distributed into many KD so that the overhead of key translation can be decreased, which is needed at each stage of Multicast traffic. In joining and leaving a Multicast group frequently, a group key is distributed only in a specific subgroup. Therefore the overhead needed to redistribute a key can be decreased. By reducing overhead from security service, we expect to satisfy real time property. © 2001 SPIE.","Backward and Forward secrecy; Group key management system; Multicast","Bandwidth; Multicasting; Real time systems; Security of data; Translation (languages); Group key management systems; Public key cryptography"

An instance of such a model and its formalization have been presented. Important aspects of the model are: (1) because it is framed in terms of operations and data objects that the user sees, the model captures the system's security requirements in a way that is understandable to users; (2) the model defines a hierarchy of entities and references; access to an entity can be controlled based on the path used to refer to it; (3) because the model avoids specifying implementation strategies, software developers are free to choose the most effective implementation; (4) the model and its formalization provide a basis for certifiers to assess the security of the system as a whole. Simplicity and clarity in the model's statement have been primary goals. The model's statement does not, however, disguise the complexity that is inherent in the application. In this respect, we have striven for a model that is as simple as possible but stops short of distorting the user's view of the system.

In many cases, ""red team"" attackers participate in all phases of the experiment and contribute to generating the data required to test the hypothesis. The red team is usually structured to model a well-resourced adversary, such as a foreign, national intelligence agency. The particular experiment described here explored one aspect of the IA program's grand hypothesis of dynamic defense: ""Dynamic modification of defensive structure improves system assurance."" This experiment concentrated on the assertion that autonomic response mechanisms can improve overall system assurance by thwarting an attack while it is underway. In most cases, each attack in this experiment was run first with only ""prevent and detect"" mechanisms enabled, then repeated with ""prevent, detect, and respond mechanisms"" enabled. The key result of this experiment is that the hypothesis was supported.","Command and control systems; Computer network security","Algorithms; Computer crime; Cybernetics; Fuzzy sets; Learning systems; Neural networks; Signal processing; Strategic cyberdefense; Security of data"

While virtually all watermarking schemes introduce some small amount of non-invertible distortion in the image, the new methods are invertible in the sense that, if the image is deemed authentic, the distortion due to authentication can be removed to obtain the original image data. Two techniques are proposed: one is based on robust spatial additive watermarks combined with modulo addition and the second one on lossless compression and encryption of bit-planes. Both techniques provide cryptographic strength in verifying the image integrity in the sense that the probability of making a modification to the image that will not be detected can be directly related to a secure cryptographic element, such as a hash function. The second technique can be generalized to other data types than bitmap images. As an example, a lossless authentication method for JPEG files is presented and some results discussed. In the paper, we also explain that invertible authentication can only be achieved at the expense of not being able to authenticate every possible image. However, it is argued that all images that occur in practice can be authenticated. The techniques provide new information assurance tools for integrity protection of sensitive imagery, such as medical images or images viewed under non-standard conditions when usual criteria for visibility do not apply. © 2001 SPIE.","Digital watermarking; Encryption; Fragile watermarks; Hash; Image integrity; Invertible; Lossless authentication; Steganography; Tamper detection","Algorithms; Cosine transforms; Cryptography; Image compression; Image quality; Security of data; Signal to noise ratio; Hash; Image integrity; Invertible authentication; Lossless compression; Steganography; Tamper detection; Digital watermarking"

Information on principles, techniques and processes used, and the reason for the recording, storing and releasing of audit information for evidentiary purposes have been studied. To assist in determining current practice in the Australian Commonwealth and State Governments the results of an Australia wide survey of all government departments are given and contrasted to the major study for QPS.

Thirdly, we identify Reason's (1990) Generic Error Modeling System/Basic Elements of Production as the most suitable starting point for a socio-technical approach, and demonstrate how its basic elements can be applied to the domain of information security. We demonstrate how the application of the model's concepts, especially the distinction between active and latent failures, offers an effective way of identifying and addressing security issues that involve human behavior. Finally, we identify strengths and weaknesses of this approach, and the requirement for further work to produce a security-specific socio-technical design framework.","","Human engineering; Mathematical models; Security systems; Systems analysis; Safety-critical systems; Security models; Security of data"

A key element of authentication schemes is the use of a message authentication code (MAC). One technique to produce a MAC is based on using a hash function and is referred to as an HMAC. Message Digest 5 (MD5) is one of the algorithms, which has been specified for use in Internet Protocol Security (IPSEC), as the basis for an HMAC. The input message may be arbitrarily large and is processed in 512-bit blocks by executing 64 steps involving the manipulation of 128-bit blocks. There is an increasing interest in high-speed cryptographic accelerators for IPSEC applications such as Virtual Private Networks. As we shall show in the paper, it is reasonable to construct cryptographic accelerators using hardware implementations of HMACs based on a hash algorithm such as MD5. Two different architectures, iterative and full loop unrolling, of MD5 have been implemented using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

And in China, information security is being menaced, for most of the key chip involving the information security devices come from abroad. Developing the key chip-set for information security system is a hard and chief task for China. A research on system-level architecture of single-chip cryptographic data processing is presented.

To counter this trend, the issues of network security at the e-commerce and customer sites must be constantly reviewed and appropriate countermeasures devised. These security measures must be implemented so that they do not inhibit or dissuade the intended e-commerce operation. This paper will discuss pertinent network and computer security issues and will present some of the threats to e-commerce and customer privacy. These threats originate from both hackers as well as the e-commerce site itself. A straightforward comparison could be made of the security weaknesses in the postal system vs. security weaknesses on the Net. The vulnerable spots in both cases are at the endpoints - the customer's computer/network and the business' servers/network. Information flowing in the conduit (trucks/planes and wires) is relatively immune to everyday break-ins. Privacy issues are amongst the major drivers for improved network security along with the elimination of theft, fraud and vandalism. Two major threats to customer privacy and confidence come from sources both hostile to the environment as well as sources seemingly friendly. Coordinated attacks on Yahoo, eBay, ZDNet, Buy.com (on their IPO day) and amazon.com generated a huge amount of publicity and a federal government response. A brief description of these attacks will be given in this paper. Another threat may originate at ostensibly friendly companies such as DoubleClick, MemberWorks and similar firms that collect customer information and route it to other firms. Much of this transaction information is able to be associated with a specific person making these seemingly friendly actions potential threats to consumer privacy. Many of the issues and countermeasure discussed here come from experiences derived with consulting with clients on how to maintain secure e-commerce facilities. These methods and techniques can be useful in a variety of client and server environments, also serving to alert e-commerce users of potential threats. © 2002 IEEE.","Computer hacking; Computer networks; Computer security; Counting circuits; Information security; Internet; Network servers; Privacy; US Government; Wires","Commerce; Computer networks; Computer privacy; Counting circuits; Crime; Data privacy; Electronic commerce; Internet; Networks (circuits); Personal computing; Sales; Security of data; Security systems; Servers; Wire; Computer hacking; Customer information; E-commerce operations; E-commerce security; Federal governments; Network server; Transaction information; US government; Network security"

Past efforts to address guessing attacks in terms of design or analysis considered only protocols executed in isolation. However, security protocols are rarely executed in isolation and reality is always a case of mixed-protocols. In this paper, we introduce new types of attacks called multi-protocol guessing attacks, which can exist when protocols are mixed. We develop a systematic procedure to analyze protocols subject to guessing attacks and use this procedure to derive some syntactic conditions to be followed, in order for a protocol to be secure against multi-protocol guessing attacks. We then use the strand space framework to prove that a protocol will remain secure, given that these conditions are followed, by modeling the conditions within the framework. We illustrate these concepts using the Mellovin and Berritt protocol (EKE) as an example. © 2002 IEEE.","Collaborative work; Communication channels; Conferences; Costs; Cryptographic protocols; Cryptography; Humans; Information security; International collaboration; Isolation technology","Communication channels (information theory); Costs; Cryptography; International cooperation; Security of data; Collaborative Work; Conferences; Cryptographic protocols; Humans; International collaborations; Isolation technology; Network security"

The multitude of systems and processes that generate digital information is vast. The availability of technology has not only provided an effective way for this information to be stored, but has encouraged the growth of the information data set for the world. The rate at which digital information is produced today is incomprehensible, as digital pictures, financial information, communications, phone records, transaction logs, books, and movies are all now increasingly being used in digital form. These changes in technology and culture are having a profound impact on the forensic sciences, as the likelihood that information pertaining to a crime can be found in digital form is high and ever increasing. As a result, the forensic investigator needs state-of-the-art tools and capabilities for extracting, filtering, and analyzing information that might have an impact on a case. And, once this data is found, there is still the task of preserving it with integrity in order to both perform effective and reliable forensic analysis, and for eventual presentation in a court of law. Although we have begun to see advancements in forensics extraction and analysis tools, there is much work to be done to provide technology that can effectively manage and ensure the integrity of digital evidence. Fortunately the computer science and information security field has defined integrity as it pertains to digital information and has contributed a multitude of methods for protecting the integrity of digital data – at least in the general case. Digital integrity can be defined as, “the property whereby digital data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner since the time it was created, transmitted, or stored by an authorized source”. [1] Applying and adapting methods from computer science and information security to the domain of digital evidence is complex and involves technology and the expertise and understanding of what it means to prove the integrity of this digital data that happens to be evidence. The question then is what are we actually trying to prove? Using hashes (operations done to transform one or more fields into a different arrangement) and other cryptographic methodologies, the contents of a piece of digital evidence can be preserved. Mapping this to the definition for integrity above, these mechanisms provide an almost impenetrable means for ensuring that digital information “has not been altered.” Cryptographic hashes can be used to protect evidence from tampering for long periods of time. Using algorithms such as SHA-1 or even the new SHA-2, content integrity can be attested to for many years even under distributed brute force attack. Adding digital signatures to the mix provides a strong and very effective means for proving the “who” of preserved digital data. Thus by applying cryptographic hashes and digital signature technology to the problem of evidence preservation the “who” and “what” of digital data can be maintained with very high levels of integrity. © 2002 Digital Forensic Research Workshop.

Consequently a lot of research has been devoted to security issues resulting in the well developed discipline of cryptology. Research indicates that important problems that can be handled using cryptographic primitives include privacy, integrity, authentication and to some extent also digital copyright protection. Keeping in mind these important information security problems, this paper introduces and analyzes in detail the class of chaotic Kolmogorov systems. More specifically, a comprehensive study on various important properties of instability such as ergodicity, exponential divergence and fulfillment of the mixing condition is provided. This does eventually result in novel theorems under which conditions discrete versions of chaotic Kolmogorov systems are guaranteed to be ergodic and mixing. Since ergodicity and fulfillment of the mixing property can be interpreted as systems theoretic counterparts to the cryptologic terms of confusion and diffusion, this paper finally outlines and refers to various examples how discrete chaotic Kolmogorov systems can successfully be applied to implement algorithms for ensuring privacy, integrity and authenticity and even can become part of a copyright protection system.","","Algorithms; Chaos theory; Data privacy; Security of data; Chaotic Kolmogorov systems; Cryptography"

Furthermore, we show that the cryptographic engine may hurt the performance of voice traffic because of the impossibility to schedule the access to it in order to prioritize traffic. We present an efficient solution for packet header compression, which we call cIPsec, for VoIPsec traffic. Simulation results show that the proposed compression scheme significantly reduces the overhead of packet headers, thus increasing the effective bandwidth used by the transmission. In particular, when cIPsec is adopted, the average packet size is only 2% bigger than in the plain case (VoIP), which makes VoIPsec and VoIP equivalent from the bandwidth usage point of view. © 2002 IEEE.","Bandwidth; Code standards; Communication system security; Cryptography; Delay; Information security; Internet; Speech analysis; Time factors; Traffic control","Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Cryptography; Internet; Internet telephony; Security of data; Security systems; Speech analysis; Speech communication; Traffic control; Voice/data communication systems; Communication system security; Cryptographic engines; Delay; Effective bandwidth; Experimental analysis; Parameters characterizing; Real-time transmissions; Time factors; Wave transmission"

The algorithm computes spectra of the mesh by using eigenvalue decomposition of a Laplacian matrix derived only from connectivity of the mesh. Mesh spectra can be obtained by projecting coordinates of vertices onto the set of eigenvectors. A watermark is embedded by modifying the magnitude of the spectra. Watermarks embedded by using this method are resistant to similarity transformation, random noise added to vertex coordinates, mesh smoothing, and partial resection of the meshes.","Geometric modeling; Graph Laplacian; Information hiding; Information security; Mesh spectra","Copyrights; Data privacy; Data structures; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Image reconstruction; Laplace transforms; Matrix algebra; Security of data; Three dimensional computer graphics; Trees (mathematics); Information hiding; Polygonal meshes; Digital watermarking"

In fact, in July 2002 the U.S. National Information Assurance Acquisition Policy (NSTISSP #11) mandated the use of CC evaluated IT security products in critical infrastructure systems. This standard provides a comprehensive methodology for specifying, implementing, and evaluating the security of IT products, systems, and networks. Because the Common Criteria (CC) for IT Security Evaluation is a relatively new international standard, little written material exists which explains this how-to knowledge, and it's not exactly easy to interpret. Designed to be used by acquiring organizations, system integrators, manufacturers, and Common Criteria testing/certification labs, Using the Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation explains how and why to use the Common Criteria during the acquisition, implementation or evaluation of an IT product, system, network, or services contract. The text describes the Common Criteria methodology; the major processes, steps, activities, concepts, terminology, and how the CC methodology is used throughout the life of a system. It illustrates how each category of user should employ the methodology as well as their different roles and responsibilities.

As information-based businesses become a larger and larger fraction of the global economy, the nature of “business” itself changes. “Work” used to take place in a well-defined location — such as a factory, an office, or a store — at well-defined times, between relatively organized hierarchies of employees. But now, “work” happens everywhere: all over the world, around the clock, between employees, consultants, vendors, and customer representatives. An employee can be productive working with a personal computer and a modem in his living room, without an assembly line, a filing cabinet, or a manager in sight. The Internet’s broad acceptance as a communications tool in business and personal life has introduced the concept of remote access to a new group of computer users. They expect the speed and simplicity of Internet access to translate to their work environment as well. Traveling employees want their private network connectivity to work as seamlessly from their hotel room as if they were in their home office. This increases the demand for reliable and efficient corporate remote access systems, often within organizations for whom networking is tangential at best to the core business. © 2003 by CRC Press LLC.","",""

Roles are a powerful concept for simplifying access control, but their implementation is normally restricted to single systems and applications. In this article we define enterprise roles capable of spanning all IT systems in an organisation. We show how the enterprise role-based access control (ERBAC) model exploits the RBAC model outlined in the NIST standard draft and describe its extensions. We have implemented ERBAC as a basic concept of SAM Jupiter, a commercial security administration tool. Based on practical experience with the deployment of Enterprise Roles during SAM implementation projects in large organisations, we have enhanced the ERBAC model by including different ways of parametrising the roles. We show that using parameters can significantly reduce the number of roles needed in an enterprise and simplify the role structure, thereby reducing the administration effort considerably.

These devices can be connected to the Internet through both physical and wireless connections, and sensitive data transferred to and from these devices are subject to interception by a third party. Real-time encryption/decryption of data in handheld computers is complicated by the limited computing power available in these devices.

To test our hypotheses, we employ a sample of companies rated by the AIMR. We use the AIMR's disclosure quality rating as an independent variable to investigate whether companies have disclosure profiles that carry over to their Web dissemination practices. Our results confirm that they do, although mainly with respect to the presentation of voluntarily produced financial data. Consistent with extant literature on voluntary disclosure, our evidence suggests that firms develop a Web-based dissemination policy based on their size, need to access the capital markets, need to reduce information asymmetry, and their non-Web-based disclosure personality.

Unfortunately, in practice one finds that computer systems are built such that users are not limited to communicating only through the intended communication channels. As a result, a well-founded concern of security-conscious system designers is the potential exploitation of system storage locations and timing facilities to provide unforeseen communication channels to users. These illegitimate channels are known as covert storage and timing channels. Prior to the presentation of this paper twenty years ago the covert channel analysis that took place was mostly ad hoc. Methods for discovering and dealing with these channels were mostly informal, and the formal methods were restricted to a particular specification language. This paper presents a methodology for discovering storage and timing channels that can be used through all phases of the software life cycle to increase confidence that all channels have been identified. In the original paper the methodology was presented and applied to an example system having three different descriptions: English, formal specification, and high order language implementation. In this paper only the English requirements are considered. However the paper also presents how the methodology has evolved and the influence it had on other work. © 2002 IEEE.","Access control; Communication channels; Communication system software; Computer science; Data security; Formal specifications; Information security; Protection; Secure storage; Timing","Access control; Communication channels (information theory); Computational linguistics; Computer science; Computer software; Digital storage; Formal methods; Formal specification; Life cycle; Network security; Security of data; Security systems; Specification languages; Specifications; Communication system software; Discretionary access control; Language implementations; Protection; Secure storage; Software life cycles; System designers; Timing; Computer control systems"

Because secrecy requirements are closely connected with the knowledge of individual agents of a system, our framework employs the modal logic of knowledge within the context of the well-studied runs and systems framework. Put simply, ""secrets"" are facts about a system that low-level agents are never allowed to know. The framework presented here allows us to formalize this intuition precisely, in a way that is much in the spirit of Sutherland's notion of nondeducibility. Several well-known attempts to characterize the absence of information flow, including separability, generalized noninterference, and nondeducibility on strategies, turn out to be special cases of our definition of secrecy. However, our approach lets us go well beyond these definitions. It can handle probabilistic secrecy in a clean way, and it suggests generalizations of secrecy that may be useful for dealing with resource-bounded reasoning and with issues such as downgrading of information. © 2002 IEEE.","Algebra; Carbon capture and storage; Computer science; Context modeling; Information security; Interleaved codes; Logic; Multiagent systems; Research initiatives; System recovery","Algebra; Carbon; Carbon capture; Computer science; Computer system recovery; Network security; Security of data; Security systems; Context modeling; Interleaved codes; Logic; Research initiatives; System recovery; Multi agent systems"

In these models confidentiality is an absolute property stating the absence of any illegal information flow. We present a model in which the notion of non-interference is approximated in the sense that it allows for some exactly quantified leakage of information. This is characterised via a notion of process similarity which replaces the indistinguishability of processes by a quantitative measure of their behavioural difference. Such a quantity is related to the number of statistical tests needed to distinguish two behaviours.

Once subverted, these hosts can not only be used to launch massive denial of service floods, but also to steal or corrupt great quantities of sensitive information, and confuse and disrupt use of the network in more subtle ways. We present an analysis of the magnitude of the threat. We begin with a mathematical model derived from empirical data of the spread of Code Red I in July, 2001. We discuss techniques subsequently employed for achieving greater virulence by Code Red II and Nimda. In this context, we develop and evaluate several new, highly virulent possible techniques: hit-list scanning (which creates a Warhol worm), permutation scanning (which enables self-coordinating scanning), and use of Internet-sized hit-lists (which creates a flash worm). We then turn to the to the threat of surreptitious worms that spread more slowly but in a much harder to detect “contagion” fashion. We demonstrate that such a worm today could arguably subvert upwards of 10,000,000 Internet hosts. We also consider robust mechanisms by which attackers can control and update deployed worms. In conclusion, we argue for the pressing need to develop a “Center for Disease Control” analog for virus- and worm-based threats to national cybersecurity, and sketch some of the components that would go into such a Center. © 2002 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.","","Codes (symbols); Computer viruses; Disease control; Scanning; Viruses; Center for disease controls; Cyber security; Denial of Service; Empirical data; Flash worms; Internet hosts; Robust mechanisms; Sensitive informations; Denial-of-service attack"

Content-based pub-sub systems are often implemented on a peer-to-peer infrastructure that enables information dissemination from information producers (publishers) to consumers (subscribers) through a subscription mechanism. In a wide-area pub-sub network, the pub-sub service must handle information dissemination across distinct authoritative domains, heterogeneous platforms and a large, dynamic population of publishers and subscribers. Such an environment raises serious security concerns. In this paper, we investigate the security issues and requirements that arise in an internet-scale content-based pub-sub system.

The watermarking algorithm described in this paper tries to alleviates two weaknesses of our previous mesh-watermarking algorithm1), that are, (1) the weakness of the watermarks against vertex connectivity changes, due, for example, to mesh simplification, and (2) the high computational cost of the algorithm that prohibits processing of larger meshes. We added resiliency against vertex connectivity changes by recreating the connectivity of the original mesh on the watermarked and possibly attacked mesh by means of mesh resampling. We reduced the computational cost by watermarking disjunct subsets of the mesh. As with our previous watermarks, our new watermarks resist mesh smoothing, cropping, and additive random noise. Furthermore, our watermarks resist a wider class of attacks, including, for example, an attack that combines mesh simplification, si ilarity transformation, and cropping. In addition, our new algorithm is capable of watermarking larger meshes having tens of thousands of vertices. For example, a watermark embedded in a mesh having 66 K polygons survived an attack that combines a mesh simplification down to a half of the original polygon counts followed by a cropping and a similarity transformation. © 2002, The Institute of Image Electronics Engineers of Japan.

With recent advancements in functionality, computing power and network bandwidth it has become practical to use VEs in sensitive areas such as product development with proprietary information and visualization of classified information. Consequently, previously ignored aspects of security need to be made a primary concern at the outset of designing a VE. In this paper we explore security concerns associated with a subtype of VEs: Runtime Extensible VEs (RTEVEs). We introduce a taxonomy of security issues, derived from a case study of NPSNET-V, with the goal of using this taxonomy to guide the formulation of security policy, requirements, and architectures for RTEVEs.","Collaborative environment; Computer security; Information assurance; Runtime extensible virtual environment; Security; Taxonomy; Virtual environment; Virtual reality","Classification (of information); Computer architecture; Computer networks; Decision making; Quality of service; Real time systems; Security of data; Software prototyping; Information systems; Virtual reality"

The result is a mechanism to understand and improve the performance of active networking and Active Virtual Network Management Prediction in particular. The Active Virtual Network Management Prediction mechanism allows information, in various states of algorithmic and static form, to be transported in the service of prediction for network management. The results are generally applicable to algorithmic transmission of information.

In particular, we employ a technique which expands or contracts a packet's service environment based on its level of privilege, termed namespace-based security. As an application of our security architecture, we present the design and implementation of an active-network firewall.

In this paper we present an architecture that allows currently available web servers to become capable of sending and receiving agents in an easy way. By using this approach, existing web infrastructure can be maintained, while gaining a whole new potential by being able to make use of agent technology. Our approach involves wrapping the components inside a Java servlet that can be included in any web server supporting the Servlet Specification. This servlet enables the servers to receive and send agents that can query, local information, and also enables the agents to behave as servlets themselves.

These policies do not account for the behavior of the entire system, and enforcing these policies can have unexpected interactive or concurrent behavior. We present a policy specification, implementation, and enforcement methodology based on formal models of interactive behavior and satisfiability of system properties. We show that changing the operational parameters of our policy implementation entities does not affect the behavioral guarantees specified by the properties. We demonstrate the construction of dynamic access control policies based on safety property specifications and describe an implementation of these policies in the Seraphim active network architecture. We present examples of reactive security systems that demonstrate the power and dynamism of our policy implementations. We also describe other types of dynamic policies for information flow and availability based on safety, liveness, fairness, and other properties.

It is reckoned that the Morris Worm (also known as the Internet Worm) in 1988, initially exposed the vulnerability of Internet, and ushered a new era in information security. Since then, the nature of threat has only progressed to more lethal and sophisticated levels. This has been clearly manifested by the recent Code Red, Sircam and Nimda worms. This paper, while attempting to evaluate these emerging patterns, emphasizes upon the dire need for enhanced information security mechanisms and practices. In the aftermath of 9–11, the US envisages similar attacks on its homeland, which includes cyber-attacks carried out by terrorist outfits on America's information assets. Reflecting on the cyber capabilities of contemporary terrorist groups, especially Al Qaeda, the paper also draws attention to the increasingly blurring lines between the state and non-state actors plying on the slippery lanes of the information superhighway. © 2002 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","Computer programming; Computer viruses; Computer worms; Electronic commerce; Information technology; Internet; Online systems; Personal computers; Program debugging; Communication technology; Web services; Security of data"

Cryptography provides the security by concealing the contents and steganography provides security by concealing existence of information being communicated. Signal processing adds additional security by compressing and transforming the information. The proposed method, viz. Steganography Based Information Protection Method (SBIPM), consists of scanning, coding, encryption, reshaping, cover processing and embedding steps. The scanning, coding, and encryption steps make the information unintelligible so that one cannot extract plain message. Embedding make the message invisible so that one cannot detect it. Reshaping spreads the message so that embedded message can be detected from distorted steganos by authorized receivers. Cover processing makes detection of embedded message more difficult since the distortion is either due to noise addition or due to message embedding. Simulation and steganlysis results show that the method provides high security and the information is safe from various attacks. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Computer simulation; Content based retrieval; Data compression; Digital signal processing; Encoding (symbols); Feature extraction; Information management; Public key cryptography; Scanning; Spurious signal noise; Embedded message; Information protection method; Steganography; Security of data"

Based on these challenges, the role of security in EC is analysed, leading to a wider view called Web assurance.

Our main focus is to minimize the size of the communication overhead required to authenticate the packets. Our approach is to encode the hash values and the signatures with Rabin's Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) to construct an authentication scheme that amortizes a single signature operation over multiple packets. This strategy is especially efficient in terms of space overhead, because just the essential elements needed for authentication (i.e., one hash per packet and one signature per group of packets) are used in conjunction with an erasure code that is space optimal. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we compare our technique with four other previously proposed schemes using analytical and empirical results.

In this new protocol, from the viewpoint of banks, consumers can improve anonymity if they are worried about disclosure of their identities. An agent provides a higher anonymous certificate and improves the security of the consumers. The agent will certify re-encrypted data after verifying the validity of the content from consumers, but with no private information of the consumers required. With this new method, each consumer can get the required anonymity level, depending on the available time, computation and cost. We also analyse how to prevent a consumer from spending a coin more than once and how to use the proposed protocol for Internet purchases.

E-government is actively promoted in many countries during the last decade. However, we found most of published document are action plans, and there are few scientific studies to review its performance. This is an important issue for continuous improvement purpose. In this study, we tried to develop a scale system from the user's subjective aspect.E-government is composed of information system, user interface, and information access channel. Based on the three components, we firstly come up 11 dimensions of government information service by the literature review and experts' opinions. Then we developed 4 items for each dimension. In order to verify the proposed scale system, we invited experts to examine the content validity, and conducted a field study in Hsin-Chu city. Based on the results of factor analysis, we found that the proposed scale can be represented by three dimensions, which are respectively named “system capability”, “website content and design”, and “government promotion”. Cronbach α analyses reveal that each dimension and the scale have high reliability, range from 0.83 to 089. In addition, we found users have relatively dissatisfaction in the dimension of information security, personal service, user-friendly, etc. To improve those dimensions will become the focal points of the next phase of e-government development.

Necessary investments may not take place on the grounds that the returns are not easily quantifiable, when compared with other investments, or in the blithe hope that “it will never happen to us”. Conversely, “fear, uncertainty and doubt” can lead organisations to divert funds towards information security that might be better spent elsewhere. This paper presents Structured Risk Analysis (SRA), a method to help organisations take rational steps to improve their information security. Using SRA, an organisation can place information security in the context of the business as a whole, to determine the appropriate level of resources to be directed toward improvements. Given this budget, SRA enables the organisation to identify how it should be spent to generate the best possible security ‘return’. Whilst other risk analysis methods exist, we believe SRA to be more closely integrated with other business processes, systems development and operations, giving a much firmer context for the analysis and more confidence in the results. It is non-proprietary, does not require specialist software tools and is inherently ‘tuneable’ in the level of detail that is applied: all of which means that SRA is particularly cost-effective. We believe SRA gives business owners the information they need to make truly informed decisions about the security, viability and future direction of their Information Systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.","","Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Investments; Risk assessment; Security of data; Business decisions; Business owners; Business Process; Cost effective; Informed decision; Level of detail; Risk analysis methods; Systems development; Risk analysis"

Many countries have developed, or are preparing, laws and regulations to combat the related threats and to guarantee personal data protection. Despite efforts to construct secure systems, few papers have, as yet, focused on security from the very outset of the system development life-cycle. This paper presents a pragmatic proposal to incorporate the legal and regulatory measures to guarantee personal data protection as a part of the requirements engineering process, instead of an addendum to system deployment. The authors investigate how recent efforts in the requirements engineering field can contribute to improving security issues in information systems, in particular those dealing with personal data. A reusable collection of security requirements and, as a novelty, personal data protection requirements (including information on related software components links) are provided. The pre-defined requirements, together with a simple process model based on requirements reuse, provide a strategy that organizations can use to become privacy-compliant. © 2002 IEEE.","Data engineering; Data privacy; Data security; Information management; Information security; Information technology; Law; Legal factors; Protection; Technology management","Computer software reusability; Information management; Information technology; Laws and legislation; Life cycle; Requirements engineering; Security of data; Data engineering; Law; Legal factors; Protection; Technology managements; Data privacy"

A transaction is a part of a business information system that has one or other functional goal. An order-entry-anddelivering- of-goods transaction forming part of an MRP (materials, requirement & planning) information system is discussed as an example. The proposed methodology includes five successive stages in all, namely initiation, domain analysis, risk assessment, risk analysis and domain monitoring. This paper focuses on the risk analysis stage. The methodology enhances risk management in that it incorporates cognitive fuzzy-logic techniques - as opposed to quantitative techniques such as annual loss exposure (ALE) calculation - to assess and analyse the risks. In this way, it is ensured that full cognisance is taken of the intuitive nature of human observation when assessing and analysing the possible risks to be incurred in an organisation. In addition, the methodology takes into account the vagueness of the decision making process with respect to securing transaction information.","Cognitive fuzzy-logic approach; Fuzzy cognitive map; Information security; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk-management methodology; Transactions","Computer circuits; Decision making; Fuzzy logic; Industrial management; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security of data; Business information systems; Decision making process; Fuzzy cognitive map; Fuzzy logic approach; Management methodologies; Quantitative techniques; Transaction information; Transactions; Risk assessment"

It is clear from this discussion, however, that a first attempt at security documentation reveals a more fundamental problem, the lack of a working security model.

The CIOs are responsible to ensure that information security policies, procedures and practices are adequate to effectively protect information systems. The National Airspace System (NAS) is made up of hundreds of facilities across the country, that provide the services required to operate and maintain the air transportation system. Airports are unique in this network as no two airports are designed the same and, while each one is a single facility, each is occupied by many different tenants who provide many different services. Each service may include one or more information systems, both automated and manual, running independently from all the others. Because of high visibility events such as the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 in 1988, the explosion of TWA Flight 800 in 1996 and the most recent catastrophic events of September 11, 2001, increased security measures have been put in place to protect the flying public from terrorists. The need to share and exchange information effectively and in a timely manner between airport services and systems, with other airport facilities; outside organizations and government agencies, becomes greater each day. The increased requirements defined by previous policy, threat, vulnerability, and risk assessments can be used to derive security services for NAS Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations, as well as Airport Facility (AF) operations. However, conventional solutions may not be suited to the unique needs of an airport environment and may be operationally unacceptable in some cases. This paper discusses some of the ways that information systems security can help ensure that key security services, including access control and authentication, are available and implementable in all systems as needed in these unique airport environments.","","Airports; Information technology; Risk assessment; Security of data; Airspace systems; Security systems"

One fundamental difference between watermarking (Cox et al., 1997; 1999) and generic data hiding resides exactly in the main applicability and descriptions of the two domains. In the digital framework, watermarking algorithms that make use of information hiding techniques have been developed and hiding capacity was naturally used as a metric in evaluating their power to hide information. Whereas the maximal amount of information that a certain algorithm can ""hide"" (while keeping the data within allowable distortion bounds) is certainly related to the ability to assert ownership in court, it is not directly measuring its power of persuasion, in part also because it does not consider directly the existence and power of watermarking attacks. We show why, due to its particularities, watermarking requires a different metric, more closely related to its ultimate purpose, claiming ownership in a court of law. We define one suitable metric (watermarking power) and show how it relates to derivates of hiding capacity. We prove that there are cases where considering hiding capacity is sub-optimal as a metric in evaluating watermarking methods whereas the metric of watermarking power delivers good results. © 2002 IEEE.","Computer science education; Computer security; Data encapsulation; Distortion measurement; Home computing; Information security; Power measurement; Steganography; Usability; Watermarking","Algorithms; Data encapsulation; Digital watermarking; Education computing; Electric power measurement; Security of data; Steganography; Amount of information; Computer Science Education; Distortion measurement; Home computing; Usability; Watermarking algorithms; Watermarking attack; Watermarking methods; Information use"

One of the best-known anomaly detectors used in intrusion detection is stide. Developed at the University of New Mexico, stide aims to detect attacks that exploit processes that run with root privileges. The original work on stide presented empirical results indicating that data sequences of length six and above were required for effective intrusion detection. This observation has given rise to the long-standing question, ""why six?"" accompanied by related questions regarding the conditions under which six may or may not be appropriate. This paper addresses the ""why six"" issue by presenting an evaluation framework that maps out stide's effective operating space, and identifies the conditions that contribute to detection capability, particularly detection blindness. A theoretical justification explains the effectiveness of sequence lengths of six and above, as well as the consequences of using other values. In addition, results of an investigation are presented, comparing stide's anomaly-detection capabilities with those of a competing detector. © 2002 IEEE.","Chromium; Detectors; Privacy; Security","Chromium; Data privacy; Detectors; Mercury (metal); Security of data; Signal detection; Anomaly detection; Critical problems; Detection capability; Evaluation framework; Intrusion detectors; Operational limits; Security; University of New Mexico; Intrusion detection"

This knowledge is provided by network mapping tools. These tools rely on models to represent the entities of interest, and they leverage off network discovery techniques to populate the model structure with the data that is pertinent to a specific target network. Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis. NetMap relies on a comprehensive network model that is not limited to a specific network level; it integrates network information throughout the layers. The model contains information about topology, infrastructure, and deployed services. In addition, the relationships among different entities in different layers of the model are made explicit. The modeled information is managed by using a suite of composable network tools that can determine various aspects of network configurations through scanning techniques and heuristics. Tools in the suite are responsible for a single, well-defined task. © 2002 IEEE.","Computer network reliability; Computer science; Computer security; Data models; Data security; Information analysis; Information security; Monitoring; Network topology; Protection","Complex networks; Computer science; Data structures; Distributed computer systems; Information analysis; Knowledge based systems; Monitoring; Reliability analysis; Security of data; Security systems; Topology; Composable networks; Computer network reliability; Network configuration; Network information; Network topology; Protected networks; Protection; Scanning techniques; Network security"

It rests on three cornerstones - critical infrastructures, organization, and technology. While critical infrastructures are beyond the direct control of the organization, balancing them is a critical component of corporate governance. Total security is neither technically feasible nor operationally practicable. Therefore the organization must determine what information assets must be protected and the degree of protection to be provided for them. As Internet-based commerce diffuses through society, there will be decreasing tolerance on the part of customers for losses stemming from perceived or actual cyber vulnerabilities. Only senior management can initiate the plans and policies that address the different aspects of security in a balanced and integrated manner. Leaving security primarily to the IT function will strengthen just one of the cornerstones - namely, technology - and will not yield the intended results. Security lapses are management failures more than technical failures. This article presents an organizational security approach that senior managers can use as a roadmap to initiate security plans and policies and audit their implementation.","",""

The system boundaries are fuzzy and we can only count the system owner to control his/her assets at some point of time. The generic system parts - those shared globally - are data oriented. The specific system parts - those owned by the local system owner - are information oriented. This fact should have impact on the way we view assets when setting the right security requirements. Many approaches focus only on the generic parts, i.e. to protect the data. They thereby overlook the informational aspect of the asset, In order to find these specific requirements, it is important to analyze the risks related to information so that it can be protected in a satisfactory way. This paper will describe how the problem can be solved by use of a risk analysis approach with so called X-ification. X-ifying is a way of mating together the best available experience with values appropriate for the local target system X. X-ifying factors differ depending on if you look at assets from a data or informational point of view. They also change in importance from asset to asset, from industry to industry and from person to person. © 2002 Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers, New York.","Data security; Information security; Open distributed system; Risk analysis; X-ifying factors","Risk analysis; Security of data; Analysis approach; Generic system; Local system; Open distributed systems; Security requirements; System boundary; Target systems; X-ifying factors; Network security"

There is no more critical need for information sharing than during an international crisis, when international coalitions dynamically form. In the event of a crisis, whether it is humanitarian relief, natural disaster, combat operations, or terrorist incidents, international coalitions have an immediate need for information. These coalitions are formed with international cooperation, where each participating country offers whatever resources it can muster to support the given crisis. These situations can occur suddenly, simultaneously, and without warning. Often times, participants are coalition partners in one crisis and adversaries in another, raising difficult security issues with respect to information sharing. Our specific interest is in the Dynamic Coalition Problem (DCP), with an emphasis on the information sharing and security risks when coalitions are formed in response to a crisis. This paper defines the DCP and explores its intricate, challenging, and complex information and resource sharing, and security issues, utilizing real-world situations, which are drawn from a military domain.","Access control; Distributed systems; Dynamic coalitions; Information security","Client server computer systems; Command and control systems; Computer viruses; Computer worms; Distributed database systems; Military data processing; Access control; Dynamic coalition problem; Information sharing; Security of data"

This document was formally adopted in 1997 by CEN as pre-standard CEN ENV 12924 [1]. A demonstration and implementation effort, which was to be effected in principle at one location, was planned and executed as part of the MEDSEC project. The standard CEN ENV 12924 contains a security categorisation model for information systems in Healthcare, distinguishing six categories, plus some refinements. For each category it specifies the required protection measures. The project task consisted of demonstrating and implementing the standard (as far as possible within a limited period) in a real life situation, and providing feedback on these results to the CEN organisation. To this end, the categorisation scheme, as specified in the standard, was applied to a large part of the information (sub)-systems in the Leiden University Medical Centre. A set of ten sub-systems was then selected for a more detailed investigation. The actual protection status for each sub-system was evaluated on the basis of the recommended protection profiles specified in the standard. For each of the relevant recommendations in the standard, its status was recorded, and remarks were added on its relevance, feasibility, etc. These detailed data have been gathered in separate reports for each sub-system. These reports evidently are confidential, in view of protection of the hospital's information security. A similar, though more limited exercise has been done at Magdeburg University Hospital (UHM), in order to be able to allow for possible differences in local situations. A thorough comparison of results for different hospitals was beyond the scope of the project, however. From the overall picture we have tried to draw conclusions on the quality, completeness and applicability of the standard, as well as on the actual level of protection of the systems. As a by-product of the investigation, for all systems out of the small group, implementation plans have been specified to bring the protection in the various (sub)-systems on a higher level, where necessary. Subsequently, these plans have been realised to a large extent. To facilitate the bookkeeping of the results, we have used the SIDERO model [2], resulting from the SEISMED project [3]. This model has been enhanced, for this purpose, with the recommendations from this standard. A brief description of this database model has been included in Appendix B. As an overall conclusion, we may state that the standard has proven to be a very useful instrument, providing a good basis for a security review of the types of Healthcare information systems which are encountered in a hospital environment. Some suggestions have been presented, for amending recommendations that were found too unpractical or too heavy in the circumstances considered. Also, we suggest to add one category to the set of six which is being used now. Furthermore, the use of a 'bookkeeping tool' (like e.g. SIDERO) is strongly recommended.","","Computer Security; Computer User Training; Confidentiality; European Union; Hospital Information Systems; Hospitals, General; Quality Control; Systems Integration; Health care; Hospitals; Information use; Medical computing; Security of data; Database modeling; Health care information system; Health informatics; Hospital environment; Large parts; Protection measures; Protection profile; Sub-systems; article; computer security; confidentiality; European Union; general hospital; hospital information system; human computer interaction; quality control; standard; system analysis; Medical information systems"

APA are a universal and very flexible operational description concept for communicating automata. Their specification, analysis and verification is supported by the SH-verification tool (SHVT). The local state of each agent is structured in several components describing its knowledge of keys, its ""view"" of the protocol and the goals to be reached within the protocol. Communication is modeled by adding messages to and removing them from a shared state component network. Cryptography is modeled by symbolic functions with certain properties. In addition to the regular protocol agents an intruder is specified, which has no access to the agents' local states but to the network. The intruder may intercept messages and create new ones based on his initial knowledge and on what he can extract from intercepted messages. Violations of the security goals can be found by state space analysis performed by the SHVT. The method is demonstrated using the symmetric Needham-Schroeder protocol, and an attack is presented that does not involve compromised session keys. Our approach defers from others in that protocol specifications do not use implicit assumptions, thus protocol security does not depend on whether some implicit assumptions made are reasonable for a particular environment. Therefore, our protocol specifications explicitly provide relevant information for secure implementations. © 2002 IEEE.","Access protocols; Algorithm design and analysis; Authentication; Automata; Cryptographic protocols; Cryptography; Information security; Performance analysis; Power system modeling; State-space methods","Authentication; Automata theory; Expert systems; Security of data; Specifications; State space methods; Access protocols; Algorithm design and analysis; Automata; Cryptographic protocols; Performance analysis; Power system model; Cryptography"

This is in order to ensure a high level of consistency in information security and integrity. On the other hand, ensuring that users have access to security techniques that meet their needs, so that they can trust in the security of information and communications systems while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data on such systems, is a must. For example, in many countries, law enforcement can lawfully access stored data or intercept communications under certain conditions. The important law enforcement tools necessary to carry out these exercises could be hampered by the use of uncontrolled cryptography, which may prevent lawful access to either plaintext or cryptographic keys of encrypted data. The privacy and integrity of data on communications systems are of vital importance. This paper addresses the issue at stake in communication security and the user's right to information on legal and social ramifications. This work describes how vital security techniques may be to information technology especially in the Internet era and how there could be a balance to individual privacy [Computers System and Network Security: Principles and Practice, 1999] and public safety in communication. This is one of the most essential issues at stake in communication security. It evaluates the threat caused by intrusion/violations of privacy rights by law enforcement agents and presents a better strategy of how crime can be traced and how criminals might be arrested by law enforcement agents without violating users' privacy rights.

Droste showed the method for constructing VSSS based on basis matrices whose contrast was high. Koga, Iwamoto, and Yamamoto also proposed the method for constructing a lattice-based VSSS and its polynomial representation. It is known that many good VSSSs are not in the class of lattice-based VSSSs. In this paper, we show the well-defined polynomial representation of a VSSS based on permuting different matrices for black-white images. The necessary and sufficient condition of the existence of a VSSS based on permuting different matrices can be obtained from the proposed polynomial representation. This condition is useful for constructing a good VSSS. We also point out that without additional data, it is possible to achieve member verification by using a VSSS. Using the proposed polynomial representation, the probability of detecting a cheater is analyzed.","Information security; Polynomial representation; Visual secret sharing","Image quality; Image reconstruction; Linear programming; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Polynomials; Probability; Security of data; Polynomial representation; Visual secret sharing scheme; Image analysis"

While usage control concepts have been mentioned off and on in the security literature for some time, there has been no systematic treatment so far. By unifying these three areas UCON offers a promising approach for the next generation of access control. Traditional access control has focused on a closed system where all users are known and primarily utilizes a server-side reference monitor within the system. Trust management has been introduced to cover authorization for strangers in an open environment such as the Internet. Digital rights management has dealt with client-side control of digital information usage. Each of these areas is motivated by its own target problems. Innovations in information technology and business models are creating new security and privacy issues which require elements of all three areas. To deal with these in a systematic unified manner we propose the new UCON model. UCON enables finer-grained control over usage of digital objects than that of traditional access control policies and models. For example, print once as opposed to unlimited prints. Unlike traditional access control or trust management, it covers both centrally controllable environment and an environment where central control authority is not available. UCON also deals with privacy issues in both commercial and non- commercial environments. In this paper we first discuss access control, trust management, and digital rights management and describe general concepts of UCON in the information security discipline. Then we define components of the UCON model and discuss how authorizations and access controls can be applied in the UCON model. Next we demonstrate some applications of the UCON model and develop further details. We use several examples during these discussions to show the relevance and validity of our approach. Finally we identify some open research issues.","","Computer operating systems; Computer privacy; Information technology; Internet; Servers; Access control; Digital rights management; Trust management; Usage control; Security of data"

The lifecycle, from the point of view of the victim host, consists of four stages: target selection, exploitation, infection, and propagation. While not all worms fall into this framework perfectly, by understanding them in this way, it becomes apparent that the majority of detection techniques used today focus on the first three stages. This paper presents a technique that is used in the fourth stage to detect the class of worms that use a horizontal scan to propagate.

Unconventional collaborations among businesses and organizations are formed to advance common goals. In this paper, we address the security services to support inter-organizational collaborative enterprises, which may span multiple organizations, and describe how we develop a secure workflow system to satisfy the requirements by integrating with existing, wellknown technologies.

One of the best-known anomaly detectors used in intrusion detection is stide. Developed at the University of New Mexico, stide aims to detect attacks that exploit processes that run with root privileges. The original work on stide presented empirical results indicating that data sequences of length six and above were required for effective intrusion detection. This observation has given rise to the long-standing question, ""Why six?"" accompanied by related questions regarding the conditions under which six may or may not be appropriate. This paper addresses the ""Why Six"" issue by presenting an evaluation framework that maps out stide's effective operating space, and identifies the conditions that contribute to detection capability, particularly detection blindness. A theoretical justification explains the effectiveness of sequence lengths of six and above, as well as the consequences of using other values. In addition, results of an investigation are presented, comparing stide's anomaly-detection capabilities with those of a competing detector.","","Algorithms; Computer privacy; Computer viruses; Time series analysis; Anomaly detection; Intrusion detector; Sequence time delay embedding; Security of data"

Information systems are increasingly interconnected, interdependent, and complex. Information assurance (IA) attempts to answer critical questions of trust and credibility associated with our digital environment. It presents myriad considerations and decisions that transcend many dimensions: technological advancement, legal, political, economic, social, cultural, institutional, organizational, and educational. Despite the millions of dollars spent on firewalls, encryption technologies, and intrusion detection software, information infrastructure vulnerabilities and disruptive incidents continue. These trends have a significant impact on military operations now and for the next decades. This paper identifies and develops a methodological framework for assessing and managing IA risks. The methodology is based on the systems engineering design process as well as on the guiding principles of risk assessment and management. It builds on hierarchical holographic modeling (HHM) and risk filtering, ranking, and management (RFRM). HHM identifies a plethora of risk scenarios and sources of risk that are innate in current complex information systems. The flexibility of the HHM philosophy permits limitless representations of systems perspectives, constrained only by the knowledge, creativity, and imagination of the analyst and the appropriateness of the modeling efforts. RFRM is an eight-phase process that filters the hundreds of risk scenarios down to a manageable few (10-20), and ranks them. The risk management phase then identifies the acceptable policy options and analyzes the tradeoffs among them by using quantifiable risk management tools. This process analyzes the wealth of statistical data on losses due to system failures, to intrusions, or to vulnerabilities of information assurance. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Information assurance; Information operations; Information warfare; Knowledge management; Multiobjective trade-off analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management","Computer software; Economics; Holography; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Information assurance; Information operations; Information warfare; Information science"

To protect information systems from intrusions and thus assure the reliability and quality of service of information systems, it is highly desirable to develop techniques that detect intrusions into information systems. Many intrusions manifest in dramatic changes in the intensity of events occurring in information systems. Because of the ability of exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts to monitor the rate of occurrences of events based on the their intensity, we apply three EWMA statistics to detect anomalous changes in the events intensity for intrusion detections. They include the EWMA chart for autocorrelated data, the EWMA chart for uncorrelated data and the EWMA chart for monitoring the process standard deviation. The objectives of this paper are to provide design procedures for realizing these control charts and investigate their performance using different parameter settings based on one large dataset. The early detection capability of these EWMA techniques is also examined to provide the guidance about the design capacity of information systems.

Applying this definition in real-life settings to determine whether or not an attack was caused by an insider is often, however, anything but straightforward. We know very little about insider attacks, and misconceptions concerning insider attacks abound. The belief that ""most attacks come from inside"" is held by many information security professionals, for example, even though empirical statistics and firewall logs indicate otherwise. This paper presents a framework based on previous studies and models of insider behavior as well as first-hand experience in dealing with insider attacks. This framework defines relevant types of insider attack-related behaviors and symptoms-""indicators"" that include deliberate markers, meaningful errors, preparatory behaviors, correlated usage patterns, verbal behavior and personality traits. From these sets of indicators, clues can be pieced together to predict and detect an attack. The presence of numerous small clues necessitates the use of quantitative methods; multiple regression equations appear to be a particularly promising approach for quantifying prediction.","Attack indicators; Insider; Insider attack detection; Insider attack prediction; Insider attacks; Insider threat","Computer system firewalls; Computer systems; Internet; Mathematical models; Personnel; Regression analysis; Security of data; Attack indicators; Insider attack detection; Insider attack prediction; Insider attacks; Insider threat; Computer crime"

Embedding strategy, embedding formula and the watermark strength all affect robustness of watermarks. A new embedding strategy for watermarking is proposed based on DWT domain. Based on the wavelet coefficient distribution and a quantitative analysis on the magnitudes of wavelet coefficients, watermarks should be embedded in the low frequency subband firstly, and the remains of the watermarks should be embedded in high frequency subbands according to the significance of subbands. Different embedding formulae should be applied on the low frequency subband and high frequency subbands respectively. Applying this strategy, an adaptive algorithm incorporating the feature of visual masking of human vision system into watermarking is proposed. The algorithm organizes wavelet coefficients to form wavelet blocks and applies a novel method to classify these wavelet blocks. Watermark components with different strength are inserted into different wavelet coefficients based on the results of classification. The experimental results show that the watermarks generated with the proposed algorithm are invisible and robust against noise and commonly used image processing techniques.","Image watermarking; Information hiding; Information security; Visual masking; Wavelet transform","Adaptive algorithms; Classification (of information); Image processing; Security of data; Wavelet transforms; Discrete wavelet transform domain; Embedding algorithms; Frequency subbands; Image watermarking; Information hiding; Visual masking; Wavelet coefficients; Digital watermarking"

A computer system connected to the network is accessible from another computer in this network regardless of its geographical position. Along with providing many benefits for legitimate users this technology creates almost unlimited opportunities for malicious persons, which using software vulnerabilities may successfully penetrate the networked computer systems. In order to eliminate potential devastating consequences caused by breaches in computer systems, more and more attention is drawn to the information security problems. However, despite these efforts, the occurrences of the security violations in the computer networks became increasingly frequent. In this paper we discuss an approach to detect the intrusions. Being able to accurately recognize its legitimate users a system may effectively detect masqueraders. The paper particularly focuses on the question of temporal pattern extraction from user behavior and shows that sequential patterns are not the only ones that may be found in user events sequences. There are also temporal patterns present in user behavior, which together with sequential may be used for efficient user recognition.","Anomaly intrusion detection; Behavior profiling; Network security; Online learning; Pattern matching","Computer system firewalls; Electronic crime countermeasures; Learning systems; Pattern matching; Social sciences computing; User interfaces; Anomaly intrusion detection; Behavior profiling; Online learning; Temporal pattern extraction; Security of data"

The approach is practical and feasible supporting real-time encryption of data rates from 155.52 Mbit/s up to 2.4 Gbit/s, based on existing, commercially available electronic technologies. The system deploys a nonrestricted symmetric-key block algorithm with dynamic parallel-processing width according to the input data rates. The algorithm enables the system to support different key strengths according to dynamic key length and processing block size assignment. The operation principle is based on time-to-frequency translation of differentially coded data blocks from the input data stream after optical-to-electronic conversion and utilization of the resulting wideband multitone radio-frequency (RF) signal to modulate a laser source being fed back to the optical fiber network. An identical scheme implemented in time-reversed order is established during the decryption process to recover the wideband multitone RF signal from the optical fiber and decode the original data, based on a synchronized code generation scheme, before it is transferred back to the optical fiber. The total system bandwidth depends on data rates at input and expected encryption strength and can vary from 2020 MHz for an OC-3 link up to 12,900 MHz for an OC-48 link.","Block encryption algorithm; Dynamic code space; Encryption; Fiber optic networks; Link encryption; Optical communications; Security","Algorithms; Bandwidth; Cryptography; Fiber optic networks; Optical systems; Real time systems; Security of data; Block encryption algorithm; Dynamic code space; Optical communication"

Many existing signature recognition techniques for intrusion detection cannot handle huge amounts of complex data from computer and network systems to detect intrusions in a scalable, incremental manner. This paper presents an application of an innovative data-mining algorithm - CCAS - to intrusion detection through intrusion signature recognition. CCAS provides a scalable, incremental procedure to learn clusters of different classes (i.e. normal and intrusive classes) from historic training data of normal and intrusive activities in computer and network systems. These clusters of normal and intrusive computer activities are used to classify observed data of computer activities for intrusion detection. Two different methods of learning clusters are developed, tested and compared: grid based and dummy-cluster based. Training and testing data are computer audit data produced by the Basic Security Module of a Solaris operating system to record activities in a UNIX-based host machine. The two methods of CCAS are tested using four different input orders of training data points to examine the robustness (sensitivity) of these methods to the input order of training data points. The detection performance and robustness of both CCAS methods are analyzed. The testing results show that different input orders of training data have a certain impact on the performance of both methods. The impact on the performance of CCAS based on dummy clusters is more significant when all normal data are presented first, before attack data in the training data set. CCAS based on dummy clusters produces a better performance than grid-based CCAS for three of the four input orders, and in overall produces fewer clusters and thus requires less computation time in clustering and classification for intrusion detection.

On the other hand the health information systems (HIS) are undergoing rapid development both in the number of installed systems as in the law and regulations governing HIS developments and deployment. The project was aimed at reviewing the AS/NZCS 4444 standard from the HIS requirements point of view. In this paper, we began with an overview of healthcare information systems (HIS) infrastructure in New Zealand and associated security issues around privacy and confidentiality, followed by a general review of the security baseline approach. We analyzed each clause of the AS/NZS 4444 with the information collected about technical and non-technical approaches to protecting HIS, consisting of a series of multi-case studies of healthcare organizations that collect, process, store and transmit electronic medical records. Finally, we proposed a new set of information security baselines based on the research to build an information security model for healthcare organizations.","Electronic medical records; Healthcare information systems; Information privacy; Information security baselines; Security model","Computer privacy; Data communication systems; Data privacy; Health care; Hospital data processing; Laws and legislation; Electronic medical records; Healthcare information systems; Information privacy; Information security baselines; New Zealand; Security model; Security of data"

Scrambling is a common approach used by conditional access systems to prevent unauthorized access to audio/visual data. The descrambling keys are securely distributed to the receivers in the same transmission channel. Their protection is an important part of the key management problem. Although public-key cryptography provides a viable solution, alternative methods are sought for economy and efficiency. Message authentication is an important objective of information security in modern electronic distribution networks. This objective is met by providing the receiver of a message an assurance of the sender's identity. As physical protection such as sealed envelopes is not possible for messages expressed as binary sequences, digital tools have been developed using cryptography. A major limitation of all cryptographic methods for message authentication lies in their use of algorithms with fixed symmetric or public keys. This paper presents a key transport protocol based on secret sharing. Conditional access and message authentication are two important application areas for which the advantages of the proposed protocol are discussed. The protocol eliminates the need for a cipher, yet effectively combines the advantages of symmetric and public-key ciphers. It can be used to build a new key management scheme that allows the service providers to generate different keys for different sets of receivers, and to renew these keys in a convenient way.","Cipher; Conditional access; Content protection; Data integrity; Digital signature; Encryption; Hashing; Key transport; Message authentication; Multimedia; Prepositioned secret sharing; Public-key cryptography","Algorithms; Electronic document identification systems; Multimedia systems; Network protocols; Public key cryptography; Transport protocols; Security of data"

The HIT technique can transform any type of media represented by a long binary string into innocuous text that follows correct grammatical rules. This technique divides English words into types where each word can appear in any number of types. For each type, there is a dictionary, which maps words to binary codes. Marker types are special types whose words do not repeat in any other type. Each generated sentence must include at least one word from the marker type. In the hiding phase, a binary string is input to the HIT encoding algorithm, which then selects sentence templates at random. The output is a set of English sentences according to the selected templates and the dictionaries of types. In the retrieving phase, the HIT technique uses the position of the marker word to identify the template used to build each sentence. The proposed technique greatly improves the efficiency and the security features of previous solutions.

The intensity of the light emitted by a raster-scan screen as a function of time corresponds to the video signal convolved with the impulse response of the phosphors. Experiments with a typical personal computer color monitor show that enough high-frequency content remains in the emitted light to permit the reconstruction of readable text by deconvolving the signal received with a fast photosensor. These optical compromising emanations can be received even after diffuse reflection from a wall. Shot noise from background light is the critical performance factor.

This level of permanent and extensive data access will be revolutionary for the fields of communication, information, security and health care. On the one hand, to make this vision become reality, the presently available hardware must be further reduced in size and energy dissipation. On the other, the users of these embedded devices want to be more independent of power supply systems. We therefore strive for more convenient power supplies. Since the user produces energy as body heat in the order of several 10 watts, it is an obvious move to try and harness part of this energy. Miniaturised thermogenerators can exploit temperature differences between the surface of the human body and its environment by converting the heat flux into electrical energy. In many respects thermogenerators show favourable properties compared to batteries: they are washable, robust, consist of environmentally friendly materials and possess a virtually unlimited lifetime. However, for many years thermogenerators have been restricted to niche applications such as power supplies for space missions. With increasing efficiency of the thermoelectric materials, decreasing power consumption of microelectronic circuitry and reduced production cost, thermoelectric devices might now be heading for important breakthroughs. Today battery-free wristwatches working on this principle are commercially available. The energy consumption of the Seiko wristwatch is 1 microwatt with a driving voltage of 1.5 volts. Striving in this direction, our goal is to evaluate different types of thermogenerator suited to comfortable integration into smart clothes. For this purpose, Infineon Technologies has created a novel micromachined thermoelectric generator chip ready for implementation which has lately been significantly improved. Furthermore we care about application issues, and therefore analyse the heat distribution of the dressed human body. The aim of this action is to find designated places for implantation of the devices. Locations of specific interest are close to the skin like wristbands, cuffs, collars, belts, jeans buttons etc. In recent days, our team has built up skills and experience in textile integration of electric components to deal with the challenges presented by smart clothes.","","apparel fabric; electronics; energy; heat transfer; smart fabric"

There have been some advances in asymptotic theory concerning capacity of WM as well as in some practical proposals, mainly where WM is applied without any theory. Most of times, references are made to public watermarking, in which the watermark detector does not require any secret key at all. In this paper, our contribution is a WM that we name semipublic watermarking. This is a scenario in which any ordinary user is enabled to detect WM without any secret key, if the message is not subject of attack trying to remove its WM. Moreover, at any time, the owner of WM is able to detect WM even after such an attack. We propose two methods of semipublic WM and we calculate the probabilities Pm, of missing WM (when WM is present, indeed), and Pfa of WM false alarm (when WM is absent but its presence is supposed). The first method guarantees that both Pm and Pfa converge to zero as the number N of WM elements increases, only if the distortion constraints are very strong. In second method also Pm, Pfa converge to zero as N increases, for any distortion constraints, but it is required the so called property of quadratic compensation: In order to compensate an m times increase of the distortion constraint ""signal-to-noise ratio"", the number at WM elements should increase m2 times. Although we consider just additive noise attacks, our results are useful since they provide lower bounds for WM reliability for any optimal attack with given distortion constraints.","Copyright protection; Information hiding; Information security; Watermarking","Boundary conditions; Constraint theory; Poles and zeros; Probability; Signal to noise ratio; Cover message; Digital semipublic watermarking; Information hiding; Quadratic compensation; Digital watermarking"

In the last 20 years, it has been argued that security-engineering practices have not kept pace with the escalating threats to information systems. Much has occurred since that time - new security paradigms, failure of evaluated products to emerge into common use, new systemic threats, and an increased awareness of the risk faced by information systems.

We have modeled and validated a variety of DoS attacks and have executed these models against a validated target network model, whose architecture and stochastic behavior is varied for analysis purposes. We have conducted a systems analysis using these models and have characterized attack effects. This paper describes the analysis of two attacks, each of which consumes resources at a server.

Although unlinkability protects the privacy of customers and users, it may be abused by criminals for such purposes as to launder money or to safely get a ransom. The techniques of fair blind signatures are developed to deal with the abuse of unlinkability. In this paper we propose a user efficient fair blind signature scheme which makes it possible for a government or a judge to recover the link between a signature and the instance of the signing protocol which produces that signature when the unlinkability property is abused. Only two integers are required to form a signature in the proposed fair blind signature scheme. Furthermore, it only takes several modular multiplications for a user to obtain and verify a signature. It turns out that the scheme is suitable for situations where computation capability of users or customers is limited, such as smart cards and mobile units. Compared with existing blind signature schemes proposed in the literatures, our method reduces the computation required of users by more than 99%.","Blind signatures; Cryptology; Electronic cash; Information security; Privacy","Cryptography; Data privacy; Network protocols; Security of data; Blind signatures; Electronic document identification systems"

Due to its growing use and obvious vulnerability, wireless communication is in particular need of protection. As available computational power increases, transmitters will be able to implement sophisticated preceding to increase transmission security. In this paper, we consider the security-enhancing capability of algebraic channel decomposition multiplexing (ACDM), a form of multipulse spread-spectrum preceding for dispersive wireless channels that results in in orthogonal signaling at the receiver. In ACDM, the transmit code vectors are determined from the SVD of the convolution matrix describing the channel between the transmitter and desired receiver. Since any potential transmitter-eavesdropper channel will have a different multipath structure, eavesdroppers' ability to detect and decode the transmissions can be severely reduced. We develop semi-analytical formulae for the performance penalty experienced by an eaves-dropper employing the optimum linear MMSE receiver under the worst-case assumptions that it has perfect knowledge of the transmit code set and its own channel response. Using realistic channel models we demonstrate that such an eavesdropper experiences a significant performance degradation, and show that this degradation is due to a combination of diversity loss and inter-code interference.","","Communication channels (information theory); Convolution; Matrix algebra; Multipath propagation; Multiplexing; Security of data; Signal interference; Spread spectrum communication; Vectors; Algebraic channel decomposition multiplexing; Convolution matrix; Eavesdropping; Physical layer security; Transmit code vectors; Wireless telecommunication systems"

However, the two requirements pull in different directions and balancing them to meet the application needs is still an open issue. In this paper we introduce a hybrid key tree scheme to balance security, namely the resistance to collusion, and the efficiency. The resistance to collusion is measured by an integer parameter. The communication and the storage requirements for the controller depend on this parameter too, and they decrease as the resistance to collusion is relaxed. We analytically evaluate the efficiency of our scheme and compare with the previous work. The results show that our scheme allows a fine-tuning of security requirements versus efficiency requirements at run-time, which is not possible with the previous key management schemes. © 2003 IEEE.","Application software; Communication system control; Costs; Electrical resistance measurement; Information security; Multicast communication; Runtime; Teleconferencing; Unicast; Web and internet services","Application programs; Costs; Forestry; Internet; Multicasting; Security of data; Teleconferencing; Communication system control; Electrical resistance measurement; Internet services; Multicast communication; Runtimes; Unicast; Efficiency"

Clients interact with the file manager only to acquire the meta-data information and some cryptographic primitives, for example, access keys. Most of the current schemes rely on a centralized file manager to support these activities. This paper presents security mechanisms for decentralized authentication for object-based storage. The schemes are novel in several ways. First of all, they reduce the load on the file manager and free the system from central point of failure and denial of service attacks. We exploit Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to provide scalability and design authentication schemes that efficiently utilize RBAC. In most of the cases, the client needs to acquire only one access key from the file manager, which can be used by the client to further derive role-keys for the roles that he/she is permitted to play within an organization. Further, the number of cryptographic keys required for the purpose of authentication in these schemes is less as compared to the existing schemes. Finally, we also present two simple schemes that enable the clients to access objects stored on any device on the network using a single identity key. © 2003 IEEE.","Access control; Authentication; Computer crime; Computer science; Cryptography; Data engineering; Information security; Scalability; Secure storage; Utility programs","Access control; Authentication; Computer crime; Computer science; Denial-of-service attack; Managers; Network security; Scalability; Security of data; Utility programs; Virtual storage; Authentication mechanisms; Authentication scheme; Cryptographic primitives; Data engineering; Object-based storage; Object-based storage devices; Role-based Access Control; Secure storage; Cryptography"

With the large-scale use of information technologies as a general communication medium, facilitating deception detection is a key enabler to utilizing information systems to their fullest potential. This article presents a framework for computer-aided deception detection building on the interpersonal deception theory (IDT) of human interpersonal communication research and text-processing techniques for facilitating deception analysis of text-oriented communication. A state-transition diagram based framework is proposed to model the dynamic evolution of an interpersonal conversation between a sender and receiver based on the IDT-based process schemata.

Yet, the current network security mechanisms are passive in response to network-based intrusions. In order to hide their origins, intruders usually use incorrect or spoofed source IP addresses breaking into targets. It is difficult to identify the real source of these network-based intrusions due to the nature of the IP protocol. This paper presents the design of distributed intrusion source identification system (DISIS) based on agents. It is comprised of several agents of different types, which can be developed respectively. The agents communicate with each other when they take their actions. DISIS can cooperate with any other intrusion detection system. This system can be installed in router or a dedicated device connected to router. DISIS can trace single source attack or multiple sources attack on-line or off-line. © 2003 IEEE.","Electronic mail; High-speed networks; Information science; Information security; Information systems; Intrusion detection; IP networks; Protocols; Telecommunication traffic; Testing","Computer networks; Electronic mail; HIgh speed networks; Information science; Information systems; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Mobile computing; Network protocols; Security of data; Telecommunication traffic; Testing; Intrusion Detection Systems; IP networks; Multiple source; Network-based; Networked information systems; Security mechanism; Single source; Source identification; Network security"

Our evaluation shows that sample entropy of ping packets' round trip time is an effective feature statistic to discover the payload traffic rate. We propose simple countermeasures that can significantly reduce the effectiveness of ping-based active traffic analysis attacks.

We make use techniques of fault tolerant computing, specifically redundancy, diversity, acceptance test, textitvoting - , as well as adaptive reconfiguration. Our architecture consists of five functional components that work together to extend the fault tolerance capability of COTS servers. In addition, the architecture provides mechanisms to audit the COTS servers and internal components for signs of compromise. The auditing as well as adaptive reconfiguration components evaluate the environment threats, identify potential sources of compromise and adaptively generate new configurations for the system. © 2003 IEEE.","Cities and towns; Computer architecture; Fault tolerance; Information security; Information systems; Intrusion detection; Mission critical systems; Network servers; Protection; Redundancy","Acceptance tests; Fault tolerance; Information systems; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Network architecture; Redundancy; Security of data; Servers; Cities and towns; Fault-tolerance capability; Intrusion tolerant system; Mission critical applications; Mission critical systems; Network server; Proposed architectures; Protection; Computer architecture"

However, for a comprehensive intranet security strategy, such defenses alone may not be enough. An enterprise needs mechanisms to analyze alerts and detect real attacks, and policies on how to respond to attacks. A framework for effective response to detection of misuse or attack is a central theme. The focus is towards security of corporate intranets. We first discuss the access control models that are currently being deployed and used at most intranet solutions. Using role based access control as a base, we develop a framework of interaction of various entities in the model. We then propose a prioritization scheme based on cost of impact in case of misuse and business criticality of transactions. The scheme is developed based on categorization and prioritization of risk and vulnerability assessment results for an enterprise intranet. Alerts are a critical element of a real-time response, but how alert engines operate and filter tons of log data decides the effectiveness of such infrastructure. We propose incorporation of priority schemes into alert mechanisms to develop a more effective intrusion countermeasure against misuse and attack. It leverages the enterprise's investment in security technology to develop an optimized solution to respond to those attacks, by advising the enterprise's on-site administrators. © 2003 IEEE.","Access control; Authorization; Computer science; Costs; Data security; Filters; Information security; Investments; Search engines; USA Councils","Computer science; Costs; Cybernetics; Filters (for fluids); Intranets; Investments; Mercury (metal); Risk assessment; Search engines; Security of data; Access control models; Authorization; Optimized solutions; Prioritization schemes; Role-based Access Control; Security technology; USA Councils; Vulnerability assessments; Access control"

These protection mechanisms often follow a secured layered approach, called defense in depth (DiD), which allow these organizations to have a more secured network based on security mechanisms at different areas of their network design. Defense in depth is the concept of protecting a computer network with a series of defensive mechanisms such that if one mechanism fails, another will already be in place to thwart an attack. Because there are so many potential attackers with such a wide variety of attack methods available, there is no single method for successfully protecting a computer network. Utilizing the strategy of defense in depth will reduce the risk of having a successful-and likely very costly-attack on a network. In today's environment there is more of a need than ever for increased security in enterprise level networks. Companies are finding themselves with offices around the world and needing a way to provide an affordable high speed secure communications between them as well as provide ways to implement wireless technologies in a secured environment.

In response to these threats, sites must perform extensive intrusion monitoring. This intrusion monitoring can have significant costs in terms of bandwidth, computing power, storage space, and licensing fees. Furthermore, when exploits are detected, the victims must take actions that can consume further resources and compromise their objectives (e.g., by reducing e-commerce server throughput). In this paper, we explore techniques for modeling the costs and benefits of various security monitoring and response actions. Given these models and stochastic expectations about the types of attacks that a site is likely to face, our CIRCADIA (cooperative intelligent real-time control architecture for dynamic information assurance) automatic security control system is able to make real-time tradeoffs between the level of safety and security that is enforced, and the level of system resources/performance that are applied to the main computational objectives (e.g., e-commerce transactions). We show how CIRCADIA is able to dynamically adjust its security activities to account for changing threat profiles and objectives. The result: a continually-optimized balance of security-maintaining activity that reduces risk while still allowing the system to meet its goals. © 2003 IEEE.","","Electronic commerce; Real time control; Safety engineering; Stochastic systems; Costs and benefits; Dynamic information; E-commerce servers; E-commerce transactions; Intelligent real time control; Security activities; Security control systems; Security monitoring; Stochastic models"

Active networks provide a much more flexible network infrastructure than traditional networks do. Flexibility is a powerful merit of active networks, but it can raise considerable security problems. Current active network researches have applied diverse techniques to solve them. Cryptography is one way of protecting active networks. However it should not be applied conventionally, since the active network paradigm is different from the traditional one. It means that, in active network environments, active packets containing programmable codes should perform computations at intermediate-nodes as well as end-nodes. That is, since the packet sending-node does not know the intermediate receiving-node, it cannot apply traditional cryptographic techniques that can process each other only between end-nodes. The paper proposes a secure method for transferring active packets and performing computations using a transformed digital signature schemes with message recovery, in an active network environment in which intermediate packet receiving-nodes are not fixed. The proposed scheme uses a modified public key digital signature scheme in which signing/verifying key pairs have almost the same bit length and the verification-key storing server plays the role of key management server. © 2003 IEEE.","Computer networks; Data flow computing; Digital signatures; Information security; Network servers; Protection; Public key; Public key cryptography; Quality of service; Routing","Active networks; Authentication; Computer networks; Cryptography; Electronic document identification systems; Network architecture; Public key cryptography; Quality of service; Security of data; Servers; Data flow computing; Network server; Protection; Public keys; Routing; Network security"

In this paper, we propose a speaker verification method based on a speech coding scheme in the digital transmission systems. The proposed method utilizes CELP (Code Excited Linear Prediction) parameters which are used in speech coding schemes for mobile communication systems or IP networks, and verifies a speaker only with the encoded speech. The merits of the proposed method are as follows; 1 Speaker verification is easily realized in the current mobile terminals or network systems by adding a little function. 2 Since CELP parameters contain a speaker's characteristics of articulation, text-independent speaker verification is realized.

The ability to establish business relations inside the company as well as with other companies in a secure way is important for the operability of business in today's world; corporate PKIs may implement different architectures, security policies, and cryptographic suites in order to accomplish this goal. But communication beyond the PKI is established with other companies based on a trust relationship (B2B), which brings vulnerability provided by PKIs from different companies. A flexible mechanism is needed to link these corporate PKIs and translate corporate relationships with security mechanisms and policies. This is accomplished through a Password Authentication Protocol (PAK), which provides means to authenticate or validate users across Bridge Certification Authorities (BCA), where certificates authorities (CA) are limited and cannot reach over to the other side of the BCA. In such a way, PAK can guarantee authentication of end points without modifying the original PKI structure of companies and offer flexibility in the process of implementation. Additional to this, there are several other issues that must be solved; such as the ability to connect different company PKI without compromising any sensible information that might cause a conflict of commercial interests and still guarantee a certain level of security through an accreditation and validation of the parties in order to be certain with whom we are doing business. In order to achieve accreditation and validation of PKIs and not expose any sensible information that could compromise either parties, we also based our work on a zero-knowledge security protocol, letting each PKI continue with their security policies without having to adjust to specific needs, achieving a better security level of commercial transactions through such hardening process. © 2003 IEEE.","Accreditation; Authentication; Bridges; Business; Certification; Companies; Information security; Joining processes; Protocols; Public key","Accreditation; Bridges; Cybernetics; Distributed computer systems; Hardening; Industry; Network protocols; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Security systems; Telecommunication networks; Virtual private networks; Bridge certification authority; Certification; Commercial transactions; Joining process; Password authentication protocols; Public key infrastructure; Public keys; Zero knowledge proof; Authentication"

Bandwidth limitations limit the amount of UMV intelligence and status information that can be telemetered back to the controller. Instead of raw data, models of the data are developed onboard the UMV, enabling communication of complex information within short time lines and small bandwidth.

The amount of collected information is often more than can be effectively and efficiently understood by humans. Therefore, today's decision-makers have become reliant upon information systems to filter through the information and fuse that information into a computer representation of the battle space. The degree of reliance placed in these systems by the decision-makers suggests a significant level of trust. Trust theories and models are rich in the literature, but few have been developed for the human-computer trust relationship. A recent model of trust was found that was both broad in scope and supportive of human-computer trust theories. This model was used to explore the decision-maker's trust in information systems in a C2 environment. Given the vulnerability of information systems to information security incidents such as hacking and data manipulation, this study set out to examine if the presence of such incidents would effect the decision-makers trusting behavior. This study also examined if the use of such external safeguards, such as the computer emergency response teams (CERT) and the network risk assessment certifications, would affect the decision-maker. Two laboratory experiments were conducted with military personnel using a high-fidelity C2. The findings from both experiments suggest that the presence of information security incidents in a fast-paced C2 environment have no effect on the decision-makers trusting behavior. Decision-makers continued to trust information systems even though information security incidents occurred. © 2003 IEEE.","","Command and control systems; Complex networks; Information systems; Military applications; Network security; Personal computing; Risk assessment; Security of data; Trusted computing; Amount of information; Command and control (C2); Computer emergency response teams; Human information systems; Information security incidents; Information warfare; Laboratory experiments; Military personnels; Decision making"

This however presents serious security challenges in pervasive environments such as wirelessly-connected hospitals; where protecting the confidentiality of the information, while at the same time allowing authorized user to access it conveniently is the core issue in the paradigm. We describe the security challenges in pervasive computing environments, and explain why traditional security mechanisms fail to meet the demands of these environments. We use an architecture that incorporates policy based security and distributed trust management to provide a highly flexible approach for accessing electronic patient records that are electronically reacted depending on the users digital credentials.

Inspired by the solution of knight-tour problem (KTP), a new algorithm is presented for scrambling the details of images, which consists of two stages: computation of the knight-tour matrixes (KTM) and transformation of the image scrambling by using KTM. For the purpose of computing KTM, an intelligent searching-intelligent backtracking (ISIB) algorithm, which overcomes the shortages of the traditional searching-backtracking algorithm and improves the efficiency of computing KTM, is proposed. The details of image are blurred and the information of texts is hidden into image by using our algorithm. The experiments show that the image is approximately invariable in collectivity and it seems to be degraded by some noises. Therefore, the scrambled image does not easily stimulate other people's desire of trying to decrypt it. By means of this, the security of image and the information hidden into it are increased. This is propitious to transmitting security of image details and confidential texts.","Image scrambling tranformation; Image security; Knight-tour matrix; Knight-tour problem","Algorithms; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Data privacy; Image quality; Mathematical transformations; Security of data; Text processing; Digital image hiding; Intelligent searching-intelligent backtracking algorithm; Knight-tour matrix; Knight-tour problem; Knight-tour scrambling algorithm; Searching backtracking algorithm; Image processing"

Unfortunately, some of these intermediate nodes might be malicious, forming a threat to the security or confidentiality of exchanged data. While data encryption can protect the content exchanged between nodes, analysis of communication patterns may reveal valuable information about end users and their relationships. Using anonymous paths for communication provides security and privacy against traffic analysis. To establish these anonymous paths, all nodes build a global view of the network by exchanging routing information. In dynamic ad hoc networks, building this global view is not an option.

In this paper, we present Pulse, a new class of super-worms, which target network systems and specifically routers, in contrast to conventional worms and super-worms which target network hosts. Pulse super-worms can be very effective and efficient, because they exploit one significant Internet vulnerability: the assumption of Internet's development model that all routers are trustworthy and can coordinate to defend against attacks from external enemies, who have been considered the only enemies traditionally. Pulse super-worms infect routers, thus creating internal enemies undefeatable using the existing security model. As we demonstrate, Pulse super-worms are more efficient than alternatives in infecting network systems and utilize available information for self-organizing their infection policy. Furthermore, we demonstrate through specific attack scenarios, that Pulse super-worms can be extremely effective for a wide range of attacks, especially in information warfare.

Confidentiality and integrity policies can be expressed by annotating programs with security types that constrain information flow; these programs can then be partitioned automatically to run securely on heterogeneously trusted hosts. The resulting communicating subprograms collectively implement the original program, yet the system as a whole satisfies the security requirements of participating principals without requiring a universally trusted host machine. The experience in applying this methodology and the performance of the resulting distributed code suggest that this is a promising way to obtain secure distributed computation.

The MD5 and RSA algorithms will be applied to code-strings containing code-blocks to generate encrypted sign messages. These messages will be hidden in the blocks.

US initiatives include creating a series of industry-specific Information Sharing and Analysis Centers to encourage government/industry collaboration on information security. Private sector firms also need stronger incentives to invest adequately in IT security. Moving from trust management to risk management, with widely available and well-functioning markets for insurance covering IT security risks, could go a long way toward strengthening such incentives. Although the insurance industry has developed new forms of cyber insurance, coverage is limited, and few businesses now purchase these policies. Problems include lack of underwriting standards, little experience on which to base premiums, numerous exclusions and limits on liability, and an underdeveloped reinsurance market. Possible ways for government to spur insurance market expansion are explored, such as participating in standards development, mandating cyber insurance, facilitating reinsurance, or indemnifying catastrophic losses. In the end, rewarding IT security in the marketplace will likely require legislative changes to define liabilities more clearly and relate them to risk management principles and practices. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

One of the unsolved problems of security engineering is the adoption of measures or metrics that can reliably depict the assurance associated with a specific hardware and software system. This paper reports on a recent attempt to focus requirements in this area by examining those currently in use. It then suggests a categorization of information assurance (IA) metrics that may be tailored to an organization's needs. We believe that the provision of security mechanisms in systems is a subset of the systems engineering discipline having a large software-engineering correlation. There is general agreement that no single system metric or any ""one-prefect"" set of IA metrics applies across all systems or audiences. The set most useful for an organization largely depends on their IA goals, their technical, organizational and operational needs, and the financial, personnel, and technical resources that are available. © 2003 IEEE.","","Software engineering; Engineering correlations; Engineering disciplines; Information assurance; Security engineering; Security mechanism; State of practice; Technical resources; Unsolved problems; Network security"

All of them are developed as ciphers' extension or enhancement tool to gain better security or additional features. NITS had defined 5 modes as the standards; they are ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR mode. Among these modes, the CTR mode is the one that capable to be fully parallelized and possess more security features. However the disadvantage in the implementation of CTR mode is the deviation of the counter value between the encryptor and decryptor. The synchronization of the counter value can be easily lost during delivery or transmission, hence affecting the integrity of the system. This paper proposed a method to eliminate the synchronization issue by calculating the initial counter value from the initial value. The new counter value is calculated using an algorithm comprises of the cipher algorithm and a hash algorithm.

The ideas are an extension of earlier efforts to base analysis of information assurance for complex systems on system partitioning into a system of systems. The approach discussed rests upon the notion that the system at hand is intended to achieve some useful purpose and that a system of systems approach provides a feasible methodology for composing the system functionality (behaviors) as an aggregation of sub-systems functionality. Many subsystem processes have continuous process models while higher system models are usually discrete. Composition of components requires consideration of interaction of subsystems, especially when feedback loops are present. A model of information assurance (IA) processes consistent with this hybrid system model of complex processes is described. Information dominance is defined as superior situation understanding and superior support for making decisions under uncertainty. The information dominance model is then presented as an extension of the AI model. The paper concludes with a conjecture that more effective intrusion detection can be achieved by using the known purpose of an information system (e.g. achieving information dominance in support of an operation) to guide allocation of intrusion detection resources. © 2003 IEEE.","Hybrid Systems; Information Assurance; Information Dominance","Hybrid systems; Industrial plants; Mercury (metal); System of systems; Systems engineering; Composition of components; Continuous process; Hybrid system models; Information assurance; Information dominance; Situation understanding; System functionality; System partitioning; Intrusion detection"

In this paper, the file system PNFS (Proxy/Private Network File System), which makes file sharing based on NFS easy between different administrative domains, is proposed. With PNFS, a user can share files of a server that has his account without intervention of its administrator. Although, in general, a decrease in security occurs when intervention of an administrator is omitted, security is enhanced by encryption and the like by the PNFS. In addition, the efficacy of the proposed system has been verified by performance evaluation of a prototype system, which shows a practically sufficient throughput even with simultaneous accesses from a multiple number of clients.","Distributed file system; File sharing per user; Information security; Multiple administrative domains; NFS; Secure file sharing","Administrative data processing; Cryptography; File organization; Internet; Network protocols; Security of data; UNIX; Wide area networks; Distributed file system; File sharing; Message authentication; Multiple administrative domains; Proxy-private network file system; Client server computer systems"

After careful analysis and comparison of several proposed alternatives, a sequential security coordination scheme that is based on two sets of coordination information is recommended. Under this scheme the upper-level and lower-level power market can cooperate smoothly for the system security, and potential power exchanges among lower-level markets can be greatly boosted.

The conventional approach to (corporate) information management, security, and its associated systems has conventionally been narrow, protective and a reactive. However, this paper argues that information security is a part of the information management (rather than the security) function. The contemporary concept of Information Warfare has developed the concept of information as a 'target' and that of a' weapon'. This means an aggressive and dynamic organisational change in the use of information and associated systems. This requires a change in mindset. An integrated information strategy requires an integrated perspective on security (a protective paradigm) and intelligence (an aggressive paradigm). This paper argues that courses for information professionals of the future should integrate these worldviews in their education. A post-graduate course being implemented at an Australian university will be offered as an example. © 2003 by Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Education; Information security training; Information superiority; Information warfare; Intelligence training","Information management; Information services; Security of data; Conventional approach; Information professionals; Information security trainings; Information superiority; Information warfare; Integrated informations; Integrating information; Organisational change; Education"

Current statistics show that a computer is infected with a virus at each 10-12 hours period. Unauthorized accesses to personal records or organization's sensitive information are common cyber attacks. Cyber security concerns everybody from home users to state and local governments to specific industry sectors. There is a need for the increase use of automated auditing and intelligent reporting mechanisms that must support security assessment and threat management. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques for improving security management processes including tools such Intrusion Detection Systems. The paper discusses an intelligent model for cyber attack detection and prevention. The adaptive model is based on various Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, and Expert Knowledge-based Systems, Data Mining, and Intelligent Databases as well as traditional statistical approaches. The intelligent model supports user by providing useful feedback before an attack occurred. Copyright © (2003) by the International Society for Computers and Their Applications.

Disputes in the real world are resolved in various ways. Similarly, in the virtual world, there is a variety of non-repudiation services as defined in the ISO/IEC standards [5, 6, 7, 8]. Whatever actions are taken, evidence is the key to the successful conduct of these services. These previous works usually define the concept of non-repudiation services using a single piece of evidence, which fails to describe the causality of an event completely. In business, no activity is atomic, and evidence therefore does not exist as an atomic piece. Rather, evidence exists in the form of a series of relevant pieces of evidence. That is, we must consider a series of activities-formed onto a cycle of value transfers. This paper introduces a chain-of-evidence concept to electronic commerce as a basis for the refinement of the pertinent international standards. The chain of evidence can be analyzed and derived from the cyclic model of value transfers. From information security and information processing perspectives, this paper aims to provide a better evidence-management methodology as the first step to be taken in settling any disputes. As a result, we expect that the research will contribute a theoretical basis for non-repudiation services in the practical world. © 2003 by Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cycle of value transfers; Disputes resolution; Electronic commerce; Evidence management; Non-repudiation services","Data processing; Electronic commerce; Security of data; Virtual reality; Chain of evidence; Evidence management; International standards; ISO/IEC standard; Non-repudiation services; Value transfers; Virtual worlds; Chains"

Furthermore, the automation of individual exploits for computer security attack now raises the specter of large-scale attacks that will occur too quickly for human defenders to react. To counter these high-speed, automated attacks, Honeywell Laboratories is developing a unique computer defense system that automatically and adaptively responds to net intruders. The Cooperative Intelligent Real-Time Control Architecture for Dynamic Information Assurance (CIRCADIA) will provide local, low-cost, autonomic defenses for computing resources by intelligently adapting threat monitoring systems and automatically responding to security threats in real time. Most importantly, CIRCADIA will use control-theoretic methods to automatically synthesize its control strategies, rather than relying on hand-built rules or other knowledge. CIRCADIA is built on the foundation of the CIRCA architecture for intelligent realtime control systems. CIRCA automatically synthesizes and executes hard-real-time discrete event control systems for embedded applications. CIRCADIA can be thought of as a specialization of CIRCA, tailored to the computer security domain. © 2003 IEEE.","Automatic control; Automation; Computer architecture; Computer security; Control system synthesis; Control systems; Information systems; Intelligent control; Large-scale systems; Real time systems","Automation; Computer architecture; Computer control; Computer control systems; Control; Control system synthesis; Control systems; Embedded systems; Information systems; Intelligent control; Interactive computer systems; Large scale systems; Real time control; Real time systems; Security of data; Security systems; Automated attacks; Computing resource; Control strategies; Dynamic information; Embedded application; Intelligent real time control; Large-scale attacks; Monitoring system; Discrete time control systems"

Rather, it depends on a complex interplay among technology, organizational and managerial issues, and events in the external environment. Senior management attention, training, and sound operating procedures are just as important as firewalls and virtual private networks in arriving at a robust security posture. In this paper, we represent the interactions among these technical and organizational drivers using the system dynamics methodology, to develop a high level model of organizational information security. Since the basic system dynamics construct is the feedback loop, our model is able to expose the counteracting mechanics that work to reinforce and erode security, respectively. By doing so, it can inform the process of crafting an appropriate level of security—a problem facing most organizations. Since the model is based on simulation, it is also possible to test what-if scenarios of how the security posture of the organization would fare under different levels of external threats and management policies. © 2003, Association for Information Systems.

The policy engines of different coalition members will be expected to share information in order to enable cross-network access as dictated by coalition policy. The current paper features a coalition of networks, each with its internal policy upheld by its own policy engine.

Recent trends in protecting applications use operating systems as only the first layer of security, anticipating that this layer may be breached. Another layer is added to react to and repair the damage done by intruders that succeed in breaching the first layer. A promising approach to designing the second layer of protection uses adaptive middleware to enable agile behavior and to coordinate protective responses across the distributed system, even in resource-depleted environments. This new approach to protection complements more traditional approaches - in which only one layer of security is used - by hardening critical components at multiple system levels. When integrated effectively, this multi-level approach makes it harder for intruders to corrupt or disable distributed systems and applications. This paper presents three contributions to the study of protecting distributed applications against malicious behavior. First, we describe the key ideas and technologies behind the emerging multi-level approach to protecting distributed applications. Second, we explain how these ideas relate to security engineering in general. Finally, we report recent results in evaluating a collection of technologies that implement this approach. These results reinforce the premise that an adaptive middleware approach to increasing survival time and enabling applications to operate through attacks is feasible, though much additional research remains to be done. © 2003 by Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptive middleware; Distributed systems; Information assurance; Quality of service; Security; Survivability","Computer hardware description languages; e-government; Middleware; Quality of service; Adaptive middleware; Distributed systems; Information assurance; Security; Survivability; Network security"

Indeed, it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on video/audio conversations, or intercept and modify data packets. Anyone with a PC and access to the public network has the ability to capture network traffic, potentially compromising the privacy and the reliability of the applications. Hence, it is mandatory for wireless applications to guarantee authentication, confidentiality and integrity of data.

These include performance, reliability and security. Although grid middleware can address some of these issues on a wider scale, it has also become imperative to ensure adequate service provision at local level. Load sharing in clusters can contribute to the provision of high quality service, by exploiting both static and dynamic information. This paper is concerned with the presentation of a load sharing scheme, which can satisfy grid computing requirements. It follows a proactive, non preemptive and distributed approach. Load information is gathered continuously before it is needed, and a task is allocated to the most appropriate node for execution. Performance and reliability are enhanced by the decentralized nature of the scheme and the symmetric roles of the nodes. In addition, the scheme exhibits transparency characteristics that facilitate integration with the grid. © 2003 IEEE.","Availability; Computer architecture; Computer science; Context-aware services; Grid computing; Information security; Middleware; Processor scheduling; Quality of service; Testing","Availability; Computer architecture; Computer science; Expert systems; Information services; Middleware; Quality of service; Security of data; Testing; Context aware services; Distributed approaches; Dynamic information; High quality service; Load-sharing scheme; Performance and reliabilities; Processor scheduling; Service provisions; Grid computing"

This form of digital copyrighting has become an important issue in the area of Information Assurance. Historically, human perceptibility has been exploited to hide watermarks in multi-media (audio, video, imagery, text) but recently, researchers have attempted to imbed invisible watermarks into relational data. Unlike multi-media, relational watermarking methods must hide the watermark in a way that does not change the basic usefulness of the data in terms of query processing. Early results have shown that there are several open issues in this area that need addressing. In this paper we make the argument that spatial data, in the form of remotely sensed images (RSI), does not fit easily into either the digital imagery or relational database domain when attempting watermarking for copyright protection and that much more research is needed in this area.

A holistic approach requires that the focus of management should rather be on minimising overall risk exposure as opposed to ""tick-off"" security safeguards on a checklist. The holistic management of information security requires a well-established Information Security Management System (ISMS). An ISMS addresses all aspects in an organisation that deals with creating and maintaining a secure information environment. Aspects such as policies, standards, guidelines, codes-of- practice, technology, human, legal and ethics issues all from part of an ISMS. Organisations can opt for different approaches to establishing an ISMS. One way is to implement the controls as contained in a standard or code-of- practice, such as ISO 17799. In this case information security is driven from a management process point of view and referred to as ""process security"". Another approach that also complement or add to process security, is to use certified products in the IT infrastructure environment when possible. The approach here focuses on technical issues and is referred to as ""product security"". The 'process' ISMS and the 'product' ISMS approaches are only two ways to address information security, each from a different perspective. The question that arises is whether the 'process' ISMS and the 'product' ISMS can be combined into a more holistic ISMS and what the impact of the one will be on the other. The aim of this paper is.to propose an ISMS that combines ""process security"" and ""product security"". © 2003 by Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Certification; Certified products; Code of practice; Controls; Evaluation criteria; Guideline; Information security management system; Process evaluation; Product evaluation; Protection classes; Self-assessment; Standards","Codes (symbols); Control engineering; Industrial management; Risk management; Security of data; Standards; Certification; Certified products; Code of practice; Evaluation criteria; Guideline; Information security management systems; Process Evaluation; Product evaluation; Protection classes; Self assessment; Information management"

These systems are becoming difficult to comprehend and the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance are far from straightforward. To facilitate improved analysis and design methods for these systems, the security-level of systems need to be assessed with a greater precision than currently possible. For this purpose, a set of IT security-relevant system characteristics is required. Furthermore, identification of security-relevant characteristics is needed to support the formulation of adequate modeling techniques and the security requirements engineering processes. We describe an effort to find such a set of characteristics. The resulting set of characteristics contributes to all three tasks discussed above. To build the set of characteristics, four tasks (a literature study, a structured analysis, a brainstorm session, and a crosscheck) have been performed. The results include an initial set of security-relevant characteristics for distributed information systems and a structuring of the identified characteristics. © 2003 IEEE.","Command and control systems; Communication system security; Control systems; Design methodology; Distributed information systems; Information security; Intelligent networks; Performance analysis; Protection; Reconnaissance","Control system analysis; Control systems; Cybernetics; Distributed computer systems; Information systems; Intelligent networks; Requirements engineering; Security of data; Security systems; Communication system security; Design Methodology; Distributed information systems; Performance analysis; Protection; Reconnaissance; Command and control systems"

CORBA systems are one of the potential middleware architectures that can be supported by the architecture.

Analysing social risk assessment shows us that the latter issue needs more attention. Moreover, autonomous decisions about risk as well as experience gathering are relevant factors of social risk assessment. IT systems therefore need to include appropriate features in order to comply with these factors. The paper explains how these features can be identified using requirements analysis, starting from the social goals. Ten highly reusable socio-technical criteria can be derived from social goals during this process. Complying features especially support responses of the social system in case of a technical system disturbance. © 2003 IEEE.","Access control; Design engineering; Information analysis; Information security; Risk analysis; Risk management; System analysis and design; Systems engineering and theory; Usability","Access control; Information analysis; Information management; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security of data; Autonomous decision; Damage probability; Design Engineering; Requirements analysis; System analysis and design; Systems engineering and theories; Technical systems; Usability; Risk assessment"

One of the major sources of inefficiency in supply-chain management is information asymmetry; i.e., information that is available to one or more organizations in the chain (e.g., manufacturer, retailer) is not available to others. There are several causes of information asymmetry, among them fear that a powerful buyer or supplier will take advantage of private information, that information will leak to a competitor, etc. We propose secure supply-chain collaboration (SSCC) protocols that enable supply-chain partners to cooperatively achieve desired system-wide goals without revealing the private information of any of the parties, even though the jointly computed decisions require the information of all the parties. Secure supply-chain collaboration has the potential to improve supply-chain management practice, and by removing a major inefficiency therein, improves productivity. We present specific SSCC protocols for two types of supply-chain interactions: capacity allocation, and e-auctions (electronic auctions). In the course of doing so, we design techniques that are of independent interest, and are likely to be useful in the design of future SSCC protocols. © 2003 IEEE.","Collaboration; Contracts; Cryptographic protocols; Government; Information security; Inventory management; National security; Resource management; Supply chain management; Supply chains","Commerce; Contracts; Curricula; Electronic commerce; Information management; Inventory control; National security; Security of data; Supply chains; Collaboration; Cryptographic protocols; Government; Inventory management; Resource management; Supply chain management"

However, simply providing training and awareness does not ensure that users will always use safe practices.

Well-typed programs obey a generalization of noninterference that ensures immunity to internal timing attacks and to attacks that exploit information about the thread scheduler. Elimination of these refinement attacks is possible because the enforced security property extends noninterference with observational determinism.

In this paper, we discuss security and safety issues in medical environment, the technology, types, and characteristics of sensors, and research issues in smart antennas, denial of service, fault tolerant authentication, privacy issues, and energy considerations. A discussion of sensors in patient rooms, clinics/wards, hospitals, and measurements of safety and security is presented. The available devices for sensor and wireless communication are also briefly included. © 2003 IEEE.","Biosensors; Chemical and biological sensors; Communication system security; Data security; Information security; Intelligent sensors; Patient monitoring; Sensor phenomena and characterization; Wireless communication; Wireless sensor networks","Biosensors; Computer crime; Denial-of-service attack; Expert systems; Medical computing; Patient monitoring; Safety engineering; Security of data; Telecommunication networks; Transmission control protocol; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Chemical and biological sensors; Communication system security; Computer Information Systems; Energy considerations; Intelligent sensors; Safety and securities; Technical challenges; Wireless communications; Network security"

One approach to overcoming the problem of spoofing is the use of multimodal biometric fusion. Most current research is focused on overcoming the deficiencies of a single biometric trait or reducing the false acceptance rate, both without any emphasis on the false rejection rate. Multimodal biometric fusion combines measurements from different biometric traits to enhance the strengths and diminish the weaknesses of the individual measurements. We investigate two types of errors associated with biometrics. The accuracy is analyzed for multimodal biometric systems utilizing two commonly used fusion rules.

To perform their functions correctly, guards must contain data release and sanitization rules that accurately reflect the reclassification or declassification requirements to move data across information security boundaries. The current guards, however, require considerable technical skill to express release and sanitization rules, which data producers typically do not possess. Another limitation of the current guards is that once the data passes through a guard, all access control requirements to that data is lost.

CapWIN is a diverse mixture of public and private networks that share information in order to provide public safety and transportation services for metropolitan Washington, DC. It is imperative that the members of integrated systems such as CapWIN be aware of the security status of the other participants in order to anticipate security breaches and respond accordingly. As of now, there are few means by which the members of such systems can obtain real-time information pertaining to the security status of all other participating parties. The system presented here integrates these disparate agencies by utilizing existing security information available from each agency within the enterprise. © 2003 Univesity of Virginia.","Communication system security; Computer security; Data security; Information security; Intrusion detection; Monitoring; Real time systems; Safety; Systems engineering and theory; Transportation","Accident prevention; Interactive computer systems; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Monitoring; Real time systems; Safety engineering; Security of data; Transportation; Capital wireless integration networks; Communication system security; Integrated systems; Public Safety Networks; Real-time information; Security monitoring; Systems engineering and theories; Transportation services; Network security"

Different types of events have different levels of importance for the user. Information Assurance is an ability to disseminate different information at different assurance levels to the end-user. The assurance level is determined by the criticality of the sensed phenomenon. Thus, information assurance capability allows a sensor network to deliver critical information with high assurance albeit potentially at a higher cost, while saving energy by delivering less important information at a lower assurance level. In this paper, we look at the problem of efficient information assurance in sensor networks when the assurance level of information is defined as the probability of information delivery (desired reliability) to the sink. We propose a new scheme for information delivery at a desired reliability using hop-by-hop broadcast. We show how the wireless broadcast can be utilized to increase the packet delivery rate at each hop and attain a desired reliability at minimal cost. Finally, we derive the optimal strategy for allocation of desired reliabilities at each hop in order to attain any given desired end-to-end reliability.","Information Assurance; Reliability; Sensor Networks; Wireless Broadcast","Algorithms; Data communication systems; Information dissemination; Network protocols; Packet switching; Quality of service; Wireless telecommunication systems; Information assurance; Sensor networks; Wireless broadcast; Sensor data fusion"

In this paper, we focus on the covert channels using identification field of IP header and the sequence number field of TCP header.

Prompt action by DNS server operators minimized the duration and impact of the attack, which had little effect on overall Internet performance. Intrusion detection systems are researched and developed to detect attacks from outside world since 1980. Intrusion detection systems create an alert data or log data when detect an intrusion. But Many IDS uses heterogeneous data set, so these data must be mapped to another format. IDWG in IETF proposed IDMEF. This paper designs an alert data format compatible IDMEF. The secure networking framework is consisted of SGS and CPCS. SGS acts as an intrusion detection system on edge of network ingress point, and CPCS acts as a higher-level server. SGS makes an alert data compatible IDMEF and sends it to CPCS. CPCS parses an IDMEF alert data and makes an alert object for using correlation analysis. SGS can see its area only, but CPCS can see wide network area. CPCS can detect more complex attacks as well as support integrated management through cooperating each other. In the view of alert processing we converted raw alert data to Ladon-alert data to support interoperability. We use IDMEF-compatible alert datat structure. We have designed and developed integrated IDS on gateway, and security control server on higher-level class. Then this framework offers cooperative intrusion detection, policy based controlling. © 2003 IEEE.","Cities and towns; Computer science; Data security; Electronic mail; Information security; Intelligent networks; Intrusion detection; Network servers; Web and internet services; Web server","Complex networks; Computer crime; Computer science; Denial-of-service attack; Electronic mail; Gateways (computer networks); Intelligent networks; Internet; Interoperability; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Security of data; Servers; Web services; Cities and towns; Cooperative intrusion detection; Distributed denial of service attack; Integrated management; Internet services; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network server; Web servers; Network security"

A system violating the perfect secrecy conditions can leak mission critical information. Second, we suggest statistical pattern recognition as a fundamental technology to test an information system's security. This technology can cover a large category of testing approaches because of statistical pattern recognition's maturity and abundant techniques. Third, researchers have proposed traffic padding as countermeasures to traffic analysis attacks. By applying the proposed information assurance testing framework, we find that constant rate traffic padding does not satisfy Shannon's perfect secrecy conditions because of its implementation mechanism. We design a variant rate traffic padding strategy as an alternative, which is validated by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. © 2003 IEEE.","Computer science; Contracts; Cryptography; Information analysis; Information security; Mission critical systems; Pattern recognition; Payloads; Protection; System testing","Computer science; Contracts; Cryptography; Cybernetics; Information analysis; Pattern recognition; Security of data; Implementation mechanisms; Information assurance; Mission critical systems; Payloads; Protection; Statistical pattern recognition; System testing; Traffic analysis attacks; Pattern recognition systems"

As such, any attempt to address security concerns in a software system must, of necessity, be global in nature, and security solutions must be applied consistently at every relevant location. One way of achieving these objectives is by separating out security concerns from the rest of the application issues, such that they can be addressed independently and applied globally. A methodology that would encompass these two high-level goals: separation of security concerns and consistent implementation of security solutions, would pave the road towards secure applications. To implement such a methodology, we chose to use the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm. AOP is a relatively new programming model that enables the separation of cross-cutting concerns while remaining easy to use and integrating well with the development process. We describe a framework, based on the AOP model, for implementing security solutions in a globally consistent manner such that security concerns are modularized. © 2003 IEEE.","Application software; Communication system security; Computer industry; Defense industry; Government; Information security; Military communication; Mission critical systems; Object oriented modeling; Software systems","Application programs; Aspect oriented programming; Computer software; Military communications; Security of data; Separation; Communication system security; Computer industry; Defense Industry; Government; Mission critical systems; Object oriented model; Software systems; Object oriented programming"

This article introduces a distributed model for security based on biological paradigms of epidemiology and immunology. In this model each node in the network has an immune system that identifies and destroys pathogens in the incoming network traffic as well as files resident on the node. The network nodes present a collective defense to the pathogens by working symbiotically and sharing pathogen information with each other. Each node compiles a list of pathogens that are perceived as threats by using information provided from all the nodes in the network. The signatures for these pathogens are incorporated into the detector population of the immune systems to increase the probability of detection. Critical to the success of this system is the detection scheme, which should not only be accurate but also efficient. Three separate schemes for detecting pathogens are examined, namely, contiguous string matching, Hamming distance, and Kolmogorov Complexity. This work provides a model of the system and examines the efficiency of different detection schemes. A simulation model is built to study the sensitivity of model parameters, such as signature length, sampling rate, and network topology, to detection of pathogens. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Epidemiology; Immunology; Information assurance; Kolmogorov Complexity; Signature matching",""

The notion of accessing diverse and autonomous information repositories with different APIs is not accepted. This has necessitated the logical integration of diverse information from different sources with common APIs.

The concept of mobility, however, introduces additional complexities and restrictions to multi-database designers. A user accessing data through a remote connection with a portable device has high probability to face issues like reduced capacity network connections, frequent disconnections, and processing and resource restrictions.

This paper investigates the deceptive tactics available on the Internet and some of the factors that make them more or less likely to be adopted. An established theory of deception is applied to the Internet context to identify the deception tactics available on-line. The theory is then expanded with new hypotheses that link the selection of a specific tactic to the identity of the target and the purported identity of the deceiver. Content analysis of a broad range of documentary evidence published between 1995 and 2000 is used to build a database of 201 cases of Internet deception. Data from the database are used to test the hypotheses. The results suggest that deceivers select tactics as a function of their targets as well as their own purported identities.

The attacks are classified by their target properties. The analysis shows that the on-demand route query enables the malicious host to conduct real time attacks on AODV. False distance vector and false destination sequence attacks are studied by simulation. Two connection scenarios are considered: common destination and uniformly distributed traffic load. The delivery ratio, attack overhead, and the propagation of false routes are measured by varying the number of connections and the mobility of the hosts. The simulation results illustrate that the attacker can confuse the network connectivity with false routes and lead to a decrease in the delivery ratio of up to 75%. When the hosts are uniformly distributed, the false distance vector attacks cannot cheat more than half of the hosts, but the false destination sequence routes can propagate to most of the network. The anomaly patterns of sequence numbers carried by routing request (RREQ) can be applied to detect the false destination sequence attacks. The vulnerability analysis results and anomaly patterns can be employed by other ad hoc routing protocols to establish intrusion prevention and detection mechanisms. © 2003 IEEE.","Ad hoc networks; Analytical models; Authentication; Computational modeling; Information security; Mobile computing; Network topology; Protection; Routing protocols; Switches","Ad hoc networks; Analytical models; Authentication; Electric network topology; Intrusion detection; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network protocols; Network security; Routers; Security of data; Switches; Vectors; Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector Protocols; Ad hoc on demand distance vector routing protocols; Ad hoc routing protocol; Analysis and simulation; Computational model; Network topology; Protection; Vulnerability analysis; Routing protocols"

Since malicious packets often disguise their sensitive information in one way or another in order to bypass the packet filter, this paper proposes a high-speed discrete content sensitive pattern match algorithm for imperceptible deep packet filtering. The filter sets up and manages (including lookup and update) a sensitive information database, monitors both packet header and payload at line speed with hardware-based discrete content sensitive pattern match, and then executes the corresponding action. The paper mainly discusses a TCAM (ternary content addressable memory)-based pattern match algorithm as well as the architecture and performance analysis of a packet filtering system based on this algorithm.

Despite steady improvements in microprocessor and system performance, private-key cipher implementations continue to be slow. Irrespective of the cipher used, the main reason for the low performance is lack of parallelism, which fundamentally comes from encryption modes such as the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. In CBC, each plaintext block is XOR'ed with the previous ciphertext block and then encrypted, essentially inducing a tight recurrence through the ciphertext blocks. To deliver high performance while maintaining high level of security assurance in real systems, the cryptography community has proposed Interleaved Cipher Block Chaining (ICBC) mode. In four-way interleaved chaining, the first, fifth, and every fourth block thereafter are encrypted in CBC mode; the second, sixth, and every fourth block thereafter are encrypted as another stream, and so on. Thus, interleaved chaining loosens the recurrence imposed by CBC, enabling the multiple encryption streams to be overlapped. The number of interleaved chains can be chosen to balance performance and adequate chaining to get good data diffusion. While ICBC was originally proposed to improve hardware encryption rates by employing multiple encryption chips in parallel, this is the first paper to evaluate ICBC via multithreading commonly-used ciphers on a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP). ICBC allows exploiting the full processing power of SMPs, which spend many cycles in cryptographic processing as medium-scale servers today, and will do so as chip-multiprocessor clients in the future. Using the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel II, we show that our multithreaded ciphers achieve encryption rates of 92 Mbytes/s on a 16-processor SMP at 1 GHz, reaching a factor of almost 10 improvement oiler a uniprocessor, which achieves 9 Mbytes/s. © 2003 IEEE.","Acceleration; High performance computing; Information security; Microprocessors; Modems; Multithreading; Parallel processing; Public key; Public key cryptography; System performance","Acceleration; Blockchain; Microprocessor chips; Modems; Parallel processing systems; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Shape memory effect; Wind tunnels; High performance computing; Multi-threading; Parallel processing; Public keys; System performance; Multitasking"

First, we assume the route of a mobile agent in the P2P system is fixed. Under this assumption, we propose the usage of an efficient parallel dispatch model where the agent's route is signcrypted at the first step and dispatched to each new peer to collect information. Then, we assume the route is not specified and we propose the usage of a modified multi-signcryption scheme to guarantee protection. Based on this second approach, a mobile agent determines the next peer to communicate with independently and information is collected dynamically in one round of visiting a group of peers.

Information security is becoming increasingly important and more complex as business is conducted electronically. However, state-of-the-art security-related product development has ignored general aspects of HCI. The objective of this paper is to promote and enable security awareness of end-users in their interaction with computer systems. It thus aims to consolidate and integrate the two fields of information security and HCI. HCI as a research discipline is a well developed field of study, and the authors are of the opinion that the use of security technologies can be significantly enhanced by employing proven HCI concepts in the design of these technologies. In order to achieve this, various criteria for a successful HCI in a security-specific environment will be examined.

Pure RBAC seems to be suitable for function-oriented organization structures usually used in relatively stable environments. On the other hand, TBAC and TMAC provide a complementary support in environments that are based on process-oriented organization structures. However, current organizational alternatives lead to the combination of the above approaches, in the form of a matrix organization structure that maximizes the advantages of functional and process-oriented structures and introduces the need for new access control administration paradigms.

In this paper we consider access control to Web-based services that also depends on the strength of identification mechanisms as a context-dependent parameter.

The framework intercepts and analyzes access requests and dynamically adjusts security policies to prevent attackers from exploiting application level vulnerabilities. We present a practical, flexible implementation of the framework based on the Generic Authorization and Access Control API (GAA-API) that provides dynamic authorization and intrusion response capabilities for many applications. To evaluate our approach, we integrated the API with several applications, including the Apache Web server, sshd and FreeS/WAN IPsec for Linux. This paper demonstrates the integration of the GAA-API into ssh daemon. By integrating the GAA-API into the sshd, the ssh server can support fine-grained authorization policies, dynamic policy update, and application level intrusion detection and response. The server can also enforce policies with additional functionality, e.g., time- and location-based controls. Our experiments showed that the required integration effort was moderate, and that the performance impact on the ssh server was reasonable. © 2003 IEEE.","Access control; Authorization; Computer crime; Information security; Intrusion detection; Linux; Permission; Web and internet services; Web server; Wide area networks","Access control; Application programming interfaces (API); Computer crime; Computer operating systems; Gallium alloys; Internet; Internet protocols; Linux; Mercury (metal); Network security; Security of data; Social networking (online); Web services; Wide area networks; World Wide Web; Access control policies; Authorization; Authorization and access control; Authorization frameworks; Internet services; Intrusion detection and response; Permission; Web servers; Intrusion detection"

To protect itself, a host that receives such mobile programs from an untrusted party or via an untrusted network connection will want some kind of guarantee that the mobile code is not about to cause any damage. The traditional solution to this problem has been verification, by which the receiving host examines the mobile program to discover all its actions even before starting execution. Unfortunately, aside from consuming computing resources in itself, verification inhibits traditional compiler optimizations, making such verifiable mobile code much less efficient than native code. We have found an alternative solution by identifying a class of mobile-code representations in which malicious programs can simply not be encoded to begin with. In such an encoding, verification turns into an integral part of the decoding routine. Moreover, support for high-quality just-in-time code generation can be provided. We present two such encodings, one based on highly effective compression of abstract syntax trees, and another based on a reference-safe and type-safe variant of Static Single Assignment form. © 2003, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

Finally, findings from this case study were compared with the results from the statistical analysis. The results from the statistical analysis shows that systems environment security control, codes of ethics, security software control and top management support have a positive significant effect on the level of security effectiveness whereas disincentives certainty and organizational maturity was found to have negative significant effect on the level of security effectiveness. Findings from the case study shows that disincentives certainty, systems environment security control, security software control and organizational maturity are key factors contributing to IS security effectiveness while codes of ethics and top management support are insignificant to IS security effectiveness. © 2003 IEEE.","Computer industry; Computer security; Control systems; Environmental management; Ethics; Information security; Information systems; Information technology; Pervasive computing; Statistical analysis","Computer control systems; Computer supported cooperative work; Control system analysis; Control systems; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Information systems; Information technology; Philosophical aspects; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Statistical methods; Statistics; Ubiquitous computing; Computer industry; Ethics; Information systems security; Organizational maturity; Security controls; Statistical packages; Systems environment; Top management support; Information management"

The sensitivity of the rotation angles is tested with the numerical experiments and the key dimension introduced by this method is roughly estimated. The results presented here show that data encryption with rotated hologram is feasible.","Digital holography; Encryption/decryption; Information security; Virtual optics","Approximation theory; Holograms; Holography; Image reconstruction; Mathematical transformations; Matrix algebra; Optical rotation; Security of data; Digital holography; Encryption/decryption; Virtual optics; Cryptography"

Ideally, information systems security enables management to have confidence that their computational systems will provide the information requested and expected, while denying accessibility to those who have no right to it. Traditional controls are normally inadequate in previous mentioned cases or are focused on the wrong threat, resulting in the exposure of vulnerability. Security is a critical parameter for the expansion and wide usage of agent technology. A threat model is constructed and subsequently the basic techniques to deal effectively with these threats are analyzed. Then this paper presents a dynamic, extensible, configurable and interoperable security architecture for multi-agent systems applied to security assessment services. It is explained how this architecture can be used to tackle a big part of security threats. All the components of the security architecture are analyzed while we also argue for the benefits they offer. Such information security changes often encourage the creation of new security schemas or security improvements. Accommodating frequent systems information changes requires a network security system be more flexible than currently prevalent systems. Consequently, there has recently been an increasing interest in flexible network security and disaster recovery systems. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2003.","","Formal methods; Information management; Information systems; Interoperability; Mobile security; Multi agent systems; Network architecture; Risk assessment; Security of data; Security systems; Architectural approach; Computational system; Disaster recovery; Flexible networks; Information systems security; Security Architecture; Security assessment; Security improvement; Network security"

Applications often need to integrate information from several different information providers. Current approaches for securing this process of integration do not scale well to handle complex trust relationships between consumer applications and providers. Trust mediation is a technique we introduce to address this problem by incorporating a model for representing trust into a framework for retrieving information in a distributed system. Our model for representing trust uses a type system by which data from a source is labeled with a trust type based on qualities of the data itself or the information source(s) providing the data. With this model we develop algorithms to perform static analysis of data queries to infer how the result of the data query can be trusted. We describe an enhanced mediation framework using this inference technique that enables the mediator to govern the flow of information to match intended trust policies in large distributed information systems, even when information may originate from many heterogeneous sources. © 2003 by Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Data integration; Scalable information security; Trust mediation; Trust model","Distributed computer systems; Information systems; Information use; Security of data; Static analysis; Consumer applications; Distributed information systems; Heterogeneous sources; Inference techniques; Information provider; Information sources; Trust mediation; Trust modeling; Data integration"

We contend that the primary impediment to the successful implementation and widespread uptake of the EPR concept is the fact that current healthcare information security (HIS) applications are not sufficiently robust. This paper identifies two main Information Security technologies: 1) Public key infrastructure (PKI) and 2) Biometrics that hold a lot of promise in a healthcare context. The key contribution of this paper is to propose a novel multi-layered HIS framework based on a combination of PKI, Smartcard and Biometrics technologies. We argue that this new HIS framework could assist healthcare institutions to provide a truly secure infrastructure for the electronic transmission of clinical data in the future. This paper also makes a case for the creation of a new nodal HIS body because existing information security bodies like the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams are for general-purpose organizations and not specifically suited for the healthcare sector. © 2003 IEEE.","biometrics; electronic patient records; iris recognition; public key infrastructure; smartcards","Biometrics; Medical computing; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Smart cards; Societies and institutions; Biometrics technology; Electronic patient record; Electronic transmissions; Healthcare institutions; Information security models; Information security technologies; Iris recognition; Public key infrastructure; Health care"

This paper deals with the assessment of the disclosure risk associated to the release of tabular data. So-called sensitivity rules are currently being used to measure the disclosure risk for tables. These rules operate on an a priori basis: the data are examined and the rules are used to decide whether the data can be released as they stand or should rather be protected. In this paper, we propose to complement a priori risk assessment with a posteriori risk assessment in order to achieve a higher level of security, that is, we propose to take the protected information into account when measuring the disclosure risk. The proposed a posteriori disclosure risk measure is compatible with a broad class of disclosure protection methods and can be extended for computing disclosure risk for a set of linked tables. In the case of linked table protection via cell suppression, the proposed measure allows detection of secondary suppression patterns which offer more protection than others.","Security; Statistical databases; Statistical disclosure control; Tabular data",""

As healthcare is an issue that is closely related to the people, it is often organized with regional but at least national peculiarities, especially in Europe. The question to be discussed is how can Healthcare systems be linked together for the benefit of the patients in regard of the limited financial resources for healthcare, and what is the role of information systems in general and PACS in particular, in this context. Particularly in Europe, there are at least three levels to be considered in this context: • a European level• a national level• one or more regional levels (province, county…)The main legislative force is the national level that also plays a key role in standardisation of information security and basic administrative contents. Medical contents, etc. are seldom standardized except for some specialities like cancer statistics and other key epidemiological issues. The European level plays a minor but increasing role. There is a lot of emerging standardisation effort and extensive exchange of research on academic level. The question of a European master patient record is frequently discussed but of minor relevance for the benefit of patient concerning the number of affected patients and potential cost savings. The level where most patients can be affected with probably the highest potential of cost savings in order to provide the best possible level of healthcare to as many people as possible with given financial resources is the regional level. So this paper investigates by example of a regional hospital group in the Austrian province of Styria, how an integrated healthcare system could be established and what role PACS can play in such a setting. Finally, it is of interest to discuss possible general conclusions from these experiences and results. © 2003, Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

The authors note the key partners in Tufts HSDB's success - the close collaboration of the health sciences library, educational affairs, and information technology staff. Tufts HSDB moved quickly from serving the medical curriculum to supporting Tufts' veterinary, dental, biomedical sciences, and nutrition schools, thus leveraging Tufts HSDB research and development with university-wide efforts including Internet2 middleware, wireless access, information security, and digital libraries. The authors identify major effects on teaching and learning, e.g., what is better taught with multimedia, how faculty preparation and student learning time can be more efficient and effective, how content integration for interdisciplinary teaching and learning is promoted, and how continuous improvement methods can be integrated. Also addressed are issues of faculty development, copyright and intellectual property, budgetary concerns, and coordinating IT across schools and hospitals.

One of the best-known anomaly detectors used in intrusion detection is stide. (Rather than STIDE or Stide or s-tide, we have chosen ""stide"" in keeping with the way the detector was referred to in the recent and frequently cited paper by Warrender et al., 1999.) Developed at the University of New Mexico, stide aims to detect attacks that exploit processes that run with root privileges. The original work on stide presented empirical results indicating that data sequences of length six and above were required for effective intrusion detection. This observation has given rise to the long-standing question, ""Why six?"" accompanied by related questions regarding the conditions under which six may (not) be appropriate. This paper addresses the ""Why six"" issue by presenting an evaluation framework for mapping out stide's effective operating space and by identifying conditions that contribute to detection capability, particularly detection blindness. A theoretical justification explains the effectiveness of sequence lengths of six and above, as well as the consequences of using other values. In addition, results of an investigation are presented, comparing stide's anomaly-detection capabilities with those of a competing detector.","Anomaly; Anomaly detection; Evaluation; Intrusion detection; Stide","Algorithms; Computer viruses; Probability; UNIX; Anomaly detection techniques; Data sequences; Intrusion detection; Security of data"

Thus, it can run at a very high cycle rate. The total execution time for an n-bit modular multiplication is 2n + 11 cycles with only (n/2 + 2) PEs. A modular exponentiation based on it takes (3n + 16.5)n cycles in average.

Cognitive INFOSEC (CI) employs the cognition technology to achieve a high level of trust Hardware needs for CI are substantially more demanding than for software radio. CI hardware includes non-RF sensors such as binaural audio, stereo video, biometrics and accelerometers. CR also needs multiband, multimode RF capabilities. This leads to interesting new microwave hardware design tradeoffs. Cognition sensors may share System on Chip (SoC) subsystems with INFOSEC hardware, location-awareness sensors, and RF hardware in wearable formats.

Georgetown also wondered how approaching system planning from the perspective of information assurance would affect the general program planning and development. Implementing the OCTAVEsm process, Georgetown identified the teleradiology program's critical assets, described threats to the assurance of those assets, developed and ran vulnerability scans of a system pilot, evaluated the consequences of security breaches for patients, the teleradiology program and Georgetown and developed a risk management plan to mitigate threats to program assets and implement good information assurance practices in program management.

Traditionally methods of operating disease registers have required that notifications of cases be identified by unique identifiers such as social security number or national identification number, or by ensembles of non-unique identifying data items, such as name, sex and date of birth. However, growing concern over the privacy and confidentiality aspects of disease registers may hinder their future operation. Technical solutions to these legitimate concerns are needed. Discussion: An alternative method of operation is proposed which involves splitting the personal identifiers from the medical details at the source of notification, and separately encrypting each part using asymmetrical (public key) cryptographic methods. The identifying information is sent to a single Population Register, and the medical details to the relevant disease register. The Population Register uses probabilistic record linkage to assign a unique personal identification (UPI) number to each person notified to it, although not necessarily everyone in the entire population. This UPI is shared only with a single trusted third party whose sole function is to translate between this UPI and separate series of personal identification numbers which are specific to each disease register. Summary: The system proposed would significantly improve the protection of privacy and confidentiality, while still allowing the efficient linkage of records between disease registers, under the control and supervision of the trusted third party and independent ethics committees. The proposed architecture could accommodate genetic databases and tissue banks as well as a wide range of other health and social data collections. It is important that proposals such as this are subject to widespread scrutiny by information security experts, researchers and interested members of the general public, alike.","","Computer Security; Confidentiality; Disease Notification; Humans; Medical Record Linkage; Medical Records; Privacy; confidentiality; identity; information processing; medical information system; medical record; privacy; register; review; technique; article; computer security; human; infection control; medical record; methodology"

This need is even more apparent as systems and applications are being distributed and accessed via an insecure network, such as the Internet. The Internet itself has become critical for governments, companies, financial institutions, and millions of everyday users. Networks of computers support a multitude of activities whose loss would all but cripple these organizations. As a consequence, cybersecurity issues have become national security issues. Protecting the Internet is a difficult task. Cybersecurity can be obtained only through systematic development; it can not be achieved through haphazard seat-of-the-pants methods. Applying software engineering techniques to the problem is a step in the right direction. However, software engineers need to be aware of the risks and security issues associated with the design, development, and deployment of network-based software. This paper introduces some known threats to cybersecurity, categorizes the threats, and analyzes protection mechanisms and techniques for countering the threats. Approaches to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber attacks are also discussed.","","Computer crime; Data privacy; Internet; Security of data; Cyber attacks; Cybersecurity; Software engineering"

First, secret speech is coded into binary parameter bits with Mix-Excitation Linear Prediction (MELP) algorithm, and the bits are arranged to form hiding information sequence. Then open speech is divided into several frames for information embedding. On every frame, according to crosscorrelation-based pitch detection method, the instantaneous pitch is utilized to determine the current embedding position in frequency domain of open speech. Finally, information hiding procedure is completed by modifying relevant frequency coefficients, which is controlled with current information bit. At the receiver, based on the same pitch detection method, the embedding position is found and the hiding bit is recovered sequentially. After MELP decoding, the secret speech waveform can be recovered entirely. The experimental results show that the average SNR of middle speech is close to 60 dB, and the watermarking is strongly robust to many attacks such as compression, filter and so on. This algorithm provides a new approach for the research on information security and digital watermarking.","Information hiding; Mix-excitation linear prediction; Pitch period detection; Speech secrecy","Algorithms; Data processing; Decoding; Digital watermarking; Mathematical models; Robustness (control systems); Security of data; Signal filtering and prediction; Signal to noise ratio; Embedding position; Information hiding; Mixed excitation linear prediction; Pitch period detection; Speech hiding; Speech parameter models; Speech secrecy; Speech processing"

Therefore, we extend traditional access control specifications by modeling insecure states and transitions explicitly, to describe possible system behavior after compromise. Next, we observe that it may not always possible to recover from an insecure state, and both compromise and recovery impact the availability of information. Based on these observations, we refine traditional information security properties as liveness assertions and explicitly add recovery actions to our specifications, to guarantee resources are available to legitimate users infinitely often, in spite of malicious attacks or inadvertent compromise.

Using an interdisciplinary and interservice QA approach they compared existing military policies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule to identify gaps and discrepancies. The final report, including a plain English explanation of the individual standards and relevance to the Department of Defense (DoD), a comparative analysis and recommendations, will feed in to the security management process and HIPAA implementation efforts at multiple levels within the DoD. In light of High Reliability Theory, this process models how large enterprises may coordinate policy revision and reform across broad organizational and work domains, building consensus on key policy reforms among military stakeholders across different disciplines, levels of command hierarchy and services.","Health information security; HIPAA; Medical records policy; Policy review","Computer applications; Health care; Information management; Information technology; Reliability theory; Medical records policy; Security of data"

In this paper, we propose a new framework to address this issue. The new approach first perturbs and transforms the original data set based on a set of different belief level without information loss. After that, the transformed data are sent to the data mining consultancy, then rules under different belief levels are generated. After that, the interesting filter is used to eliminate the redundant rules. Rules are useful only in the context of partition performed by the data provider and there is no information disclosure. The proposed technique has been applied to a number of sensitive real life data sets. Experiments results show that our proposed technique is very effective especially when there are many numeric attributes in the data set.","Data mining; Fuzzy systems; Information assurance and security","Algorithms; Data privacy; Fuzzy sets; Information dissemination; Information use; Data sets; Information disclosure; Numeric attributes; Rule mining; Data mining"

The Risk Assessment Methodology was developed by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University as part of the Defense Health Information Assurance Program (DHIAP). The basis for its success is the combination of analysis of organizational practices and technological vulnerabilities. Together, these areas address the core implications behind the HIPAA Security Rule and can be used to develop Organizational Protection Strategies and Technological Mitigation Plans. A key component of OCTAVE is the inter-disciplinary composition of the analysis team (Patient Administration, IT staff and Clinician). It is this unique composition of analysis team members, along with organizational and technical analysis of business practices, assets and threats, which enables facilities to create sound and effective security policies. The Risk Assessment is conducted in-house, and therefore the process, results and knowledge remain within the organization, helping to build consensus in an environment of differing organizational and disciplinary perspectives on Health Information Assurance.","DOD; HIPAA; Information Assurance; OCTAVE; Privacy; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Security","Health care; Information technology; Risk assessment; Risk management; Health information assurance; Security of data"

The people aspect enables remote collaboration, support communities of practice, reward and recognize knowledge sharing while encouraging storytelling. The process aspect enhances knowledge capture and manages information. While the technology aspect enhance system integration and data mining, it also utilizes intelligent agents and exploits expert systems.

One such requirement is to achieve high-rate communications between clients, e.g., terminals or sensors, in the network while hiding information about the transmitted symbols, signal activity, or other sensitive data from an unintended receiver, e.g., an eavesdropper. For wireless links, the single-user capacity advantages of deployment of multiple antennas at the transmitter is well known. One of the principal conclusions of this paper is that proper exploitation of space-time diversity at the transmitter can also enhance information security and information-hiding capabilities. In particular, we show that significant gains are achievable when the transmitter and the client receiver are both informed about their channel while the transmitter and eavesdropper receiver are uniformed about their channel. More generally, we compare capacity limits for both informed and uninformed transmitter and informed receiver scenarios subject to low probability of intercept (LPI) and low probability of detection (LPD) constraints. For several general cases, we can characterize the LPI- and LPD-optimal transmitted source distributions and compare them to the standard optimal source distribution satisfying a power constraint. We assume the standard quasi-static flat Rayleigh-fading channel model for the transmitter-receiver pairs. This paper is a step toward answering the fundamental question: what are the qualitative and quantitative differences between the information-carrying capabilities of open space-time channels versus secure space-time channels?","Chernoff exponents; Covert channels; Flat Rayleigh-fading models; Information hiding; Perfect secrecy; Space-time channel capacity; Space-time coding; Wireless eaves-droppers","Antennas; Channel capacity; Decoding; Demodulation; Gaussian noise (electronic); Matrix algebra; Rayleigh fading; Sensors; Signal detection; Signal interference; Signal to noise ratio; Transmitters; Watermarking; Chernoff exponents; Covert channels; Information hiding; Space-time channel capacity; Space-time coding; Wireless eavesdroppers; Information theory"

A layered defense is based on the assumption that a breech in one layer does not compromise the entire system. Most of today's networks are secured by a perimeter defense only. Alcatel's Authenticated VLAN technology gives organizations the ability to implement security-in-depth by starting at the network ingress point - the switch port. The Alcatel OmniSwitch family secures access to the switch port and layer two VLAN and controls communications between layer three subnets and layer four services. Alcatel's A-VLAN feature allows an organization to implement a user-based login at the port and VLAN prior to granting the user general network access. A-VLANs increase network security without compromising performance, streamline network administration, provide a network usage record, segment the network in to more manageable entities, supply a level of single sign-on, introduce redundancy into the authentication process, and can provision management between multiple controlling entities.

IT is not, however, a monolithic field, rather it is a discipline made up of several fairly well defined interest areas each of which have their own pedagogical concerns and issues, only some of which are in the area of security. This study is designed to gain a better understanding of the extent to which IT programs and the interest areas within them have changed to include a greater security component, and the means by which this has been accomplished (e.g. through the addition of new courses or the modification of existing courses). Data to support this area of inquiry has been drawn from several sources. Surveys were sent to attendees of CITC3 that directed them to a web form that gathered information about their perceptions of the need to change their programs and the means by which they had carried out the changes. Interviews were conducted with RIT teaching faculty during bi-monthly interest area meetings and a sample of survey respondents to gain a more in-depth understanding of the issues surrounding both the means and the extent of the changes they had accomplished. All of the respondents to this study felt that they needed to increase the amount of security content in their IT programs. While all of the respondents described their efforts as works in progress, only two had added new courses. Respondents were equally unanimous in feeling that security content needed to be spread across many courses rather than isolated in one course. Results from interviews conducted during interest area meetings with RIT faculty indicate the following: • While all of the interest areas indicated the need to modify their curriculum to enhance the security content in it, each of the interest areas had a very different conception of how this should be accomplished. • Only the networking group saw the need to add additional courses to the existing curriculum. • The database group felt that adding new security modules to existing courses was the best way to enhance the security content in their interest area. • The programming group interpreted the need to enhance students' awareness of security as a need to enhance students' awareness of good programming techniques and structures.

In the U.S., approximately one-third retail sales are from franchising companies. Many businesses use franchising as means of market expansion. In addition to less capital requirements, franchising is capable of expanding market share geographically in a short period of time. One of the important factors that determine the success of a franchising business is information efficiency. To keep up with the quick expansion of a franchising business, a company has to have a quick solution for a scalable information network. Traditional technology builds such network through heavy investment in network infrastructure. The requirements in initial capital investment in many cases put a brake on the adoption of the technology by franchising companies. Most off them are short on capital. As the development of Internet, browser/server technology has become an ideal choice for franchising business. Using Internet as its network help franchising companies to avoid the heavy initial network infrastructure investment. While Internet technology is still popular and is becoming a mainstream technology for business applications, we want to present an alternative wireless technology Short Message System (SMS). Comparing to Internet technology, SMS has pros and cons. The pros of SMS are its less requirement in initial capital investment, lower operating costs and easier implementation; the cons of SMS are its limitation on information volume and its weakness in information security. In the paper, we make a comparison among three different technologies to show the advantages of an SMS-based information system. We also use a real life example to show how to avoid the limitation of SMS by designing a communication scheme.","Franchising; GSM; Information System; SMS; Wireless","Electronic commerce; Global system for mobile communications; Information science; Internet; Investments; Personal digital assistants; Professional aspects; Sales; Security of data; Voice/data communication systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cats (CO); China; China Mobile (CO); China Telecom (CO); Franchising; Information system; Short message system (SMS); SMS; USA; Management information systems"

A built-in TSRG RNG is a distinguishable primitive in the proposed cryptosystem design where instantaneous real time One Time Pad (OTP)_like data is generated. Most cryptography relies on unproven complexity assumptions like integer factorization being computationally hard, with the adversary limited by computing power. However, advances in cryptanalysis, computing technology and unpublished researches may make current cryptosystems insecure. Shannon's pessimistic result essentially denotes that if the adversary is all-powerful, then efficient practical solutions for information-theoretic security do not exist. However, the TSRG RNG implements a simple idea of reseeding the RNG at unpredictable instants to an unpredictable state creating a new RNG model before the attackers can acquire enough information to identify the current model. In TSRG design, security is based on a proven insoluble problem. The previous published work proves that TSRG RNG produced output is random and cannot be predicated using available technologies and mathematical theories if the state of the generator is not compromised. This requires a secure way of exchanging of the OTP_like digest to be expanded at the receiver side as well as preventing the attackers from mounting state compromise attacks. The paper discuses how randomized encryption techniques can aid in designing the TSRG cryptosystem to defend possible cracking trials. Suitable usage of two randomized encryption techniques eliminates the threat of message related attacks and smoothes out the statistical distribution of inputs to the algorithm.","Cryptography; Cryptosystem; Encryption; Hybrid Cryptosystems; Information Security; Internet Security; OTP; Security; TSRG","Algorithms; Compact disks; Data reduction; Mathematical models; Problem solving; Security of data; Strategic planning; Cryptosystem; Hybrid cryptosystems; OTP; TSRG; Cryptography"

We investigate and compare the performance of IDSs based on the mentioned techniques, with respect to a well-known set of intrusion evaluation data gathered by Lincoln Labs. Through a variety of experiments and analysis, it is found that, with appropriately chosen population size, program size, crossover rate and mutation rate, LGPs outperform other techniques in terms of detection accuracy at the expense of time.

We propose an S-DoS prevention approach by extending the well-known mirror sites idea by redirecting different access requests from the same user to different mirror sites. We develop an HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) parser that fragments the HTTP requests for communication between the client and server. Random assignment of the requests to different mirror sites ensures that the attacker cannot succeed by capturing requests for a single Web server and the high degree of unpredictability in mirror selection makes it computationally and resource intensive for an attacker to predict the next chosen mirror site. A suite of analysis of the proposed scheme is presented as a merit of this approach. © 2003 IEEE.","","Internet; Security of data; Transmission control protocol; Denial of Service; Denial of service attacks; Random assignment; Web servers; HTTP"

Cambridge has four independent manufacturing units, each of which currently bases all operational decisions on internally generated cost and profitability information. In 2000, Cambridge established a special enterprise level division to consider best practices for collecting qualitative product and service feedback from customers and to subsequently consider how to best integrate such nontraditional, nonfinancial information into their own operational. This realistic scenario gives students an opportunity to consider the financial and managerial implications of moving to customer-centric operational decision-making. Business articles on the advantages of customer centricity abound, but few sources consider the financial and managerial consequences beyond increased customer loyalty and satisfaction. In actuality, this current business trend requires significant reengineering of information systems and management practices. Consequently, accounting methods must be re-evaluated for accuracy and fit with new systems and management practices. At the heart of this case is an opportunity for students to consider the appropriate balance of traditional financial and customer-driven nonfinancial information in management decision models for optimal profitability of the company and its individual units. In addition, the instructor can delve into a number of internal control and political issues related to information sharing. There is also opportunity for students to consider at a high level the complexities of balancing open information sharing and information security. Several alternative questions and suggested solutions are provided for the instructor at the end of the case. We suggest that instructors select only three or four of the questions so students can spend more time on each selected issue.

Issues arise however when atomic multicast is employed in Information Assurance (IA) settings where extreme failure behaviors such as send-omission of processes and message timeliness violations are likely. The issues are compounded by security weaknesses in the communication software that make it easier for intruders to stage attacks. These issues impact the design of atomic multicast protocols which have hitherto assumed on only benign failures such as process crash and network message loss/delay. In this paper, we revisit atomic multicast protocols, which have hitherto assumed only benign failures such as process crash and network message loss/delay. In this paper, we revisit atomic multicast protocols, taking into account the IA dimension as well. Our study reveals the need for a secure centralized entity to realize the multicast message delivery functions.

By adopting this approach to project planning, we intended to provide evidence that including information security as an intrinsic component of project planning improves information assurance and that using information assurance as a planning tool produces and improves the general system management plan. Several considerations justify this approach to planning a safe teleradiology system. First, because OCTAVEsm was designed as a method for retrospectively assessing and proposing enhancements for the security of existing information management systems, it should function well as a guide to prospectively designing and deploying a secure information system such as teleradiology. Second, because OCTAVEsm provides assessment and planning tools for use primarily by interdisciplinary teams from user organizations, not consultants, it should enhance the ability of such teams at the local level to plan safe information systems. Third, from the perspective of sociological theory, OCTAVEsm explicitly attempts to enhance organizational conditions identified as necessary to safely manage complex technologies. Approaching information system design from the perspective of information security risk management proactively integrates health information assurance into a project's core. This contrasts with typical approaches that perceive ""security"" as a secondary attribute to be ""added"" after designing the system and with approaches that identify information assurance only with security devices and user training. The perspective of health information assurance embraces so many dimensions of a computerized health information system's design that one may successfully deploy a method for retrospectively assessing information security risk as a prospective planning tool. From a sociological perspective, this approach enhances the general conditions as well as establishes specific policies and procedures for reliable performance of health information assurance.","Accident; Data security; Data security breach; Health information assurance; HIPAA; Information system protection; Organizational theory; Reliability; Teleradiology","Health care; Radiology; Risk assessment; Security of data; Social aspects; Teleradiology; Information management"

RFC3041 provides for anonymity by applying MD5 to the interface-identifier portion of the IPv6 address generated by the stateless automatic setup process. RFC3041 specifies a way to set up anonymous IP addresses for network interfaces. Like an IP-unicasting address, these addresses have fixed periods of validity. However, a possibility of somebody tapping the network prefix and thus discovering the linkage between the anonymous IP address and the MAC address assigned to the corresponding network interface remains. Thus, in this research, we set anonymous source IP addresses in the interface-address portion of the IP header for IPv6 as specified by RFC3041, and use the 64 lower-order bits of the anonymous address as an identifier that specifies the host and type of communication. This identifier is adjusted by all nodes on the route to a server from a client. When the server replies, each node relays the packet by link-local multicasting, and the identifier is checked at each node to determine whether it is a reply to a transmission sent by the given local host. Furthermore, in transmission in the same direction, pinpointing of source networks is prevented by exchanging the current prefix for that of the next network.","Anonymous communication; Information security; IPv6","Bulletin boards; Computer networks; Electronic commerce; Human computer interaction; Interfaces (computer); Multicasting; Telecommunication; Anonymous communication; Electronic voting; IPv6; Security of data"

NAT argues that complex systems such as enterprise health information systems display multiple, interdependent interactions among diverse parts that potentially manifest unfamiliar, unplanned, or unexpected sequences that operators may not perceive or immediately understand, particularly during emergencies. If the system functions rapidly with few breaks in time, space or process development, the effects of single failures ramify before operators understand or gain control of the incident thus producing catastrophic accidents. HRT counters that organizations with strong leadership support, continuous training, redundant safety features and ""cultures of high reliability"" contain the effects of component failures even in complex, tightly coupled systems. Building highly integrated, enterprise-wide computerized health information management systems risks creating the conditions for catastrophic breaches of data security as argued by NAT. The data security regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) implicitly depend on the premises of High Reliability Theorists. Limitations in HRT thus have implications for both safe program design and compliance efforts. MHS and other health care organizations should consider both NAT and HRT when designing and deploying enterprise-wide computerized health information systems.","Accident; Data security; Data security breach; Health information assurance; HIPAA; Information system protection; Organizational theory; Reliability","Health care; Large scale systems; Management information systems; Reliability; Security of data; Social aspects; Military health systems (MHS); Medical imaging"

This PKI-based VOIM security approach has additional features like confidentiality, authentication, and integrity for the purpose of data encryption under the environment of network.","Asymmetric algorithm; Certification authority; Information optics; Information security; Public-key- infrastructure; Virtual-optics","Algorithms; Cryptography; Electronic commerce; Electronic document identification systems; Hybrid computers; Management information systems; Optical data storage; Information security systems; Optical encryption; Public key infrastructures (PKI); Virtual-optics imaging; Security of data"

As information security is paramount to accurate financial reporting and the provision of timely and relevant managerial accounting reports for decision-making, the issue of sharing information on computer systems security has direct relevance to accounting, as well as to public policy. This paper presents a model to examine the welfare economic implications of this movement. In the absence of information sharing, each firm independently sets its information security expenditures at a level where the marginal benefits equal the marginal costs. It is shown that when information is shared, each firm reduces the amount spent on information security activities. Nevertheless, information sharing can lead to an increased level of information security. The paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for information sharing to lead to an increased (decreased) level of information security. The level of information security that would be optimal for a firm in the absence of information sharing can be attained by the firm at a lesser cost when computer security information is shared. Hence, sharing provides benefits to each firm and total welfare also increases. However, in the absence of appropriate incentive mechanisms, each firm will attempt to free ride on the security expenditures of other firms (i.e., renege from the sharing agreement and refuse to share information). This latter situation results in the underinvestment of information security. Thus, appropriate incentive mechanisms are necessary for increases in both firm-level profits and social welfare to be realized from information sharing arrangements. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The stable model semantics is used to decide the users' access rights on data items. Under the proposed framework, conflicting problem is addressed and a promising resolution method is presented based on the underlying delegation relations and hierarchical structures of subjects, objects and access rights. The authorization inheritance are also supported in our model.

This insatiable demand for realism in CGAs for synthetic environments arises from the growing understanding of the significant role that modeling and simulation can play in a variety of uses, These uses include training, analysis, procurement decisions, mission rehearsal, doctrine development, force-level and task-level training, information assurance, cyberwarfare, force structure analysis, sustainability analysis, life cycle costs analysis, material management, infrastructure analysis, and many other uses, in these and other uses of military synthetic environments, CGAs play a central role because they have the potential to increase the realism of the environment while also reducing the cost of operating the environment.

Because security has become a key element in most network designs, it is essential that the products Alcatel builds are conceived with strong security in mind. Good security is security in depth, that is, a breech in one area will not compromise the entire network. Security in depth is implemented by creating multiple layers of defense around important assets. This is achieved by ensuring that products are hardened against attack, implement a security by default configuration profile, regulate and provision administrative controls, offer value-added security services to end users, and leverage partner security technologies to protect against predefined threats. The Alcatel information security framework is a design philosophy. Products that are certified according to this framework help to reassure Alcatel's established and prospective customers that security is a fundamental design element of all enterprise products, not merely an afterthought.","","Computer software; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Network protocols; Public policy; Security of data; Anti-virus software; Diligent monitoring; Network design; System availability; Telecommunication networks"

There is increasing number of threats to information security, which originates from the internal users of the system. Insider is defined as a trusted person and has access to classified documents. Our focus here is on understanding mechanisms for monitoring insiders working with the intelligence community. The analyst working with the intelligence community usually works on a TOI (Topic of Interest) and AOI (Area of Interest) so that they can develop a report about a very specific question. How do we ensure that these analysts do not perform malicious act during their course of collection, analysis and report generation for a given task? We suggest the need for social network monitoring of these analysts, which would help decreasing the threats of malicious intent of the insider. In this paper, we first provide a logical representation of analyst workflow model. Secondly, we describe the use of social network approach in general and suggest its application to monitoring insider threats.

This economic system requires a flexible approach to data protection because subjects are compensated based on the amount of disclosure of personal information. Compensation is linked through a data protection model based on Confidentiality via Camouflage (CVC) presented in Gopal et al. (2002).

Some of these super trees are quantized to embed the watermark signal in the image. In the process of cryptanalysis we can identify the groups which are quantized during watermark insertion process.

The aim of this paper is to present an infrastructure of trusted user authentication for heightened information security. Following techniques are developed to achieve the goal. Unlike the common post-boot authentication method, an approach of pre-boot biometric authentication is presented with different solutions to enhance network security. In real applications, privacy is a major concern in using biometric authentication systems. A two-way authentication method is therefore proposed, which will not only let the system authenticate the users, but also allow the users to verify the system before submitting their biometrics information. Based on these authentication strategies, a user authentication scheme for protecting high security resources is presented, which differentiates itself from most existing solutions by stressing security more than cost and ease-of-use. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.","","Authentication; Biometrics; Security of data; Authentication methods; Biometric authentication; Biometric authentication system; Biometrics informations; High securities; Real applications; User authentication; User authentication scheme; Network security"

Currently, security analysts face an increasing workload as their environments expand and attacks become more frequent. We conducted contextual interviews with security analysts to gain an understanding of the people and work of ID. Our findings reveal that organizational changes must be combined with improved technical tools for effective, long-term solutions to the difficulties of scaling ID work. We propose a three-phase task model in which tasks could be decoupled according to requisite expertise. In particular, monitoring tasks can be separated and staffed by less experienced ID analysts with corresponding tool support. Thus, security analysts will be better able to cope with increasing security threats in their expanding networks. Additionally, organizations will be afforded more flexibility in hiring and training new analysts. © 2004, Association for Information Systems.

Though very small, this memory often contains highly valuable information (identification data, cryptographic key, etc). This is why it is subject to many attacks, as the other parts of the smart card, and thus requires appropriately chosen protections. The use of memories in smart cards induces security problems, but also other more particular ones. The main constraint is naturally the limited physical expansion and integration, but fault level, aging and power consumption are not to be discarded. Indeed, deducing the context of a ROM using a microscope has been proven to work. Interactions with light or eddy current on silicon can produce faults that might reveal important information, as well. This article details the role of memory in smart card industries, in current context and future perspectives of smart cards and their applications. It then gives a survey of published physical attacks targeting memory and all the existing techniques to counter them. Great efforts are undertaken by industries and academics to tackle specific memory problems introducing hardware and software countermeasures in the designs. This struggle between security and hackers permits in the one hand tremendous breakthroughs in research but in the other hand makes rather difficult for manufacturers to maintain cost effectiveness, that is one important factor for smart card. © 2003 IEEE.","Aging; Cryptography; Data security; Eddy currents; Energy consumption; Information security; Microscopy; Protection; Read only memory; Smart cards","Aging of materials; Cost effectiveness; Cryptography; Digital storage; Eddy current testing; Eddy currents; Energy utilization; Hardware security; Microscopic examination; Personal computing; ROM; Security of data; Surveys; Transportation; Cryptographic key; Future perspectives; Hardware and software; Identification data; Protection; Security problems; Smart card industry; Tamper resistance; Smart cards"

Today's portal platforms provide some security functionality, mainly targeting at supporting a single-sign-on for the underlying applications. We argue that single-sign-on is not sufficient, but rather a mature security service is needed as a central authorization instance. As access control is needed on different levels of a portal architecture, only this allows an integrated approach to security management. We present CSAP (Communication Security, Authentication, and Privacy), a flexible security system for enterprise and e-government portals. CSAP was originally developed within the EU-funded research project ""Webocracy"". Meanwhile, various enhancements to CSAP have been made, which are being discussed in this paper. The major enhancement is a Metadata-based Access Control facility (MBAC) which allows more flexibility in highly open and heterogeneous systems.

System call monitoring has been touted as an effective defense against control hijacking attacks because it could prevent remote attackers from inflicting damage upon a victim system even if they can successfully compromise certain applications running on the system. However, the Achilles' heel of the system call monitoring approach is the construction of accurate system call behavior model that minimizes false positives and negatives. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Program semantics-Aware Intrusion Detection system called Paid, which automatically derives an application-specific system call behavior model from the application's source code, and checks the application's run-time system call pattern against this model to thwart any control hijacking attacks. The per-application behavior model is in the form of the sites and ordering of system calls made in the application, as well as its partial control flow. Experiments on a fully working Paid prototype show that Paid can indeed stop attacks that exploit non-standard security holes, such as format string attacks that modify function pointers, and that the run-time latency and throughput penalty of Paid are under 11.66% and 10.44%, respectively, for a set of production-mode network server applications including Apache, Sendmail, Ftp daemon, etc. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Intrusion detection; Mimicry attack; Non-deterministic finite state automaton; Sandboxing; System call graph","Application programs; Mercury (metal); Monitoring; Semantics; Servers; Throughput; Application behavior models; Application-specific systems; Deterministic finite state automata; Intrusion Detection Systems; Mimicry attack; Sandboxing; System call monitoring; System calls; Intrusion detection"

Both are concerned with protecting something of value, and both have many aspects that need to be considered to ensure the development of cost effective security practices. Repositories for items of value become targets for theft, and the transport of items of value increases the risk for theft. Some major differences between physical security and information security are the higher risk of malicious attacks with information networks, the exposure of wireless information during transmission, and that information can be stolen without being physically removed. This paper highlights the many faces of security and provides concrete examples from the literature of common security breaches, security problems and security solutions that are relevant to vehicle information systems, and tradeoffs.

However, if research into security is to be successful, then researchers' mindsets have to match and exceed those who engage in intrusive, unlawful and unethical activities in the field of Information Systems and Technology. Security Professionals and for that matter those engaged in research and security product/service development need to be able to 'think like the criminals but not act like them'. Such a task is extremely difficult because unlike criminals/terrorists, Security Professionals thinking is highly conditioned by regulations, law, rules, procedures, documentation, policies, values ethics, and concern for the consequences of undesirable action on those affected. There is of course the danger that if you follow the criminal ways of thinking then you may become tempted to follow their behavior eventually. So, how can the mindsets be trained to enable Security Professionals to think freely without necessarily having to go through experience based learning! How can we develop doctoral programs that specifically target the development of the conceptual mindsets of the researchers! What specific sets of concepts will be useful for addressing these issues!

Information integrity is critically and strategically important to healthcare organisations today. Considering information integrity implications of HIPAA requirements can help healthcare administrators identify strengths and weaknesses in their stored information and in the ways in which it is shared with business partners and other healthcare providers. In this article, we describe the impact of HIPAA on information integrity as well as the information integrity challenges that still lie ahead for healthcare organisations. After a brief overview of general information integrity issues related to information sharing across multiple healthcare organisations, we discuss integrity concerns specific to the primary components of the administrative simplification provision of HIPAA, including transaction codes and standards, unique identifier codes, information privacy and information security. The articles closes with a call for additional research to document the true impacts and costs of the legislation, to produce a framework with which practitioners can make informed choices about information integrity issues.

Combine this with a slowdown in IT spending resulting in justifications of every purchase, and security professionals are forced to scramble to find comprehensive and effective ways to assess their environment in order to discover and prioritize vulnerabilities, and to develop cost-effective solutions that show benefit to the business. A Practical Guide to Security Assessments is a process-focused approach that presents a structured methodology for conducting assessments. The key element of the methodology is an understanding of business goals and processes, and how security measures are aligned with business risks. The guide also emphasizes that resulting security recommendations should be cost-effective and commensurate with the security risk. The methodology described serves as a foundation for building and maintaining an information security program. In addition to the methodology, the book includes an Appendix that contains questionnaires that can be modified and used to conduct security assessments. This guide is for security professionals who can immediately apply the methodology on the job, and also benefits management who can use the methodology to better understand information security and identify areas for improvement. © 2004 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Security breaches are typically categorized into unauthorized data observation, incorrect data modification, and data unavailability. Unauthorized data observation results in disclosure of information to users not entitled to gain access to such information. All organizations we may think of, ranging from commercial organizations to social organizations such as healthcare organizations, may suffer heavy losses from both financial and human points of view upon unauthorized data observation.

Usually, organizations perform risk analysis in order to adjust their security practices and controls to an acceptable level of risk. One of the various outputs of a risk analysis is a set of recommended practices expressed in high-level statements of a natural language. In order to be applied to the real world, it is necessary to technically implement those requirements tailored to the specific organizational context. This is usually performed by experienced individuals. For this technical implementation and the configuration of the information technology facilities, several formal policy languages exist, which define access control policies, roles and responsibilities. This paper describes requirements for a software tool that could assist in the transition from high-level security requirements to a formal, well-defined policy language. Such a tool would provide valuable assistance and support in both policy implementation and overall security management.","Automation; Data security; Language; Risk analysis","Automation; Computer aided software engineering; Natural language processing systems; Risk assessment; Security of data; Effective security management; Formal security policy; Risk analysis; Security policy languages; Information management"

Laboratories for training Network Engineers have previously been deployed in IT education, frequently using a standard operating system base configuration in order to facilitate re-imaging for new classes. We have elected to employ a mujlti-platform environment that utilizes bothWindows and Linux operating systems. The Sandbox is called such because it is a creative experimental area physically isolated from all other networks including the Internet. Experimentation with every class of vulnerability such as viruses, worms, parasites, malware, and Denial of Service attacks is evaluated, mitigated and controlled. Having a strictly Linux-based environment as others frequently have done avoids the escalating problems introduced by Windows platforms. We have elected to study and experiment with multiple OS environments and confront the challenges that Windows presents. The Sandbox security laboratory has served as a test-bed for executing security labs created by students concurrent with the running of two different upper-class and graduate university-level IT security courses. Students created both the lectures and the labs used in these security courses. The first course was a very comprehensive course in all topics of network, internet and web security. The sescond course dealt with identity management, data privacy and identity theft. Students architected the network topology and built the Sandbox. The Sandbox is designed in a modular fashion to facilitate the creation of multiple network nodes with firewalls, IDSs, and associated servers, routers and switches. A student Security Team was organized to administer the Sandbox. Security Best Practices were developed to ensure consistent management of the Sandbox and its security policies. IT undergraduate and graduate students have learned that the role of a Security Systems Engineer involves not only technology, but also responsible management of policy and Best Practices concepts Copyright 2004 ACM.","Collaborative student teaching; Curricula; Data privacy; Information assurance; Information technology; Security best practices; Security laboratory; Security system engineer","Computer science; Curricula; Data privacy; Information management; Internet; Laboratories; Security systems; Software engineering; Students; Teaching; Collaborative student teaching; Information assurance; Security best practises; Security laboratory; Security system engineers; Information technology"

The potential of cyber terrorism has posed a threat to national security; meanwhile the increasing prevalence of malware and incidents of cyber attacks hinder the utilization of the Internet to its greatest benefit and incur significant economic losses to individuals, enterprises, and public organizations. This paper presents some recent advances in intrusion detection, feature selection, and malware detection. In intrusion detection, stealthy and low profile attacks that include only few carefully crafted packets over an extended period of time to delude firewalls and the intrusion detection system (IDS) have been difficult to detect. In protection against malware (trojans, worms, viruses, etc.), how to detect polymorphic and metamorphic versions of recognized malware using static scanners is a great challenge. We present in this paper an agent based IDS architecture that is capable of detecting probe attacks at the originating host and denial of service (DoS) attacks at the boundary controllers. We investigate and compare the performance of different classifiers implemented for intrusion detection purposes. Further, we study the performance of the classifiers in real-time detection of probes and DoS attacks, with respect to intrusion data collected on a real operating network that includes a variety of simulated attacks. Feature selection is as important for IDS azs it is for many other modeling problems. We present several techniques for feature selection and compare their performance in the IDS application. It is demonstrated that, with appropriately chosen features, both probes and DoS attacks can be detected in real time or near real time at the originating host or at the boundary controllers. We also briefly present some encouraging recent results in detecting polymorphic and metamorphic malware with advanced static, signature-based scanning techniques. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.","","Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Cybersecurity; Denial-of-service attack; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Losses; National security; Network security; Terrorism; Viruses; Computer crime; Computer worms; Decision making; Malware; Mercury (metal); Probes; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-terrorism; Denialof- service attacks; Detection problems; Features selection; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Malwares; Performance; Denial of Service; Malware detection; Metamorphic malware; Metamorphic versions; Public organizations; Real-time detection; Scanning techniques; Probes; Intrusion detection"

Wireless local area networks provide a luxury of mobility to clients so that they may roam about without the restriction of wires, room, and/or buildings. At the same time, wireless local area networks have given birth to a new breed of network weaknesses that are compounding and exploiting current local area network vulnerabilities. Today's college campuses present students and professors with a unique environment of network connectivity. Workstations and laptops have the ability to connect to the campus network either through wired or wireless access points. The popularity of wireless mobility has generated an influx of wireless clients on college campuses throughout the United States. However, the popularity has not been as eagerly received by network administrators. Because a great majority of these users lack the knowledge and/or experience to implement best practices such as installing the latest security patches and antivirus software protection or properly configuring firewalls, college campus networks are experiencing high levels of unwanted malicious activity. Network engineers have implemented quick fixes such as ""Blacklists"" that keep track of infected computers, denying access until properly patched and cleaned. However, this is a labor-intensive temporary solution that requires user involvement, not a fully functional system that automates all the necessary security updates and antivirus software installations as well as assuring proper firewall configuration. An enormous challenge is being faced to keep wireless clients updated with security patches, antivirus protection, and firewall configurations. Viruses and worms are released daily, escalating the problem of keeping wireless clients updated. In response, an automated wireless security patch management system can alleviate the aggravation and overhead associated with the wireless clients. In addition, a wireless security patch management system will also increase the networks information security structure. This paper focuses on a wireless security patch management/antivirus update system that seeks to remedy the problem presented by wireless clients that are not updated with current security patches, antivirus software, and weak or no firewall settings.

We propose a security-based agent for building a safeguard for a virtual enterprise to protect its information, and to reasonably distribute tasks to cooperative objects to solve the issue of concurrent events. The security-policy management and task-scheduling modules are cores of the agent.

The former OPE protocols are based on an intractability assumption except for OT protocols. In fact, evaluating P(x) is equivalent to computing the product of the coefficient vectors (a 0,..., an) and (1,..., xn). Using this idea, an efficient scale product protocol of two vectors is proposed first and then two OPE protocols are presented which do not need any other cryptographic assumption except for OT protocol. Compared with the existing OPE protocol, another characteristic of the proposed protocols is the. degree of the polynomial is private. Another OPE protocol works in case of existence of untrusted third party.","Information security; Oblivious polynomial evaluation; Oblivious transfer; Secure multi-party computation","Boolean algebra; Computational complexity; Computational methods; Cryptography; Logic circuits; Probability; Security of data; Vectors; Oblivious polynomial evaluation; Oblivious transfer; Secure multi-party computation; Polynomials"

Note, however, that we are not recommending that the entrepreneur simply turn over the running of the e-commerce aspect of the business to the ASP. Instead, we advocate that the entrepreneur be a proactive participant in the design of the system. Consequently, attention must be directed to the specifics of the service level agreement. The entrepreneur should view this document as the basic contract governing the relationship between the firm and the ASP. Thus, it should spell out the details concerning the level of service to be provided across a wide range of issues.

In this article we propose a conceptual model of this behavior as the outcome of a boundedly-rational choice process. We explore this model in a survey of undergraduate students (N = 167) at two large public universities. We asked about the frequency with which they engaged in five commonplace but unsafe computing practices, and probed their decision processes with regard to these practices. Although our respondents saw themselves as knowledgeable, competent users, and were broadly aware that serious consequences were quite likely to result, they reported frequent unsafe computing behaviors.

VISUAL is part of our Network Eye security visualization architecture, also described in this paper. We have designed and tested a new computer security visualization that gives a quick overview of current and recent communication patterns in the monitored network to the users. Many tools can detect and show fan-out and fan-in, but VISUAL shows network events graphically, in context. Visualization helps users comprehend the intensity of network events more intuitively than text-based tools can. VISUAL provides insight for networks with up to 2,500 home hosts and 10,000 external hosts, shows the relative activity of hosts, displays them in a constant relative position, and reveals the ports and protocols used.

The same can be said for questions of privacy. This article starts by showing how and why information assurance and privacy can become problems worthy of ethical consideration. It demonstrates that there is no simple and linear relationship between ethics and information assurance, nor between ethics and privacy. Many decisions in the area of IT, however, affect not only one but both of these subjects. The ethical evaluation of decisions and actions in the area of privacy and security is therefore highly complex. The article explores the question of whether individual responsibility is a useful construct to address ethical issues of this complexity. After introducing a theory of responsibility, the article discusses the conditions that a subject of responsibility is typically assumed to fulfil. The article will argue that individual human beings lack some of the essential preconditions necessary to be ascribed responsibility. Individuals have neither the power, nor the knowledge, nor the intellectual capacities to successfully deal with the ethical challenges in the tension of privacy and information assurance. The article ends by suggesting that the concept of responsibility may nevertheless be useful in this setting, but it would have to be expanded to allow collective entities as subjects.","Ethics; Information assurance; Privacy; Responsibility; Security",""

Preliminary results are encouraging and there appears to be no reason why the TBSE techniques could not be applied to a wide range of threats and countermeasures.

Learning to design and implement security best practices is a teaching opportunity for students preparing to be Network Engineers, Security System Engineers or Security Architects. The best practices of the security lab were patterned after IT industry policy concepts that effectively handled change while maintaining a secure and stable infrastructure. The security best practices were developed under the supervision of a student security team and faculty advisor. The use of the IT security lab by undergraduate and graduate students for security projects provided a test of the viability of the security best practices. With the security team and the security policies in place, a working security lab is a realistic learning model in training and educating IT undergraduates and graduates in proper security practices.

With the introduction of information technology and the resulting security challenges that organizations face daily, it has become essential to ensure the security of the organization's information and other valuable assets. However, one aspect that auditing does not cover effectively is that of the behaviour of the employee, which is so crucial to any organization's security. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential problems concerning the attempt to audit the behaviour of the employee. It will be demonstrated that it is extremely difficult to audit human behaviour and so an alternative method to behavioural auditing needs to be found, where policing the employee is not necessary, but instead a softer, more informal approach is used to change the culture to a more information security conscious one. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In real-time teleradiology services, the system is expected to respond very quickly however to verify the signature a considerable amount of time is spent to compute the hash value of the image since the image size might be huge (tens of megabytes). Motivating by this fact, in this paper we propose EVEREST, an efficient methodology for verification. The key observation we have made is that in the traditional verification the processor of the verifying machine is idle (I/O blocked) while the image is downloaded. In EVEREST, to improve the real-time efficiency the receiver can perform most of the hash computation while he is receiving the image itself One other important advantage of our scheme is the communication efficiency since getting the entire image file is no longer necessary to detect the tampering. © 2004 IMIA.

User authentication is a foundation procedure in the overall pursuit of these objectives, and password procedures have historically been the primary method of user authentication. There is an inverse relationship between the level of security provided by a password procedure and ease of recall for users. The longer the password and the more variability in its characters, the higher the level of security provided by such a password (because they are more difficult to violate or ""crack""). However, such passwords tend to be more difficult for end users to remember, particularly when the password does not spell a recognizable word (or includes non-alphanumeric characters such as punctuation marks or other symbols). Conversely, when end users select their own more easily remembered passwords, the passwords may also be easier to crack. This study presents a new approach to entering passwords, which combines a high level of security with easy recall for the end user. The Check-Off Password System (COPS) is more secure than self-selected passwords as well as high-protection, assigned-password procedures. The present study investigates trade-offs between using COPS and three traditional password procedures, and provides a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of COPS. The study offers evidence that COPS is a valid alternative to current user authentication systems. End users perceive all password procedures tested to have equal usefulness, but the perceived ease of use of COPS passwords equals that of an established high-security password, and the new interface does not negatively affect user performance compared with that high-security password. Further research will be conducted to investigate long-term benefits.","Computer security; Password procedures; Technology acceptance model (TAM); User authentication",""

It is a super set of discretionary access control (DAC) and mandatory access control (MAC). Since DAC and MAC are useful in information flow control (which protects privacy within an application), RBAC can certainly be used in that control. Our research reveals that different control granularity is needed in different cases when controlling information flows within an application. An information flow control model should thus simultaneously offer different levels of control granularity. We designed a multiple-leveled RBAC model to offer multiple levels of control granularity, in which a level of RBAC controls a level of granularity. We called the model LnRBAC (n-leveled RBAC), which offer the following features: (1) it allows different control granularity in different cases, (2) it solves the covert channel problems caused by abnormal program stopping, (3) it adapts to dynamic object state change, (4) it controls method invocation through argument sensitivity (5) it allows purpose-oriented method invocation, (6) it controls write access precisely, and (7) it avoids Trojan horses. We implemented a prototype for LnRBAC and evaluated it.

US initiatives include creating a series of industry-specific Information Sharing and Analysis Centers to encourage government/industry collaboration on information security. Private sector firms also need stronger incentives to invest adequately in IT security. Moving from trust management to risk management, with widely available and well-functioning markets for insurance covering IT security risks, could go a long way toward strengthening such incentives. Although the insurance industry has developed new forms of cyber insurance, coverage is limited, and few businesses now purchase these policies. Problems include lack of underwriting standards, little experience on which to base premiums, numerous exclusions and limits on liability, and an underdeveloped reinsurance market. Possible ways for government to spur insurance market expansion are explored, such as participating in standards development, mandating cyber insurance, facilitating reinsurance, or indemnifying catastrophic losses. In the end, rewarding IT security in the marketplace will likely require legislative changes to define liabilities more clearly and relate them to risk management principles and practices. © 2004 Frank Cass & Co.

Several public and private sector organisations were selected to participate in the investigation. This study is descriptive in nature. Its main findings suggest that security concerns have been the most prominent risk factors and have overtaken the other risk issues (e.g. loss of control, hidden costs) which were thought to be the most serious in dealing with IS/IT outsourcing in the Kuwaiti environment. The causes of such concerns are also addressed. The findings also provide an insight into how outsourcing practices, as an information system strategy, are managed in the context of Kuwait. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Information security; IT outsourcing; Private sector; Public sector","Decision making; Information technology; Outsourcing; Risk assessment; Security of data; Telecommunication services; IT outsourcing; Private sector; Public sector; Information management"

Another emerging priority among these institutions is collaborative working environments. Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is among the many universities and colleges developing and offering Computer and Network Security curriculum. However, we believe that our innovative approach to this new curriculum is unique because of the collaborative nature of the ""ABC Defense Lab Project"" recently implemented across course boundaries. The Information Technology Department offers a Bachelor of Science Degree in Applied Networking and Systems Administration (ANSA). Within this degree, the curricula is distinctly segmented between the two areas. The networking curriculum studies the infrastructure that ties all the systems together. Students learn about the protocols and technologies required to design, implement, troubleshoot and maintain a complete local area network. The systems administration curriculum studies what is happening ""inside the box"". Students once again learn about the design, implementation, troubleshooting and maintenance, but here the focus is on the servers and desktop systems required to run within a company. Within the ANSA Bachelor of Science Degree Program, two courses are offered to undergraduate students: Computer Systems Security and Network Security. These courses serve to provide conceptual and practical instruction in the aforementioned areas. The ABC Defense Lab Project was initially introduced in the Systems Administration Security course. Students were assigned membership in one of three teams: Team A, Team B or Team C. Ten to 15 students made up each of the three teams. Each team was provided with a set of equipment to configure, secure and eventually defend against attacks from the other two teams. Since this was a project within the Systems Administration Security course, the focus was on securing the systems and not the network. As the Network Security course was first offered approximately one year after the initial offering of the Systems Administration Security course, a very similar project was assigned. However, the focus was of course on designing, building, securing, and defending the network infrastructure. Although the project was successful in both courses, there were some drawbacks. Namely, the System Administration Security students still needed a network on which to run their systems and the Network Security students still needed systems on their network to be able to provide services. For the students in each course, this detracted from the task at hand; Systems Administration Security or Network Security, because they had to deal with the other side of the issue. While these two courses were originally designed independently of one another, in the Spring Quarter of the 2003 academic year, Professors Sharon Mason and Daryl Johnson took a new approach to teaching this security curriculum. In this new approach students from each of the two classes worked together in one of three teams (Team A, Team B, or Team C) to design, implement and secure a network with computer systems offering services. The teams were then instructed to work with one another across course boundaries; Team A from the Systems Security class worked with Team A from the Network Security class, etc. In the end each of the teams defended their own network and systems while attempting to exploit security flaws in the other teams' network and systems. This is the first time in the ANSA Degree Program that such a project has been attempted at this scope and scale across course boundaries. This paper explores the triumphs and breakdowns of this innovative collaborative class project. The successes and failures of both the students and the instructors are reviewed to provide insights as to the lessons learned from this experience.","Information Assurance; Network Security; Security; Systems Security","Computer networks; Curricula; Information technology; Personal computers; Project management; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Information assurance; Network security; System administration; Systems security; Computer supported cooperative work"

Yet despite all of this attention, there is some confusion about what is actually encompassed by those terms. There are some obvious components, such as cryptography and access control. However, the list of undisputed topics is not long or well-developed, and many questions arise as to whether a typical computer science department can offer all of the topics involved. That there are only a few universities that teach a comprehensive curriculum in these topics serves to illustrate the imprecise nature of the field. Many professionals have taken to describing it as ""information security"" or ""information assurance"" to distinguish that the focus is not on computers and networks, but on the information they hold and process. This talk will present a more comprehensive view of the area than simply within the confines of CS/CE. The speaker has been teaching information security for nearly 20 years and has developed a view that spans many traditional disciplines.

Based on the statistical observations on the difference histogram of images, a new steganalytic technique capable of a reliable detection of the spatial LSB (least significant bit) Steganography is proposed. Translation coefficients between the difference histograms are defined as a measure of the weak correlation between the LSB plane and the remained bit planes, and then used to construct a classifier to discriminate the stego-image from the carrier-image. The algorithm can not only detect the existence of hidden messages embedded using LSB replacement in images reliably, but also estimate the amount of hidden messages exactly. It has a distinct physical meaning and can be implemented conveniently. Experimental results show that for raw losslessly stored images, the new algorithm has a better performance than the RS (regular singular) steganalysis method and improves the computation speed significantly. The new approach is also applicable for color images.","Difference histogram; Information hiding; LSB (least significant bit); Regular singular steganalysis; Steganalysis; Steganography","Error analysis; Image processing; Reliability; Security of data; Difference histogram; Information hiding; Least significant; Regular singular steganalysis; Steganalysis; Steganography; Information management"

GETI is an electronic consumption tax architecture to provide “all-in-one” tax and e-payment services through a trusted third party (TTP). GETI is designed to streamline the overall cyber-taxation process and provide simplified and transparent tax invoice services through an authorized TTP. To ensure information security, GETI incorporates Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based digital certificates and other data encryption schemes when calculating, reporting, paying, and auditing tax in the electronic commerce environment. GETI is based on the OECD cyber-taxation agreement that was reached in January 2001, which established the taxation model for B2B and B2C electronic commerce transactions. For the value added tax systems, tax invoices are indispensable to commerce activities to provide documentation to prove the validity of commercial transactions. As paper-based tax invoice systems are gradually phased out and are replaced with electronic tax invoice systems, there is an increasing need to develop a reliable, efficient, transparent, and secured cyber-taxation architecture. To design such an architecture, several desirable system attributes were considered, reliability, efficiency, transparency and security. GETI was developed with these system attributes in mind. © 2004 International Review of Public Administration.","Cyber-consumption tax; Cyber-taxation; Electronic commerce; Public key infrastructure; Taxation technology",""

This has happened at the La Nostra Famiglia Institution. Local push to high priority arose from several concurrent forces, like privacy both on the patient and on the doctor side, legal and ethical aspects. Recommendations on the protection of medical data require appropriate technical and organisational measures to be taken to protect personal data against unauthorised access, alterations or any other form of inappropriate processing. In the same time quick and easy access to patient information should be granted to authorised personnel to ensure proper and in time treatment of patients. A long lasting sequence of co-operative negotiation meetings between the CMO and the chief information officer (CIO) led to appropriate outline of policies.

This initiative is intended to provide approved tools, methods and guidance that may be applied consistently throughout the NHS and that will be underpinned through appropriate support and helpdesk services. This paper emphasises the need to consider a range of applicable topics when determining a responsible and extensible approach to the governance of information collected, used and shared by healthcare organisations.

In addition, this paper proposes a spiral-based roadmap tailored to the interoperability needs of existing systems. Initial phase of the spiral development emphasizes the nonintrusive and cost effective means towards enabling the islands of community interoperability via gateways; next phase proposes to replace these gateways with programmable, spectrally efficient wideband and highly available systems and subsequent phases provide the dynamically self-adaptive communication systems connectivity to the ubiquitous Internet backbone automatically. The communication services interoperability is key to realizing the vision of global interoperability across all platforms and programs. The existing communication systems provide domain-specific interoperability and are spotty in nature. To ascertain global interoperability, the Boeing Company has developed a framework called strategic architecture reference model (SARM) [1] based on layered abstraction of services similar to OSI/ISO and TCP/IP models. The SARM framework is tailored to meet the stringent information assurance requirements needed for operating under financial, real-time decision-making and enterprise environments. The SARM framework is based on the communication layer upon which information, application and human machine interface layers are built upon. This paper elaborates upon the issues and characteristics of the communication services in enabling the global interoperability.","","Adaptive systems; Decision making; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Interoperability; Man machine systems; Adaptive communication services; Gateways; Interface layers; Stringent information; Communication systems"

But to verify a multisignature, a verifier only needs to know the unique group public key. Harn and Ji et al. proposed two multi-signature schemes based on discrete logarithm problem. However, Lu et al. found that there was a weakness in these two schemes: If several members collude together, a multisignature of the group can also be viewed as a multisignature generated by honest members. Therefore, if necessary, malicious members would repudiate that they did not sign some multisignatures. To avoid this weakness, Lu et al, proposed two kinds of improvements in the key generation protocols of the two existing multisignature schemes. This paper presents an attack to show that Lu's improved schemes are still insecure. In our attack, a single malicious group member can control the group secret key, who can generate valid multisignature for any message on the behalf of the whole group without the help of other members. At the same time, honest members cannot detect this security flaw in the system, since the group can generate multisignature according to the prescribed protocols. Furthermore, our attack can also be applied to the original two schemes.","Cryptography; Digital signature; Information security; Multisignature","Security of data; Attack; Digital signature; Information security; Multisignature; Public key cryptography"

Our approach gains the advantages of both host and network based intrusion methods, and can practice both rule-based and anomaly detection.

The survey also found that organizations conduct some form of economic evaluation of their cyber security expenditures, with 55% using return on investment to quantify the benefits. CSI says however, the percentage of organizations reporting computer intrusions to law enforcement is on decline due to an organization's fear of damping its reputation.","","Costs; Electronic crime countermeasures; Industrial economics; Law enforcement; Security of data; Surveys; Cyber security expenditures; Cybersecurity; Denial of service (DoS); Economic evaluation; Computer crime"

With the introduction of this technology information security becomes an important issue, moreover when the EPR integrates several exam results and reports that need to be properly stored and managed. The Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department in Porto's Faculty of Medicine is implementing a centralized Electronic Patient Record, the HSJ.ICU, to integrate several departments' information that comprises mainly electronic reports. The provision for the integrity of these documents is essential. Usually, the users of the system have blind trust in the information they access. The HSJ.ICU is implementing a process that digitally signs reports automatically, and therefore does not interfere with system's usability. It also provides for simple key management with the use of only one public key pair focusing protection in one single point. The digital signature provides real trust in the way it prevents and detects inconsistencies or errors that may affect information integrity. The approach presented in this paper will guarantee that when there is the need to access patient reports, whether now or in 20 years' time, those are still trustable and valid to be integrated within the EPR.","","Electronic document identification systems; Error analysis; Health care; Information analysis; Medicine; Optimization; Patient treatment; Biostatistics; Electronic patient record (EPR); Healthcare information systems; Information integrity; Biomedical engineering"

The network identity of each user is the overall global set of these attributes constituting the various accounts.

The regulation requires organizations to conduct information-security risk assessments to ensure that their security programs effectively mitigate their risks. Because the regulation does not mandate a specific technique, many variants of risk assessments have been employed to satisfy the requirement. This paper examines limitations in process-based risk assessments used by many healthcare organizations to comply with the HIPAA risk assessment requirement. It specifically focuses on the following three limitations: (1) lack of detailed operational context, (2) limited analysis of combinatorial effects of risk conditions, and (3) the tendency for local optimization of risk mitigation efforts. © 2004 CARS and Elsevier B.V.","HIPAA; Incident response; Risk; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security",""

At the same time, the confirmer cannot cheat verifiers once he is involved in the procedure of signature verification. Furthermore, if it is necessary, the confirmer could convert confirmer signatures into standard ones such that the validity of these converted signatures can be publicly validated.

Corporations should realize that these threats to their online businesses have strategic implications to their business future and take proper measures to ensure that these threats are eliminated or significantly reduced so that consumer confidence in the Internet as an alternative means of shopping is maintained. These counter measures, coined as cybersecurity, have been developed to ensure the safety of consumer privacy and information and allow for a carefree shopping experience. There is need for the development of models that will allow corporations to study the effects of cybercrime on online consumer confidence and to counter through leveraging the benefits associated with the latest developments in cybersecurity.

In this context, information assurance (IA) refers to methodologies to protect engineering information by ensuring its availability, confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, authentication, access control, etc. In collaborative design, IA techniques are needed to protect intellectual property, establish security privileges and create 'need to know' protections on critical features. Aside from 3D watermarking, research on how to provide IA to distributed collaborative engineering teams is largely non-existent. This paper provides a framework for IA within collaborative design. It is based on a technique we call role-based viewing, which is achieved through integration of multi-resolution geometry and security models. In this way, 3D models are geometrically partitioned, and the partitioning is used to create multi-resolution mesh hierarchies that obscure, obfuscate, or remove sensitive material from the view of users without appropriate permissions. This approach is the basis for our prototype system FACADE (the Framework for Accesscontrol in Computer-Aided Design Environments), a synchronous multi-user collaborative modeling environment. In FACADE, groups of users work in a shared 3D modeling environment in which each user's viewing and modeling privileges are managed by a central access control mechanism. In this manner, individual users see only the data they are allowed to see, at the level of detail they are permitted to see it. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

As an effective measure to achieve information security, access control is important in WBA security. However, current approaches to access control on WBA are mostly based on individual user identity; hence they do not scale to enterprise-wide systems. In this paper, a new access control mechanism called TRBAC (task and role-based access control model for Web) is presented. The TRBAC model can meet the need to manage and enforce the strong and efficient access control technology in large-scale Web environments. The implementation of TRBAC on the Web is also illustrated.

An audio watermarking algorithm based-on Modulated Complex Lapped Transform (MCLT) is proposed. Using spectrum-warping technique that shifts spectrum coefficients non-linearly, a significant binary image is embedded in audio by modulating MCLT's angle frequency. In order to improve the security, some pretreatments for watermark are carried through before it is embedded to audio, such as repeat coding and interleaver.

However cryptographic protocols are very difficult to design and analyze due to the complexity of the cryptographic protocol execution, and a large number of problems are unsolved that range from the theory framework to the concrete analysis technique. In this paper, we build a new algebra called cryptographic protocol algebra (CPA) for describing the message operations with many cryptographic primitives, and proposed a new algebra model for cryptographic protocols based on the CPA. In the model, expanding processes of the participant's knowledge on the protocol runs are characterized with some algebraic notions such as subalgebra, free generator and polynomial algebra, and attack processes are modeled with a new notion similar to that of the exact sequence used in homological algebra. Then we develope a mathematical approach to the cryptographic protocol security analysis. By using algebraic techniques, we have shown that for those cryptographic protocols with some symmetric properties, the execution space generated by an arbitrary number of participants may boil down to a smaller space generated by several honest participants and attackers. Furthermore we discuss the composability problem of cryptographic protocols and give a sufficient condition under which the protocol composed of two correct cryptographic protocols is still correct, and we finally offer a counterexample to show that the statement may not be true when the condition is not met.

Embedded systems, which will be ubiquitously used to capture, store, manipulate, and access data of a sensitive nature, pose several unique and interesting security challenges. Security has been the subject of intensive research in the areas of cryptography, computing, and networking. However, security is often mis-construed by embedded system designers as the addition of features, such as specific cryptographic algorithms and security protocols, to the system. In reality, it is an entirely new metric that designers should consider throughout the design process, along with other metrics such as cost, performance, and power. This paper is intended to introduce embedded system designers and design tool developers to the challenges involved in designing secure embedded systems. We attempt to provide a unified view of embedded system security by first analyzing the typical functional security requirements for embedded systems from an end-user perspective. We then identify the implied challenges for embedded system architects, as well as hardware and software designers (e.g., tamper-resistant embedded system design, processing requirements for security, impact of security on battery life for battery-powered systems, etc.). We also survey solution techniques to address these challenges, drawing from both current practice and emerging research, and identify open research problems that will require innovations in embedded system architecture and design methodologies.","Architectures; Battery Life; Cryptography; Design; Design Methodologies; Digital Rights Management; Embedded Systems; Performance; Security; Security Processing; Security Protocols; Software Attacks; Tamper Resistance; Trusted Computing; Viruses","Algorithms; Codes (symbols); Computer architecture; Computer software; Cryptography; Personal digital assistants; Reliability; Security of data; Sensors; Systems analysis; Battery life; Design methodologies; Digital right management; Security processing; Security protocols; Software attacks; Tamper resistance; Trusted computing; Embedded systems"

Extensive research has been devoted to the development of cryptographic algorithms that provide the theoretical underpinnings of information security. Functional security mechanisms, such as security protocols, suitably employ these mathematical primitives in order to achieve the desired security objectives. However, functional security mechanisms alone cannot ensure security, since most embedded systems present attackers with an abundance of opportunities to observe or interfere with their implementation, and hence to compromise their theoretical strength. This paper surveys various tamper or attack techniques, and explains how they can be used to undermine or weaken security functions in embedded systems. Tamper-resistant design refers to the process of designing a system architecture and implementation that is resistant to such attacks. We outline approaches that have been proposed to design tamper-resistant embedded systems, with examples drawn from recent commercial products.","","Algorithms; Analog to digital conversion; Computer hardware; Network protocols; Optimization; Security systems; Systems analysis; Cryptographic algorithms; Functional security mechanisms; Secure embedded systems; Tamper resistance mechanisms; Security of data"

Although many research papers have addressed the problem of DoS attacks, some drawbacks still exit. The major problem is this: when a responder receives a request or key message and system resources are required to verify that the request has been sent from a legitimate user, the additional computing time and memory storage involved provides an adversary the opportunity to launch a DoS attack. In order to prevent this attack, we present a new protocol called the Identity-Based dynamic access control filter (IDF), which checks every filter value on every received frame to determine if they have permission to enter the system and use system resources. In this paper we focus on wireless network protection, but the same concept can be applied to a wired network as well. A performance analysis of the critical step used in preventing a DOS attack is conducted and the result is compared with other Public Key-hosed schemes.","AAA; Denial of Service Attacks; Information Security; Wireless network","Electronic document identification systems; Internet; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Servers; Signal filtering and prediction; Authentication; Denial of Service (DoS) attacks; IP-based filters; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems"

The ability to make intelligent decisions about communications allows agents to achieve their goals more efficiently, and increase the security and survivability of an agent system. One application of this model includes a formal representation of information assurance for agent messaging on dynamic networks with possibly redundant routes. We use this framework to study the ""compromised host"" problem - specifically, how agents should react after an intruder has been detected. This is done by first quantifying the effect of the compromised host on the integrity of messages among agents; and then selecting a routing policy with respect to message integrity and the compromised host (e.g., rerouting to avoid the host or continuing to communicate through it). We provide examples of how this technique can be used to improve information assurance for agent-to-agent communications and information distribution in sensor networks. Empirical validation in the Secure Wireless Agent Testbed (SWAT) shows network awareness improves the survivability and efficiency of mobile agent systems.","","Graph theory; Mathematical models; Network protocols; Sensors; Telecommunication links; Ad hoc networks; Mobile agents; Network link layers; Software agents"

Increased use of information technology has made it necessary to introduce new codes of practice relating to the handling of confidential patient information. The 1998 Data Protection Act defines what is legal and appropriate regarding the use of such information and defines the responsibilities of those who record and use that information. The Act describes the rights of subjects who have information recorded about them and their forms of redress. National codes of practice on patient confidentiality are based on the legal requirements of the Act. Access to patient information systems needs to be controlled to prevent unauthorized access. Much of the process of information security is managed at Trust level, but all doctors need a basic knowledge of computer system security. As well as access control, security measures must try to ensure that stored information remains intact and yet available to all users who have authorization. This is the triad of confidentiality, integrity and availability. In attempting to achieve these aims some compromise is necessary because there is some degree of mutual incompatibility. The actual measures taken in each case depend on the sensitivity and importance of the information. The Act only states that appropriate security measures should be taken, they are not defined. Information security does not relate solely to computer systems; paper records, telephone messages and faxes are equally important. There are many technological aids to improving security that the NHS must consider, though for most doctors the essential issues are of awareness and a cultural change of practice. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed an information flow control model based on role-based access control (RBAC) for object-oriented systems, which is called OORBAC (object-oriented role-based access control). According to the experiences of using OORBAC, we found that a model allowing every secure information flow and blocking every non-secure flow is too restricted. We propose that the following flexible access control features should be offered: (a) non-secure but harmless information flows should be allowed and (b) secure but harmful information flows should be blocked. According to our survey, no existing model offers the above control. We thus revised OORBAC to offer the control. The revised OORBAC have been implemented and evaluated.

Honeynets are a creation of the IT security world intended to draw the attention of hackers, identify the tools in their toolkit, and learn their modus operandi. Our thesis is that Honeynets can be deployed safely in an educational environment to provide students with real-time security education. Honeynets provide vital information on current security threats, attacker tools, and attacker mentality. When implemented properly, Honeynets can also provide IT students with experience in a wide range of skills, helping to focus those skills on network and information security. Furthermore, the research that comes from Honeynets can be shared with IT security professionals to help raise awareness and increase security throughout the world. In a society where technology changes rapidly, the inability to provide IT students with the most current tools and information can quickly become a major detriment to IT education. Due to communication delays and the difficulty in keeping educators current in technology, IT students often receive outdated information.

Information security and information assurance concepts are integrated with the learning objectives of individual courses. This paper provides background information about the school and the existing programmes and describes an information security curriculum development process. The strategies and approaches adopted are justified through consultation with major stakeholders (industry and students). Some of the issues arising form the implementation of the information security curriculum such as the need to invest in resourcing are discussed, and possible future information security curriculum developments are briefly outlined.

Intellectual Property (IP) is needed in a field that merges current applications and technology, yet is not often taught. IP encompasses original thought, invention, and progress; the three traditional areas of IP are copyrights, trademarks, and patents. An information security professional cannot protect his or her interest, or the interests of the company, whether it be an invention, expression of idea, or some other non-tangible property, without understanding these three IP areas. Information security educators should understand that IP has not been incorporated into the disciplines, but easily could be. Educators should also note that by the lack of IP instruction, the graduates are ignorant as to the protection of creations. This impacts their futures as they will be entering the workplace, and without IP knowledge they may not protect their or the company's rights. This paper, written by a patent agent and patent attorney, both holding doctorate degrees in computer science and electrical engineering, respectively, will introduce the basic concepts of intellectual property and show ways to introduce IP into an information security curriculum.

Even though appropriate security approaches can be found, the resulting security level often remains unknown. It is a widely accepted principle that an activity cannot be managed well if it cannot be measured. Information security (IS) metrics offers work as a research field. This thesis focuses on studying the use of IS metrics in certain Finnish industrial companies and state institutions. The objective is to study the state-of-practise and its relation to the literature in the research field. The use of IS metrics is particularly studied from the perspective of processes. The aim is to reveal how development and implementation of the metrics is carried out in the organisations. In addition, the techniques used in implementation and analysis of metrics, as well as their usefulness and future targets are studied. The research consists of a literature study followed by a survey study, and an analytical phase. The survey study is implemented by conducting eight interviews in different industrial corporations and state institutions. The method used is a semi-structured, theme-centred interview. The results are categorised applying suitable classifications found in the literature and analysed using an interpretative analysis method. The survey clearly shows that measuring IS is important, but the benefits of measurements can only be seen when the metrics use is applied as a process, with the experience gained from the use of history data. Technical metrics and risk assessment metrics are commonly used, but there is a need to measure individual expertise as well as to automate and rationalise measurements. Most of the organisations do not use IS metrics as a process. However, there are intentions to implement an IS metrics process, as well as to integrate the IS metrics process into quality and business processes. Legislation, customers and technical development especially affect the future development of IS metrics.

The correctness issue becomes more important in Information Assurance applications where a protocol is designed to deal with hostile and unpredictable behavior of the processes and/or the network. The purpose of this paper is to provide a simulation-based methodology to validate the correctness of a candidate protocol. The methodology is based on state-machine modeling of the protocol in a context of its application-level goal and operating environment. The paper offers a 3-tier approach, wherein a validation model captures the external constraints to be satisfied at the protocol interface, the environment perturbations the protocol is subjected to, and the protocol internal rules and procedures. Discrete-event simulators, developed in a suitable modeling language (such as PROMELA), check if a protocol meets the safety and liveness conditions prescribed at external interface to the protocol under a given operating environment. The modularity and designer-friendliness of our validation approach allow simulating different candidate protocols with ease and flexibility. The paper illustrates our methodology with validation exercises on a 2-phase commit based majority voting protocol. © 2004 IEEE.","","Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Mathematical models; Network protocols; Combinatorial complexity; Communicating finite state machine (CFSM); Concurrent system; Image transfer; Concurrent engineering"

Its decryption requires no special computing devices and is implemented using only human vision: the proposed display appears as a random pattern to anyone who looks at it unless the person views the displayed image through a decoding mask. We have constructed code sets to represent grayscale and multicolored images. Each pixel in a secret image is expanded to a group of subpixels. The displayed image consists of black and white subpixels to encrypt a grayscale image. To encrypt a multicolor image, black, red, green, and blue subpixels compose the displayed image. The decoding mask consists of transparent and opaque subpixels. Every pixel is encrypted using a pair that is chosen at random. We have demonstrated the proposed secure display with an LCD panel and a transparency on which a decoding mask was printed. The secret image was visible for a viewer within the viewing zone, although viewers outside the viewing zone perceived it as a random dot pattern.","Encryption, viewing zone; Information security; Optical array logic; Visual cryptography","Cryptography; Data acquisition; Decoding; Information technology; Liquid crystal displays; Security of data; Optical array logic; Viewing zone; Visual cryptography; Image processing"

We show that complexity metrics are able to distinguish between FTP exploits and normal sessions within some margin of error. We then derive a new heuristic for complexity estimation using Minimum Description Length principles and develop a new complexity estimator and compression algorithm based on Grammar Inference using this heuristic. This estimator is used to provide meaningful models of unknown data sets.

This paper describes two field studies in which scenario-based training was used to teach information systems users how detect deception in the information they use. The first study provided deception detection training to human resource specialists who queried a database to get the need information to make decision about personnel in their organization. Deceptive data was planted in the database. The second provided training to communications specialists using a computer based training systems called Agent99. In both studies scenarios were developed as a foundation of the training programs provided. The use of the scenarios helped to keep the participants involved and focused on the training.

Within a virtual community, especially one also used to facilitate knowledge discovery, there are a number of privacy issues that must be addressed and resolved in ways other than through privacy laws and policies alone. This is due to the fact that, as to date, these laws have proved mainly ineffective and there is an ever growing concern by individuals about their privacy. Web surveys have identified that 82% of users have said improved privacy policies and methods would matter in web environments. Agarwal highlights the fact that a secure collaborative environment, such as a virtual community, needs to provide authentication, authorization, privacy and data integrity.

When evaluating existing military wireless communication devices/networks, one realizes that they have a tremendous limitation as to the rate at which the data can be transmitted. Most existing military wireless networks/devices transmit at much less than 500 Kbps, which is not acceptable. The commercial sector has developed wireless networks/devices that are based on the 802.11 protocol that has the ability to transmit at rates as high as 56 Mbps. While this rate is desirable, there are other limitations of the 802.11 protocol that make it unsuitable for a military environment. These include information security, transmission security, limited range and operation in a highly mobile environment This paper describes ViaSat's Secure Wireless Local Area Network (SWLAN) product that is based on a modified Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) 802.11 technology integrated with ViaSat's High Assurance type 1 (or Type 3) Inline Network Encryptor (INE) technology. With the combination of 802.11 and INE technology, this product will provide extremely secure (both COMSEC and TRANSEC) mobile wireless data communication at distances greater than 1 kilometer (km) at rates up to 56 Mbps in a battlefield environment.

To synchronize the tent map between the transmitter and the receiver, the controller is designed using H∞ methodology.

A popular method to embed data in an image is to modify the least significant bit (LSB) plane of the host image. It is shown that the statistical changes induced by data embedding can be used to estimate the embedding capacity, leading to a new staganographic technique. Two parameters are defined based upon histogram of the image under investigation, and a test embedding is performed to observe the change in these parameters. This gives an estimate of possible stego-data. The proposed method uses a secondary embedding, which not only reveals the presence of a secret message, but also provides an estimate of the payload. The algorithm can easily be implemented with low computational complexity.

In wavelet-based video compression methods such as 3-D set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm and Motion-JPEG2000, wavelet coefficients in discrete wavelet transformed video are quantized into a bit-plane structure and therefore BPCS steganography can be applied in the wavelet domain. 3-D SPIHT-BPCS steganography and Motion-JPEG2000-BPCS steganography are presented and tested, which are the integration of 3-D SPIHT video coding and BPCS steganography, and that of Motion-JPEG2000 and BPCS, respectively.

It is used to detect various attacks from distributed network environment. But attack behaviors are becoming more complicated with the development of network techniques so that it is becoming more difficult to detect them. In order to overcome the shortcomings of current intrusion detection techniques, a novel hierarchical model of multi-level detection intrusion is proposed. The model utilizes the intelligent, mobile and self-adaptive characteristics of agent and its distributed collaborative calculation capability. So it can detect complicated attacks effectively. The adoption of the clone and migration mechanism of agent and the security communication protocol enhances the security and collaborative detection capability of the model. communication load is reduced effectively and intrusions can be detected and responded as quickly as possible.

It provides a new visual model, which can exactly evaluate the Just Noticeable Distortion (JND) tolerance of human visual system. The watermarking algorithm is designed to address the issue of how to improve the robustness and the security of the embedded watermark according to the image content In order to improve the robustness and transparency, the method is first developed to determine significant ridgelet subbands and to select a couple of significant ridgelet coefficients in these subbands automatically, then the watermark bits are inserted in the visual significant ridgelet coefficients without exceeding the maximum strength of JND. With the spread of spectrum technique and the secret key protection, the security of the embedded watermark is also guaranteed very well. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve a better tradeoff between the robustness and transparency.","Digital watermark; Information security; Ridgelet transform; Wavelet transform","Algorithms; Communication; Image processing; Multimedia systems; Robustness (control systems); Security of data; Transparency; Vision; Wavelet transforms; Frequency-domain watermarks; Just noticable distortion (JND); Ridgelet transform; Video communication; Digital watermarking"

Extensive research was performed by collecting information from throughout the World Wide Web to include sites such as the National Security Agency's Homepage, the Information Assurance Technical Framework Homepage, the Workshop for Application of Engineering Principles to System Security Design, as well as many others. This research realized the following findings: (1) IA is dangerously left out of systems engineering processes; (2) a consortium from academia, industry and the federal government have formalized ISSE and its processes; (3) federally sponsored and industrially sponsored professional certifications exist for security engineers practicing ISSE; (4) ISSE, however, is not greatly used today due to a lack of understanding and a perceived high cost; (5) end-users are beginning to understand IA and are calling for more secure systems. This paper was written to illustrate a way forward, a method to bring ISSE to the frontlines of systems engineering and bring to life a notional concept of Designing for Security. This paper does not provide quantitative analyses as to the benefits of ISSE vs. the initial up front costs; however, further research should be accomplished in the future to address this. In conclusion, I recommend that ISSE must be identified as a critical component of the systems engineering lifecycle and be properly utilized to ensure that future products meet the IA demands of the end user. To achieve this, academia must build degree programs to educate ISSE and incorporate ISSE into existing degree programs; industry and the federal government must both embrace these principles and apply these techniques to their post-production, active engineering as well as new program developments.

In this paper, we present a robust signature-based malware detection technique, with emphasis on detecting obfuscated (or polymorphic) malware and mutated (or metamorphic) malware. The hypothesis is that all versions of the same malware share a common core signature that is a combination of several features of the code. After a particular malware has been first identified, it can be analyzed to extract the signature, which provides a basis for detecting variants and mutants of the same malware in the future.

Today's data networks are protected by human operators that are exceedingly overwhelmed by the massive information overload through false alarm rates of the protection mechanisms. This paper studies the role of alarm reduction and correlation in supporting the security administrator in an enterprise network. We present an architecture that incorporates intrusion detection systems as sensors, and provides improved alarm data to the human operator or to automated actuators.

Now, there are various synchronous and asynchronous tools for external and internal network and host intrusion detection and mitigation using models ranging from signature scanning and pattern matching, to statistical anomaly detection. Although modern tools are much more advanced, they still have many limitations, shortcomings, and open issues.

Unlike the traditional governments, an E-government takes on a new look with its framework and operation mode more suitable for the contemporary era. In fact, it is a basic national strategy to promote China's informatization by means of E-government construction. This talk firstly introduces the basic concepts and relevant viewpoints of E-government, then reviews the development process of E-government in China, and describes the current states, present problems and development strategies of E-government in China.

Information sharing, by itself, is better understood and has been used in many different settings. However, information security related issues concerning data accesses could be addressed using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). RBAC has been shown to support traditional access control mechanisms e.g., Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and has been proven as a favorable alternative. There has been a lot of work done in the specification of RBAC. Currently it is being extended extensively with various constraints so that it can support diverse domains in the authorization management of data. With current systems, RBAC is enforced on a need basis rather than in a generalized way. Using these systems in diverse domains is questionable, since these systems solely provide need-based support. In this paper, we describe the Event-Driven approach, a generalized approach to enforce RBAC, its current and future extensions, so that it can be used in the authorization management of data providing information security.","","Computer hardware description languages; Database systems; Hierarchical systems; Java programming language; Mapping; Public policy; Standards; XML; Cardinality constraints; Data management; Mandatory access control (MAC); Role-based access control (RBAC); Security of data"

In this paper, we present a method that overcomes this limitation by using redundant information present in the temporal domain to detect covert messages in the form of Gaussian watermarks.

Students collaboratively prepare lectures and labs as part of an IT security teaching model. Their enthusiasm in using the security lab as a playground follows a pedagogical approach of active learning and persistent student-led teams.

In this paper, a biometric authentication model is presented to enhance information security in ad-hoc networks. Using this model, a peer is authenticated with biometrics when joining an existing group even without the presence of an authentication server. ©2004 IEEE.","Ad-hoc networks; Biometrics; Information security; User authentication","Computer architecture; Database systems; Mathematical models; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personal computers; Personal digital assistants; Security of data; Servers; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad-hoc networks; Biometrics; User authentication; Wireless networks; Computer networks"

Among all insider threats, information theft is considered the most damaging in terms of potential financial loss. Moreover, it is also especially difficult to detect and prevent, because in many cases the attacker has the proper authority to access the stolen information. According to the 2003 CSI/FBI Computer Crime and Security Survey, theft of proprietary information was the single largest category of losses in the 2003 survey totaling $70.1 million or 35% of the total financial loss reported in that survey. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of an industrial-strength solution called Display-Only File Server (DOFS), which can transparently and effectively stop information theft by insiders in most cases, even if the insiders have proper authorities to read/write the protected information. The DOFS architecture ensures that bits of a protected file never leave a DOFS server after the file is checked in and users can still interact with the protected files in the same way as if it is stored locally. Essentially, DOFS decouples ""display access"" from other types of accesses to a protected file by providing users only the ""display image"" rather than the bits of the files, and applies the thin-client computing model on existing client-server applications.

The key question of our procedures is the design of dispersion-compensated optical processors by combining a small number of diffractive and refractive lenses. Our optical configurations provide, in a first-order approximation, the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of the input signal in a single plane and with the same scale for all the wavelengths of the incident light. In this way, our achromatic hybrid systems allow us to reconstruct color holograms with white light. These achromatic hybrid (diffractive-refractive) systems are applied, in a second stage, for implementing color processing operations with white light, such as color pattern recognition. In this direction, we design also a technique to encrypt color input objects into computer generated color holograms, which are decrypted optically with an achromatic joint transform correlator architecture under white-light illumination. Finally, we describe a totally-incoherent optical processor that is able to perform color processing operations under natural illumination (both spatially and temporally incoherent). This system is applied to perform color pattern recognition and optical encryption operations under natural light.

Coherent ultrashort light pulse CDMA is one of the promising systems for optical local area networks due to the advantages of asynchronous transmission, high information security, multiple access capability, and optical processing. Nonlinear optical thresholder is based on frequency chirping induced by self-phase modulation (SPM) in optical fiber, and discriminates the ultrashort pulse from multiple access interference (MAI) having picosecond duration. Our results show that the nonlinear optical thresholder can discriminate 400-fs ultrashort pulse from ≈100-ps MAI even if a response time of photodetector is limited to 100-ps, and that the system performance does not always become better as the total number of users becomes smaller because of thermal noise, which is unique characteristic to this system. © 2004 IEEE.","","Bit error rate; Code division multiple access; Dispersions; Fiber optic networks; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Nonlinear optics; Optical communication; Phase modulation; Signal processing; Topology; Transmitters; Electrical signals; Full-width at half-maximum (FWHM); Optical signals; Photoelectrons; Ultrashort pulses"

It is expected that these small devices, referred to as sensor nodes, will be mass-produced, making production costs negligible. Individual sensor nodes have a nonrenewable power supply and, once deployed, must work unattended. For most applications, we envision a massive random deployment of sensor nodes, numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands. Aggregating sensor nodes into sophisticated computation and communication infrastructures, called sensor networks, will have a significant impact on a wide array of applications, including military, scientific, industrial, health, and domestic, as illustrated in Figure 33.1. The fundamental goal of a wireless sensor network is to produce, over an extended period of time, meaningful global information from local data obtained by individual sensor nodes. It is expected that networking unattended wireless sensors will have a significant impact on the efficiency of many military and civil applications, such as combat field surveillance, intrusion detection, and disaster management. Wireless sensor networks process data gathered by multiple sensors to monitor events in an area of interest. For example, in a disaster management scenario, a large number of sensors can be dropped from a helicopter. Networking these sensors can assist rescue operations by locating survivors, identifying risky areas, and making the rescue crew aware of the overall situation. On the military side, the use of wireless sensor networks can limit the need for personnel involvement in the usually dangerous reconnaissance missions. Homeland security applications — including law enforcement, remote reconnaissance, monitoring, surveillance, and security zones ranging from persons to borders — can benefit enormously from the use of an underlying wireless sensor network. Similarly, medical, biological, scientific, and industrial applications can exploit wireless sensor networks to complement traditional data gathering, data fusion, and pattern matching capabilities. Wireless sensor networks also are key to the emerging “smart spaces,” which will include numerous sensor nodes interacting with the physical world to provide information services almost everywhere and at all times. However, a wireless sensor network is only as good as the information it produces. In this respect, perhaps the most important concern is information security. Indeed, in most application domains, sensor networks will constitute an information source that is a mission-critical system component and thus require commensurate security protection. Security must be provided although sensor nodes are unattended and vulnerable to tampering.5. © 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

While a public norm enforcer may be feasible in many situations, private norm enforcement may, and frequently does, complement or substitute for public enforcement. Private enforcement of cybersecurity is often subsidized, primarily in nonpecuniary manners (e.g., by exemption from antitrust laws). These subsidies may be necessary to capture the positive externalities of providing security to the network, but they also bias private parties' incentives and may result in the formation of inefficient security associations that are beneficial to their members only due to the subsidy. To mitigate this concern, subsidies should be awarded only to associations that are likely to be effective in enforcing norms on the network participants. This article offers a framework for assessing the likelihood that an association would become an effective norm enforcer. Norms that are expensive to enforce are rarely enforced by newly formed private legal systems (PLSs) because the effectiveness of mechanisms used to secure compliance (e.g., the threat of exclusion) depends on the PLSs ability to confer benefits on their members, and newly formed PLSs do not yet confer such benefits. Preexisting functionality inexpensively enhances a PLS's ability to enforce norms, and therefore most PLSs rely on preexisting institutions that already benefit members, typically by regulating norms that are not very costly to enforce. © Cambridge University Press 2006 and 2009.","",""

The survey consisted of over 250 respondents. The experiment consisted of 30 subjects and the analysis utilized a χ2 goodness of fit test.

Businesses spent about 8.75 billion to exterminate the infamous Love Bug. Perhaps far more important are the hidden costs of self-protection and losses from service interruption. Unlike traditional crime, which terrorizes all but has far fewer direct victims, cybercrime impacts the lives of virtually all citizens and almost every company. The Computer Security Institute and the FBI recently released the results of a study of 538 companies, government agencies, and financial institutions. Eighty-five percent of the respondents reported having security breaches, and 64% experienced financial loss as a result (Hatcher 2001). Because this problem is growing on a daily basis, it is imperative that society identify the most economically efficient way of fighting cybercrime. In this volume, the authors present a cross section of views that attempt to identify the true problems of cybersecurity and present solutions that will help resolve these challenges. In the first section, two authors outline some of the major problems of cybersecurity and explain how the provision of cybersecurity differs from traditional security models. Bruce Kobayashi examines the optimal level of cybersecurity as compared with traditional security.

It is the science of embedding information into the cover image viz., text, video, and image (payload) without causing statistically significant modification to the cover image. The modern secure image steganography presents a challenging task of transferring the embedded information to the destination without being detected. In this paper we present an image based steganography that combines Least Significant Bit(LSB), Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT), and compression techniques on raw images to enhance the security of the payload. Initially, the LSB algorithm is used to embed the payload bits into the cover image to derive the stego-image. The stego-image is transformed from spatial domain to the frequency domain using DCT. Finally quantization and runlength coding algorithms are used for compressing the stego-image to enhance its security. It is observed that secure images with low MSE and BER are transferred without using any password, in comparison with earlier works. © 2005 IEEE.","Cryptography; Discrete cosine transforms; Filtering; Frequency domain analysis; Image coding; Information security; Modems; Payloads; Steganography; Watermarking","Cosine transforms; Cryptography; Digital watermarking; Discrete cosine transforms; Filtration; Frequency domain analysis; Image coding; Image enhancement; Information filtering; Modems; Security of data; Steganography; Compression techniques; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Embedded information; Embedding information; Image steganography; Least significant bits; Payloads; Run-length coding; Image compression"

Integrating encrypted biometric information into smart cards not only solves the limited-capacity problem, but also strengthens security, since the smart card becomes a two-factor authentication device. The focus of this research was on preparing and testing the feasibility of biometric data for a smart card using a hash junction. In the project, the hash function, message digest (MD5), was used to convert the biometric information into a fixed-length string called digest. MD5 was tested for non-collision and portability on two platforms. Windows and Linux, to verify the reliability of its output.

In this essay, we question that state of affairs. Our purpose is not to weigh in on the details - for example, whether liability should sound in negligence or strict liability, or whether liability is in this instance best implemented by statute or via gradual common law development. Rather, our aim is to challenge the recent trend in the courts and Congress away from liability and toward complete immunity for Internet service providers. In our view, such immunity is difficult to defend on policy grounds and sharply inconsistent with conventional tort law principles. Internet service providers control the gateway through which Internet pests enter and reenter the public network. Service providers should therefore bear some responsibility not only for stopping malicious code but also for helping to identify those individuals who originate it. Computer viruses and related strains of Internet contagion impose a significant cost on the many individuals and entities that rely on Internet access for commerce, research, and communication. The U.S. government has responded to this problem with efforts to identify and deter those who create and propagate Internet pests. Thus, for example, both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security allocate substantial resources to the battle against cybercrime, and Congress has passed a number of criminal statutes designed to target the troublemakers who create Internet viruses and other forms of malicious computer code. © Cambridge University Press 2006 and 2009.","",""

During the transition, the shipboard telephone system, including the private branch exchange (PBX) will be connected to a VoIP gateway. This is termed “trunked voice.” The standard VoIP gateway used a G.729 Codec which put 10 bytes of data in each packet and produced 100 packets per second (PPS). An optimized VoIP gateway put 50 bytes of data in each packet and this allowed a reduced packet rate, i.e., it produced 20 PPS. Two new bandwidth-efficient IPSec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESPv3) modes were modeled [2]. The first mode, tunnel mode, encrypts the entire IP packet and adds a new IP header. The second mode, transport mode, encrypts the payload of the original packet, but not the IP header. A proposed implementation of these modes by the High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) program is expected to produce a cryptographic overhead of 16 octets [3] and was modeled in this report. The efficiency of the standard VoIP gateway with the INE in tunnel mode was 20%. The efficiency with the INE in transport mode was 34%. When the VoIP gateway bypassed the INE, and compressed Real Time Protocol (cRTP) header compression was used, the standard VoIP gateway produced an efficiency of 87%. When a transport mode INE was used with the optimized VoIP gateway, the efficiency was 85%. An unexpected result was observed. The standard VoIP gateway could saturate a typical first generation INE with as few as four calls. Two solutions were considered: 1) a faster INE, 2) optimized VoIP with a slower INE. The faster INE allowed a 512 Kbps SATCOM link to carry 8 VoIP calls, but used all the available bandwidth. The optimized VoIP gateway allowed up to 20 calls on a slower INE, and each call used significantly less SATCOM bandwidth. The interaction of the IA architecture with VoIP should be carefully considered in future DoD converged networks. © 2005 The MITRE Corporation.

These expenditures cover everything from simple door locks on private homes to elaborate security systems and private security guards. They are in addition to and often complement public law enforcement expenditures. They also differ from public law enforcement expenditures in that they are aimed at the direct prevention or reduction of loss and not necessarily at deterring crime through ex post sanctions. A growing and important subset of private security expenditures are those related to cybersecurity (see Introduction and Chapter 5). Private security expenditures are important given the decentralized nature of the Internet and the difficulties in applying traditional law enforcement techniques to crime and other wealth-transferring activities that take place in cyberspace. These include difficulties in identifying those responsible for cybercrimes, difficulties arising from the large volume and inchoate nature of many of the crimes, and difficulties associated with punishing judgment-proof individuals who are eventually identified as responsible for cyberattacks. As a consequence, those responsible for cyberattacks may perceive both that the probability of punishment is low and that the size of the sanction (when punishment occurs) is small; the final result will be a low expectation of penalty and inadequate deterrence (Becker 1968). Although individuals and businesses have made significant private investments in cybersecurity, there is a concern that leaving the problem of cybersecurity to the private sector may result in an inadequate level of protection for individuals, firms, and critical networks. © Cambridge University Press 2006 and 2009.","",""

In VOP encryption, the intra-encoded VOP is encrypted by inter-block permutation, the intra-encoded code blocks are encrypted by bit-plane permutation and coefficient sign encryption, and the other code blocks are encrypted by motion vector encryption. In VOL encryption, the basic VOLs are encrypted while others left unchanged. It can obtain high speed, for only parts of VOLs are encrypted. And it supports direct bit-rate control, which means that the encrypted images can also be decrypted correctly after recompression or bit-rate conversion. What's more, it is more robust to transmission errors than traditional ciphers since the errors causing in the encrypted bit-stream cannot spread out. These properties make it suitable for secure multimedia transmission over network, such as Video-on-Demand systems, multimedia communication networks, mobile multimedia or wireless multimedia networks, and so on.","Data encryption; Information security; Multimedia encryption; Video encryption; Video transmission","Cryptography; Image compression; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multimedia systems; Security of data; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Data encryption; Multimedia encryption; Video encryption; Video transmission; Algorithms"

This went well, except that our business lacked focus. Every new job had to be found and sold from scratch. We realized that we had to focus on a specific market if we wanted to achieve stability and growth. We chose High Assurance Software as it was a natural fit both for our technology and our expertise, further narrowing our attention to information assurance (IA).Why IA? Because there are challenging assurance requirements here for which functional languages and other semantics-based techniques can be very relevant, especially in the handling of information that cross security classification boundaries. Currently there are very few systems that are trusted enough to span from unclassified to secret, so many US government employees have to have two or three separate computers on their desk, each connected to totally disconnected networks that each exist at a single classification level. Information is kept separate by air gaps - and sometimes it doesn't get through to the people who need it. To be permitted to span multiple classification domains, a system must satisfy many stringent engineering and assurance requirements, including the application of formal and semi-formal techniques. The challenges we had to confront in maturing Galois as a company - such as the need for focus, and the importance of brand, for example - provide powerful lessons that may be relevant to the broader functional language community as it continues to seek wider acceptance of its tools and technology.","","Computer aided software engineering; Computer programming; Computer programming languages; Information retrieval; Information technology; Quality assurance; Semantics; Functional languages; Galois Connection Inc (CO); Glasgow University; Information assurance (IA); Computer software"

Using important network data (DoS relevant features), we have developed kernel machine based and soft computing detection mechanisms that achieve high detection accuracies. We also present our work of identifying DoS pertinent features and evaluating the applicability of these features in detecting novel DoS attacks. Architecture for detecting DoS attacks at the router is presented. We demonstrate that highly efficient and accurate signature based classifiers can be constructed by using important network features and machine learning techniques to detect DoS attacks at the boundary controllers. © 2004 IEEE.","Data reduction; Denial of service attacks; Feature ranking; Information assurance; Intrusion detection; Machine learning","Bandwidth; Computer simulation; Data reduction; Information analysis; Learning systems; Mathematical models; Real time systems; Routers; Denial of service attacks; Feature ranking; Information assurance; Intrusion detection; Security of data"

The traditional method of conducting a risk analysis is technology-driven and has several shortcomings. First, its focus on technology is at the detriment of considering people and processes as significant sources of security risk. Second, an analysis driven by technical assets can be overly time-consuming and costly. Third, the traditional risk analysis method employs calculations based largely on guesswork to estimate probability and financial loss of a security breach. Finally, an IT-centric approach to security risk analysis does not involve business users to the extent necessary to identify a comprehensive set of risks, or to promote security-awareness throughout an organization. This paper proposes an alternative, holistic method to conducting risk analysis. A holistic risk analysis, as defined in this paper, is one that attempts to identify a comprehensive set of risks by focusing equally on technology, information, people, and processes. The method is driven by critical business processes, which provides focus and relevance to the analysis. Key aspects of the method include a business-driven analysis, user participation in the analysis, architecture and data flow diagrams as a means to identify relevant IT assets, risk scenarios to capture procedural and security details, and qualitative estimation. The mixture of people and tools involved in the analysis is expected to result in a more comprehensive set of identified risks and a significant increase in security awareness throughout the organization.","business process; data flow diagram; information security; risk analysis; risk management; risk scenario","Data flow analysis; Data flow graphs; Data transfer; Finance; Flowcharting; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Losses; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Security of data; Business Process; Data flow diagrams; Economic feasibilities; Information security risks; Qualitative estimation; Risk scenarios; Security requirements; Security risk analysis; Risk analysis"

Formalised in the 1990s, it has not seen the take up of accreditations that could be expected from looking at accreditation figures for other standards such as the ISO 9000 series. This paper examines why this may be the case by investigating what has driven the accreditation under the standard in 18 UK companies, representing a fifth of companies accredited at the time of the research. An initial literature review suggests that adoption could be driven by external pressures, or simply an objective of improving operational performance and competitive performance. It points to the need to investigate the influence of Regulators and Legislators, Competitors, Trading Partners and Internal Stakeholders on the decision to seek accreditation. An inductive analysis of the reasons behind adoption of accreditation and its subsequent benefits suggests that competitive advantage is the primary driver of adoption for many of the companies we interviewed. We also find that an important driver of adoption is that the standard enabled organisations to access best practice in Information Security Management thereby facilitating external relationships and communication with internal stakeholders. Contrary to the accepted orthodoxy and what could be expected from the literature, increased regulation and the need to comply with codes of practice are not seen as significant drivers for companies in our sample.","Adoption; Best practice; BS 7799; Information Security; ISO/IEC 17799; ISO/IEC 27001","Accreditation; Competition; Finance; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Security of data; Adoption; Best practices; Competitive advantage; Competitive performance; Information security managements; ISO/IEC; Iso/iec 17799; Operational performance; ISO Standards"

In response to this important legislation, NIST is leading the development of key information system security standards and guidelines as part of its FISMA Implementation Project (http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert.index. html). This high-priority project includes the development of security categorization standards; standards and guidelines for the specification, selection, and testing of security controls for information systems; guidelines for the certification review and accreditation of information systems; and guidelines for the continuous monitoring of controls to ensure they continue to operate as intended. This paper includes a discussion of NIST's FISMA risk management framework (RMF) and the suite of related standards and guidelines being developed by NIST to help federal agencies comply with FISMA requirements (i.e., the FISMA suite of documents). In addition, the paper discusses how agency systems will benefit from applying the FISMA RMF, and why the FISMA RMF and the related suite of standards and guidelines should be of interest to other government sectors (e.g., DoD) and to the commercial sector.","","Laws and legislation; Risk management; Security of data; Telecommunication industry; Wireless telecommunication systems; Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA); Risk management framework (RMF); Security controls; Standards"

The internet is poised to become the new method of exchange of data. This paper contributes in analyzing and studying the different solutions for the enterprises, which have several, separated branches connected for workflow and data exchange. For such connection, there are two alternative solutions: (i) building a private network which is very expensive, (ii) using the internet infrastructure but, this solution faces the security violation problems because of the internet open connectivity. Where the security may be considered as the most important criteria in designing such system; this paper introduces security and performance analysis, which emphasise that the best solution is to use the cheap internet infrastructure and proposes security methods to provide the confidentiality of company information. In this work a practical example for applying the information security methods. The main objective of this paper is to: (i) study the selection of the suitable security policy, where all security risks are considered so the threat to the data during transmission is minimised and data is fully protected, (ii) propose a network configuration that helps in such problems, (iii) study the most suitable architecture for such applications. The proposed solution can provide tremendous flexibility and cost savings as corporations extend their network to include remote employees, business partners and customers. However, the benefits of flexibility and cost reductions may be negated if the solution selected is lacking in any one of the user constrains or system requirements.

MORDA models include adversary models; attacks trees; user models; service provider models; and integration and analysis models. The process provides a method for determining an optimum allocation of system design and operation resources that will ensure an operable information system in a hostile and malicious operating environment. MORDA uses subject matter expert teams from various disciplines to collect data and incorporates expert knowledge on adversaries, information systems technologies, and operation of the information system in the mission environment.

For a MCS to perform better than a single classifier, it is crucial to select the appropriate fusion strategies.

Our approach is inspired by the slice & dice paradigm of On-Line-Analytical Processing (OLAP). We recall the basic ideas of OLAP, and show how they may be transferred to triadic contexts.

In this paper, we first propose a provably secure proxy signature scheme, which is based on a two-party Schnorr signature scheme. Then, we extend this basic scheme into designated-verifier proxy signatures (DVPS). More specifically, we get two versions of DVPS: weak DVPS and strong DVPS. In both versions, the validity of a proxy signature can be checked only by the designated verifier. In a weak DVPS scheme, however, the designated verifier can further convert such proxy signatures into public verifiable ones, while a strong DVPS scheme does not have the same property even if the designated verifier's secret key is revealed willingly or unwillingly. In addition, we briefly discuss some potential applications for DVPS.

Therefore, the objective of net-centricity is to create the military equivalent notion of commercial electronic marketplaces for information that can adapt to challenges associated with the fog of war. Net-centric goals include breaking down organization stovepipes and facilitating dynamic information sharing and management practices by leveraging the principles of self-organization and market forces. With respect to large global organizations like the USAF and the DoD, this is a challenge that influences a wide range of social, technical and programmatic issues.

Therefore, at the first, we will discuss the requirement of agent security on the Semantic Web and propose a method that the agent dynamically exchanges its authentication and authorization information using SAML(Security Assertion Markup Language). Because SAML doesn't need to share same security infrastructure and allows applications to exchange authentication and authorization information, it is suitable for securing the agent that plays various roles in heterogeneous platforms, dynamically changes their requirements, and acts on behalf of users with diverse access permission on the Semantic Web. In addition to this, since SAML is based on XML, it has an advantage of easy integration and extension without modification of legacy system and protocol on the Semantic Web.","Agent; Information Security; SAML; Semantic Web; Web Service","Agents; Information technology; Legacy systems; Network protocols; Security of data; Security systems; Semantics; XML; Authentication; Network security; Semantic Web; Web services; Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML); Security infrastructure; Semantic web; Web services; Access to resources; Authentication and authorization; Distributed systems; Financial information; Heterogeneous platforms; SAML; Sensitive informations; World Wide Web; Information use"

Key questions of the study were: 1) how the term security can be defined, 2) which parties are involved in the security business, in research and development and in the general national security activities in Finland, 3) what are the future challenges, visions and research needs of security, and 4) how total corporate security management can be modelled. Another study in this area was performed by the first author in 2002-2004 while at the Tampere University of Technology. This study investigated the need for internal and external co-operation in organisations using questionnaire surveys (n=276) and interviews (n=70) with personnel dealing with safety and security in six different large organisations. This paper discusses the need for co-operation between the previously mentioned sectors in safety and security management. The main purpose is to initially model the range of corporate security, and the idea of total safety and security management. Based on all the research carried out, principles and ideas for connecting the safety and security sectors at the corporate level will be presented. © 2005 WIT Press.","Co-operation; Risk management; Safety management; Security management","Industrial hygiene; Research; Risk management; Security of data; Security systems; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Co-operation; Corporate risk managements; Occupational health and safety; Questionnaire surveys; Research and development; Safety and securities; Safety management; Security management; Industrial management"

Even when we operate in good faith, the methods of verification available to us can be subverted by a skilled attacker. Misdirection, spoofing, social engineering are tools that are available to those who want to abuse society's trust. Trust is central to the workings of a vibrant modern society.

Characteristic for healthcare is still the slowness of information digitalization, especially electronical medical records (EMR). Still today, there are units in the Swedish healthcare sector that not computerized their medical record systems. Those systems which have been implemented are autonomous and when new requirements arise for better communication between different healthcare providers, organizations are caught in their old systems which can not communicate with each other. The legacy systems are too expensive to throw and give rise to new requirements to find solutions to integrate legacy systems and business processes in order to achieve interoperability between different healthcare organizations. Also requirements of effectiveness and cost benefits are other factors that give advantages to computerizing the whole healthcare sector. There are different reasons why the implementation of IT has been so slow in healthcare. One is security issues, especially when patient information is going to be managed. This paper includes an experience report about the security level at different healthcare providers in the Swedish healthcare sector. Different investigations have been made in the Western region of Sweden: one at two different units in the home healthcare of a municipality; and one at a hospital in order to find out how users manage security in the patient records. A third investigation concerns the research project VITA Nova Hemma, where system and network security have been studied in existing systems in the primary care, secondary care and home healthcare of a municipality. Results show variances at the security level of information security and common deficiencies both at the technical and administrative level. The authentication technique and the users' lack of security awareness and education are the main weaknesses. © The authors, except as noted.","","Information management; Information science; Interoperability; Legacy systems; Network security; Research; Societies and institutions; Authentication techniques; Health care providers; Healthcare institutions; Healthcare organizations; Healthcare sectors; Medical record systems; Patient information; Security awareness; Health care"

In this paper, we have developed a policy-oriented decision model based on object trust management to assist users in selecting reliable and secure information in an open system. In the proposed model, an object represents a topic or issue under discussion, and it may have multiple versions, each of which represents a subject's opinion towards the characteristics of that object. The developed trust-based decision model assists a user to select one object version with desired level of quality and security features from available versions of a given object. The model balances both positive and negative aspects of an object version, and an evaluator can explicitly specify, in form of a policy specification, which features of an object version are not acceptable and which features are favorable. A high-level policy language, called Selector, expresses the policy specification in an unambiguous way. Selector consists of primary and residual policy statements. It supports recursive function calls, and the invoked external functions are defined separately from the language itself. The proposed decision model doesn't guarantee to select the ""best"" version for a given object. Rather it ensures that the selected version meets a user's requirement for information integrity.","information integrity; information security policies; policy language; trust decision model; trustworthy computation","Finance; High level languages; Information systems; Information use; Recursive functions; Security of data; Security systems; Specifications; High level policies; Information assurance; Information integrity; Information security policies; Policy language; Policy oriented decisions; Policy specification; Trust decisions; Information management"

We lack the capability to quantify the value of information, particularly information that has been processed and aggregated. We also face many difficulties when attempting to measure information security, characterize threats, understand vulnerabilities, or even formulate and sustain any specific security posture. As a result, we can not measure our risk and therefore can not manage it. Our efforts to address this problem can be divided into two categories, legal/policy and technical.

From a legal perspective, protection of information is limited to fortification, in part because we lack sufficient attribution. From a technical perspective, we have built complex mountains of computer code on top of hardware architectures that will attempt to execute any arbitrary instructions. These systems cannot be effectively analyzed for vulnerabilities so as to ensure trustworthy and secure operation. Research is needed to address the systematic protection of information including information valuation, security metrics, strong attribution, trustworthy computing, sustainable security processes, and legal devices that will support comprehensive protection and risk management.","","Computer hardware; Information theory; Public policy; Risk management; Global economics; Information valuation; Security of data"

Furthermore information security management is addressed in order to demonstrate how information security should be implemented.

Non-interference was proposed some 25 years ago to give a precise, formal characterisation of the absence of information flows through a system, motivated in large part by the discovery of covert channels in access control models such as Bell-LaPadula. Intuitively, it asserts that altering Highs interactions with a system should not result in any observable difference in Lows interactions with the system. Superficially it appears to be a very natural and compelling concept but it turns out to harbor some surprising subtleties. Over the years various models of computation have been used to formalise non-interference. Typically these floundered on non-determinism, ""input/output"" distinctions, input totality and so forth. In the late 80's and early 90's, process algebras, in particular CSP, were applied to information security. In this talk I will briefly overview this approach and discuss how the concepts and results from process algebra shed light on these haunted corners of non-interference, including the role of non-determinism, unwinding results, composition, refinement and input/output distinctions. In particular, we argue that the absence of information flow can be characterised in terms of process equivalence, itself a delicate and fundamental concept. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.","","Algebra; Data transfer; Information analysis; Mathematical models; Process control; Authentication; Bell-LaPadula - access control models; CSP; Process algebras; Security of data"

Furthermore we show that a trust enhanced security framework can be deployed to maximize the utility of the mobile agent based e-commerce systems. This is due to one of the unique features of trust enhanced security solutions - the ability to use trust evaluation to ""weed out"" malicious entities.

Traditionally, military networks have employed application-specific (""stovepiped"") communications links but there is a significant effort to adopt network-centric architectures based on commercially available and technology. Transitioning to a network-centric architecture requires establishment and management of multiple network layers. Each layer adds its own overhead, and may require data processing and control signaling, adding to the required network capacity. Additionally, information assurance, quality of service, MANET, XML, and web service protocols and technologies add to the total traffic overhead. Since networks will be shared by multiple users at a given time, the traffic on various segments of the network is expected to be unpredictable and bursty. For achieving an acceptable performance level for unpredictable traffic scenario, the network capacity utilization should not exceed a threshold level. Additionally, network inefficiencies may originate from integration complexities of heterogeneous networks. This paper examines the capacity requirements for a variety of military applications supported by a network-centric architecture. In particular, the overhead and inefficiencies of Physical layer, Link layer, Network Layer, Transport layer and Application layer protocols will be examined. For each of these layers, a variety of commercial and military protocols, that enable net-centric applications, are discussed with emphasis on its impact on capacity planning.","","Network protocols; Quality of service; Telecommunication links; Telecommunication services; Telecommunication traffic; Wireless telecommunication systems; XML; Information assurance; Jamresistance; Network-centric architecture; Web service protocols; Military communications"

This is particularly relevant in the embedded domain, where the security solution should be customized to the needs of the target system, while considering other design objectives such as cost, performance, and power. Due to the increasing complexity and shrinking design cycles of embedded software, most embedded systems present a host of software vulnerabilities that can be exploited by security attacks. Many attacks are initiated by causing a violation in the properties of data (e.g., integrity, privacy, access control rules, etc.) associated with a ""trusted"" program that is executing on the system, leading to a range of undesirable effects. In this work, we develop a general framework that provides security assurance against a wide class of security attacks. Our work is based on the observation that a program's permissible behavior with respect to data accesses can be characterized by certain properties. We present a hardware/software approach wherein such properties can be encoded as data attributes and enforced as security policies during program execution. These policies may be application-specific (e.g., access control for certain data structures), compiler-generated (e.g., enforcing that variables are accessed only within their scope), or universally applicable to all programs (e.g., disallowing writes to unallocated memory). We show how an embedded system architecture can support, such policies by (i) enhancing the memory hierarchy to represent the attributes of each datum as security tags that are linked to it through its lifetime, and (ii) adding a configurable hardware checker that interprets the semantics of the tags and enforces the desired security policies. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in enforcing various security policies for several embedded benchmarks. Our experiments in the context of the Simplescalar framework demonstrate that the proposed solution ensures run-time validation of program data properties with minimal execution time overheads.

In the traditional three-layer architecture model, there is no specific structure and safeguard mechanism for the overall safety of the system. This paper analyzes the security problems of existing web application systems and proposes a new four-layer architecture model for secure web application systems. The four layers of this new architecture are: presentation layer, business layer, data layer and security control layer. Access control and communication security are implemented in our four-layer architecture by adding new functions on top of existing ones to the first three layers, i.e., presentation layer, business layer, and data layer. The new security control layer is mainly used to provide safety services, such as two-way certification of end to end communication, secrecy and integrity of communication data, undeniable service of end to end communication, algorithm of digital signature and security key distribution etc. This paper also defines functions for each layer and describes authentication, encryption, decryption and transmitting data flow for the new architecture. The deficiencies and security problems in the traditional three-layer architecture are resolved in the safeguard mechanism in our new four-layer architecture; moreover this four-layer architecture has preferable universality and opening performance. © 2005 World Scientific Publishing Co.

In order to achieve major effectiveness in getting an information security message across to a computer user, this paper discusses and demonstrates how his or her individual cognitive style should be considered when framing the risk message.

Consequently, organizations are having to prioritize the security of their computer systems in order to ensure that their information assets retain their accuracy, confidentiality, and availability. While the importance of the information security policy (InSPy) in ensuring the security of information is acknowledged widely, to date there has been little empirical analysis of its impact or effectiveness in this role. To help fill this gap, an exploratory study was initiated that sought to investigate the relationship between the uptake and application of information security policies and the accompanying levels of security breaches. To this end, a questionnaire was designed, validated, and then targeted at IT managers within large organizations in the UK, The findings presented in this paper are somewhat surprising, as they show no statistically significant relationships between the adoption of information security policies and the incidence or severity of security breaches.

Many cryptographic protocols, such as signcryption, threshold decryption and undeniable signature enabled by pairing require sending the result of the pairing function with private key as one of the input. Since private key is only known to its owner, the correctness of the result may not be easily verifiable (which requires solving the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem). In this paper, we introduce the notion of Verifiable Pairing, together with a concrete construction, to ensure the robustness of these protocols. Verifiable pairing is a useful primitive in many information security applications. As examples, we show how verifiable pairing can be applied in signcryption, threshold decryption and how it can help in fixing insecure protocol. In adding verifiability to threshold decryption, our solution is more efficient than the previous proposal in [21]. As a bonus result, we find that our scheme for verifiable pairing gives rise to a new identity-based signature that is provably secure in the random oracle model without using the forking lemma, assuming the hardness of the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.","Bilinear pairing; Cryptographic primitives; Cryptographic protocols; Exact security; ID-based cryptography; ID-based signature; Signcryption; Threshold decryption; Undeniable signature; Verifiable pairing","Electronic document identification systems; Mathematical models; Network protocols; Robustness (control systems); Security of data; Pairing function; Private key cryptography; Random oracle model; Signcryption; Cryptography"

This paper discusses the importance of protecting the confidentiality and privacy of patient health/medical records, and the challenges exhibited in enforcing this protection in a Grid environment. It proposes a novel algorithm to allow traceable/linkable identity privacy in dealing with de-identified medical records. Using the algorithm, de-identified health records associated to the same patient but generated by different healthcare providers are given different pseudonyms. However, these pseudonymised records of the same patient can still be linked by a trusted entity such as the NHS trust or HealthGrid manager.

This article reports on a Swedish project where a prototype system was developed and tested with several healthcare units. The experience shows several advantages and opportunities. For example, current information about patients can be transferred automatically between healthcare units; resource intensive manual tasks can be replaced with automated tasks; and long-term process monitoring and quality assessment can be enabled. However, introducing a process manager requires attention to issues of security, ethics and legality.

Therefore, the outputs of the sensors must be fused in an effective and intelligent manner in order to provide an overall view of the status of such systems. A unified architecture for intelligent alert fusion will essentially combine alert prioritization, alert clustering and alert correlation.

The proposed model employs a hybrid architecture in which our previously published encryption method based on virtual-optics scheme (VOS) can be used to encipher and decipher data while an asymmetric algorithm, for example RSA, is applied for enciphering and deciphering the session key(s). The whole information security model is run under the framework of international standard ITU-T X.509 PKI, which is on basis of public-key cryptography and digital signatures. This PKI-based VOS security approach has additional features like confidentiality, authentication, and integrity for the purpose of data encryption under the environment of network. Numerical experiments prove the effectiveness of the method. The security of proposed model is briefly analyzed by examining some possible attacks from the viewpoint of a cryptanalysis.","Asymmetric algorithm; Digital signatures; Information security; Public key infrastructure; Virtual-optics","Algorithms; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electromagnetic wave diffraction; Electronic document identification systems; Information technology; Mathematical models; Network protocols; Public key cryptography; Random processes; Asymmetric algorithms; Cryptanalysis; Public key infrastructures (PKI); Virtual-optics; Security of data"

To answer this, we need to know three things: what the systems are supposed to do, what they are not supposed to do, and what they actually do. All three are problematic. There is no expressive, practical way to specify what systems must do and must not do. And if we had a specification, it would likely be infeasible to show that existing computing systems satisfy it. The alternative is to design it in from the beginning: accompany programs with explicit, machine-checked security policies, written by programmers as part of program development. Trustworthy systems must safeguard the end-to-end confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information they manipulate. We currently lack both sufficiently expressive specifications for these information security properties, and sufficiently accurate methods for checking them. Fortunately there has been progress on both fronts. First, information security policies can be made more expressive than simple noninterference or access control policies, by adding notions of ownership, declassification, robustness, and erasure. Second, program analysis and transformation can be used to provide strong, automated security assurance, yielding a kind of security by construction. This is an overview of programming with explicit information security policies with an outline of some future challenges. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.","","Computational methods; Robustness (control systems); Security of data; Specifications; Computing systems; Declassification; Program development; Security policies; Computer programming"

Many information security problems may be solved with appropriate models of these devices and their interactions, giving a systematic way to handle the complexity of real situations. We present an approach, rigorous automated network security management, that front-loads formal modeling and analysis before problem solving, thereby providing easy-to-run tools with rigorously justified results. With this approach, we model the network and a class of practically important security goals. The models derived suggest algorithms that, given system configuration information, determine the security goals satisfied by the system. The modeling provides rigorous justification for the algorithms, which may then be implemented as ordinary computer programs requiring no formal methods training to operate. We have applied this approach to several problems. In this paper we describe two: distributed packet filtering and the use of IP security Emphasis IPsec gateways. We also describe how to piece together the two separate solutions to these problems, jointly enforcing packet filtering as well as Emphasis IPsec authentication and confidentiality on a single network. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Filtering routers; Formal methods; IP security protocols; Network security; Security management","Algorithms; Computer networks; Data communication systems; Network protocols; Routers; Automated network security management; Filtering routers; Formal method; IP security protocols; Security management; Security of data"

This phenomenon has created a new landscape in which the demand for trained professionals in computer security is extremely high. Colleges and universities are still adapting to this reality and different approaches to computer security instruction are being used throughout the world. Our main contributions in this paper are the identification and the analyses of three main categories of approaches to instruction in computer security: single-course, track, and thread. The single-course approach, which is highly popular, is one in which the student is offered a survey of several different topics in computer security in one course in the curriculum, often an elective. Although it provides considerable breadth of topics, it cannot provide depth since it is only introductory by design. In the track, concentration, or program approach the student takes a sequence of courses specialized in security and information assurance. The resources required to implement this approach are numerous and therefore it is not applicable to a wide variety of schools and departments. To illustrate the discussion of these first two approaches, we present an informal survey of courses and programs in computer security throughout the U.S. The thread approach is seldom advertised or implemented and is a compromise which bridges the gap between the single-course and the track approaches. This approach uses security and privacy as a unifying theme across the standard core Computer Science or Computer Engineering curricula. We argue that this approach can effectively meet the educational needs of the computer professional of today using a minimum of resources.","","Computer networks; Computer science; Computer software; Curricula; Data privacy; Global positioning system; Students; Cellular network; Computer engineering; Computer professional; Undergraduate courses; Security of data"

Developing efficient automatic system is a crucial task in the area of security analysis for cryptographic protocols. However, the security analysis for cryptographic protocols is very complex and difficult and a lot of unresolved problems still present in it, which causes some limitations on reliability and efficiency of previously available automatic systems. An efficient automatic analysis system (Security Protocol Analyzer, SPA) for cryptographic protocols is designed and implemented based on the CPA (Cryptographic Protocol Algebra) model and new analysis techniques. In this system, security properties of the cryptographic protocols are specified firstly, and then an effective proof search algorithm starting with the initial state is applied and tries to find all possible attack sequences on them. More than ten cryptographic protocols are analyzed successfully with this system, and moreover, a new attack instance is also found. The analysis results show that SPA has improved the analysis reliability and efficiency compared with other existing tools.

We give the necessary and sufficient conditions for this class of affine modular matrix transformations to be periodic, i.e., for the original image to be exactly recovered after repeatedly applying the same matrix transformation. We show that three types of different image scrambling transformations, which we have recently introduced, can be represented by one unified framework based on this affine modular matrix transformation. These transformations are the Arnold transformation, the Baker transformation and the Gray Code transformation. We also present a new class of scrambling transformations that can be represented by this unified framework. This class of transformation is based on Fibonacci matrices. We also show that these transformations can endure image attacks such as compression, added noise and loss of data packets.","Digital image scrambling; Information security; Modular matrix transformation","Information technology; Mathematical transformations; Matrix algebra; Packet networks; Security of data; Baker transformation; Data packets; Digital image scrambling; Fibonacci matrices; Gray code transformation; Information security; Modular matrix transformation; Image coding"

But study of signature based on general vector space secret sharing is very weak. Aiming at this drawback, the authors did some research on vector space secret sharing against cheaters, and proposed an efficient but secure vector space secret sharing based multi-signature scheme, which is implemented in two channels. In this scheme, the group signature can be easily produced if an authorized subset of participants pool their secret shadows and a group signature can not be generated if an unauthorized subset of participants pool their secret shadows. The validity of the group signature can be verified by means of verification equations. A group signature of authorized subset of participants cannot be impersonated by any other set of participants. Moreover, the suspected forgery can be traced, and the malicious participants can be detected.

The prevention can be achieved by controlling information flows. Many information flow control models have been developed. Since applications may cooperate, controlling information flows among cooperating applications is necessary. Our survey reveals that no existing model offers the control. We thus developed a model to control information flows among cooperating object-oriented applications. In designing the model, we require that cooperating applications communicate with one another through JAVA RMI (remote method invocation). Our model is based on the following considerations: when a RMI occurs, the security level of an argument should not be higher than that of the parameter receiving the argument's value, and the security level of a variable receiving a method return value should not be lower than that of the method return value. The model is agent-based. Moreover, different applications can embed different information flow control models. With this, the proposed model coordinates heterogeneous information flow control models. This paper presents our inter-application information flow control model. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

To answer these and related questions, we surveyed a select group of citizens on the uses of this technology for business as well as homeland security purposes.

We present an intrusion detection system model based on IPv6 Internet (IDSMIPv6) to address this challenge. Such a model consists of five modules i.e. intruder tracking, data flow analysis, disaster recovery, rapid capturing packets and address matching, and network blocking. The technique of coordination and interaction is introduced into the modules for realizing the coordination control among modules. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on this model builds the IPv6 signature library which supports the IPv4/IPv6 protocols and the transition mechanism. Simulations show that the percentage of false negative of IDS based on this model is around 5% and the percentage of false positive is around 8% in the speed of 100 M. The data capturing is based on dynamic cataloging analysis and processing of the parallel data. The data capturing sub-system which is made up of several detectors and an analyser can capture all packets for analysis under the condition of five hosts in the speed of 400 M or seven hosts in the speed of 800 M. The intruder tracking can record the source of hacker at any time, supporting the extensible source IP validation library and location mechanism; moreover, it will make some analysis and prediction in visualization. If the LAN suffers a large scale terrible intrusion, the system will cut off the sub-network by a block-out algorithm.","Intrusion detection; IPv6; Network security","Data flow analysis; Internet; Local area networks; Network protocols; Security systems; Information security; Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6); Intrusion Detection System (IDS); Modules; Network security; Security of data"

The answer to this question depends on several factors, including the users and the applications that have accessed the data, the timing and the type of data modifications such as permissions or schema and so on. Many studies pertain to the technical feasibility of continuous auditing of databases, but do not consider the economic feasibility of such auditing. This paper helps fill this void in the literature. We examine certain strategies that have been suggested in the database auditing literature (see, e.g. [Orman, L.V., 2001. Database audit and control strategies. Information Technology and Management 2(1), 27-51]) with major and minor modifications. Orman studied the counting, periodic and hybrid auditing strategies with the objective of minimizing the number of errors introduced during database access. Unlike Orman whose focus is on assessing the number of errors entering into the system (technical feasibility), we focus on the long run operating cost of running database audit. We use results from regenerative stochastic processes to derive expressions for the long run average cost under the counting and periodic auditing strategies.

This fact is further exacerbated because they are often remotely controlled and managed through supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are vulnerable to such cyber intrusion. The myriad sources of risk to SCADA systems identified through hierarchical holographic modeling (HHM)serve as the impetus to the roadmap for quantifying the efficacy of risk management of interdependent SCADA systems presented in this paper. Central to this quantification metric is the deployment of the inoperability input-output model (IIM). This is a Leontief-based model that enables accounting for both the intra-and interconnectedness within each economic sector and infrastructure. At the core of the IIM is the notion of risk of inoperability, which describes a critical infrastructure's expected level of dysfunction. The input to the system is an initial perturbation triggered by an attack of terrorism, an accidental event, or a natural disaster. The outputs of the system are the resulting risks of inoperability of different infrastructures due to their connections to one another. These outputs are presented in two different metrics: (1) economic in-operability measured in dollars lost for each interdependent sector of the economy, and (2) functional inoperability measured in each sector's percentage of dysfunctionality. This model addresses the equilibrium state of the system in the event of an attack, provided that the interdependency matrix is known. The national interdependency database provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), US Department of Commerce, constitutes the core database for the IIM interdependency matrix. The national database consists of 483 sectors and the regional of 37 sectors. The metric used for quantifying the efficacy of risk management of interdependent SCADA systems builds on the economic losses generated by the IIM resulting from a cyber attack with and then without risk management, and considering as well the cost of risk management. A scenario of a cyber attack on telecommunications and electric power infrastructures is discussed, using national BEA data. The results are analyzed, followed by a summary and conclusions.","HHM; IIM; SCADA",""

It contains recommendations for how businesses can best view the role of security technologies within an information security program. Design/methodology/approach The findings in the paper are derived from the observations of the author in his role as an information security consultant working for businesses in numerous vertical markets over the period of the last several years. Findings The principle finding in the paper is that the market for information security technologies is becoming a commodity market. This change will create a shift in how businesses view security technologies, as they will begin to focus on achieving security capabilities at the lowest possible cost. The processes of commoditization will also force security vendors to find new ways of doing business. Practical implications The paper makes several recommendations for how businesses should evaluate, acquire, and use security technologies within their information security program. It also highlights business needs that the security industry is currently not fulfilling. Originality/value The ideas in this paper are entirely original.

One security solution is IPSec, which is a set of protocols that provides both data confidentiality and authenticity. Another concern is the last mile bandwidth limitation on many Internet connections. This problem can be mitigated by bandwidth conservation techniques such as Application Layer and Stealth Multicast (SMC). Combining IPSec and multicast techniques would be ideal, but is not possible due to the nature of encrypted data and the requirements of multicast messages. We present the concept of a Trusted Security Device (TSD) which provides efficient bandwidth usage while maintaining security levels offered by IPSec. A TSD cooperates with clients and servers while implementing SMC technology. Minor modifications to clients and servers are necessary to enable discovery, key exchange, and communication between clients, servers, and TSDs.

The paper proposes a private key agreement based on the time-varying frequency characteristics suitable for OFDM. In the proposed method, the time-varying frequency characteristics are alternately measured on the basis of the channel reciprocity and generation of the key and key agreement is attempted. Also, in the proposed method, for prevention of errors in key generation, measurement time difference compensation of the channel, noise reduction by the synchronous addition process, and key disagreement correction by an algebraic decoding method are applied. Further, in order to evaluate the safety of the key, a method for evaluation of independence of the key is discussed. As a system mode for evaluation of the performance of the proposed method, a model is constructed for study that is based on the specification of the IEEE802.11a wireless LAN using the OFDM, so that verification of an operation can be carried out in a more realistic environment. Numerical simulation indicates that it is possible to share the private key in a realistic setting with an SN ratio of 15 dB by means of various measures for prevention of key disagreement.

The individual blocks will be scrambled with a random number into code-strings which will be concatenated into rows and columns code-streams. Finally, these code-streams will be applied to the MD5 and RSA algorithms to generate encrypted signed messages that will be hidden in the blocks.

It also discusses fundamental issues which affect the usability of DHMIS to support District Health System (DHS), including meeting user needs and user education in the use of information for management; and the need for integration of data from all health-providing and related organizations in the district. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in three DHSs in Kenya. Data was collected through use of questionnaires, focus group discussions and review of relevant literature, reports and operational manuals of the studied DHMISs. Results: Key personnel at the DHS level were not involved in the development and implementation of the established systems. The DHMISs were fragmented to the extent that their information products were bypassing the very levels they were created to serve. None of the DHMISs was computerized. Key resources for DHMIS operation were inadequate. The adequacy of personnel was 47%, working space 40%, storage space 34%, stationery 20%, 73% of DHMIS staff were not trained, management support was 13%. Information produced was 30% accurate, 19% complete, 26% timely, 72% relevant; the level of confidentiality and use of information at the point of collection stood at 32% and 22% respectively and information security at 48%. Basic DHMIS equipment for information processing was not available. This inhibited effective and efficient provision of information services. Conclusions: An effective DHMIS is essential for DHS planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation activities. Without accurate, timely, relevant and complete information the existing information systems are not capable of facilitating the DHS managers in their day-today operational management. The existing DHMISs were found not supportive of the DHS managers' strategic and operational management functions. Consequently DHMISs were found to be plagued by numerous designs, operational, resources and managerial problems. There is an urgent need to explore the possibilities of computerizing the existing manual systems to take advantage of the potential uses of microcomputers for DHMIS operations within the DHS. Information system designers must also address issues of cooperative partnership in information activities, systems compatibility and sustainability. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

But because full specification of Internet Key Exchange protocol introduced in RFC standards is so complex and heavy, it is not suitable for embedded system that has small resources. In this paper, we introduce the simplified Internet Key Exchange protocol for embedded system by supporting minimal function for co-working with other implementation.

Without both decoding masks, the encrypted information presented on a display cannot be decoded. We have developed a set of encryption codes so that information of a secret image can be shared among two decoding masks and a displayed image. The pixel arrangements of the decoding masks and the displayed image are designed to provide two limited viewing zones.

Whether health research be in genetics, new drugs, disease outbreaks, biochemistry, or effects of radiation, it deals with information that is highly sensitive and which could be targeted by rogue individuals or groups, corporations, national intelligence agencies, or terrorists, looking for financial, social, or political gains. The advents of the Internet and advances in recent information technologies have also dramatically increased opportunities for attackers to exploit sensitive and valuable information. Government agencies have deployed legislative measures to protect the privacy of health information and developed information security guidelines for epidemiological studies. However, risks are grossly underestimated and little effort has been made to strategically and comprehensively protect health research information by institutions, governments and international communities. There is a need to enforce a set of proactive measures to protect health research information locally and globally. Such measures should be deployed at all levels but will be successful only if research communities collaborate actively, governments enforce appropriate legislative measures at national level, and the international community develops quality standards, concluding treaties if necessary, at the global level. Proactive measures for the best information security and assurance would be achieved through rigorous management process with a cycle of “plan, do, check, and act”. Each health research entity, such as hospitals, universities, institutions, or laboratories, should implement this cycle and establish an authoritative security and assurance organization, program and plan coordinated by a designatedChief Security Officer who will ensure implementation of the above process, putting appropriate security controls in place, with key focus areas such aspolicies and best practices, enforcement and certification, risk assessment and audit, monitoring and incident response, awareness and training, and modern protection method and architecture.

Traditionally, a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) acts as an infomediary between benign identifiers (who voluntarily report vulnerability information) and software users. After verifying a reported vulnerability, CERT sends out a public advisory so that users can safeguard their systems against potential exploits. Lately, firms such as iDefense have been implementing a new market-based approach for vulnerability information. The market-based infomediary provides monetary rewards to identifiers for each vulnerability reported. The infomediary then shares this information with its client base. Using this information, clients protect themselves against potential attacks that exploit those specific vulnerabilities. The key question addressed in our paper is whether movement toward such a market-based mechanism for vulnerability disclosure leads to a better social outcome. Our analysis demonstrates that an active unregulated market-based mechanism for vulnerabilities almost always underperforms a passive CERT-type mechanism. This counterintuitive result is attributed to the market-based infomediary's incentive to leak the vulnerability information inappropriately. If a profit-maximizing firm is not allowed to (or chooses not to) leak vulnerability information, we find that social welfare improves. Even a regulated market-based mechanism performs better than a CERT-type one, but only under certain conditions. Finally, we extend our analysis and show that a proposed mechanism-federally funded social planner-always performs better than a market-based mechanism. © 2005 INFORMS.","Game theory; Information security; Public policy; Software vulnerabilities; Vulnerability disclosure","Competition; Game theory; Information analysis; Marketing; Public policy; Security of data; Social aspects; Social outcomes; Social planners; Software vulnerabilities; Vulnerability disclosure; Computer software"

In addition, the paper develops a process for ensuring that the best biometric applications are chosen, considering both the technology and related business issues. Findings The paper suggests that biometrics must be carefully selected to achieve a good fit to the security problem, giving examples of how a good fit might be evaluated by the user. The one-time and recurring charges associated with the typical biometric implementation are evaluated, arguing that these costs must be offset by a formal risk evaluation. The paper presents a user's guide for sensible implementation evaluations. Finally, the paper emphasizes that the use of biometrics in systems security implementations is one tool among many, and must thus be viewed as only part of an overall information security management infrastructure.

Signet is a tool used to store and manage authorization data across an enterprise or virtual organization. Grouper is a tool used to create and manage group information used in a wide variety of information system contexts. These tools emerged out of middleware initiatives funded by the National Science Foundation and Internet2 to solve problems common in inter-institutional application environments. Middleware initiatives seek to enable organizations that need to exchange information including higher education, scholarly information service providers, medical research and health care institutions, digital content providers, federal agencies and others that interact in higher education and medical environments.

Most visual cryptographic methods utilize the technique of pixel expansion, which causes the size of the shares to be much larger than that of the secret image. This situation is more serious for grey-level and chromatic images. In this paper, we propose a multi-pixel encoding method for grey-level and chromatic images without pixel expansion. We simultaneously encrypt r successive white or black pixels each time. The probability of these r pixels being coloured black depends on the ratio of blacks in the basis matrices. Afterward, we incorporate the techniques of colour decomposition and halftoning into the proposed scheme to handle grey-level and chromatic images. The experimental results show that the shares are not only the same size as the secret image, but also attain the requirement of security. The stacked images have good visual effect as well. Besides, our method can be easily extended to general access structure.

Whether health research be in genetics, new drugs, disease outbreaks, biochemistry, or effects of radiation, it deals with information that is highly sensitive and which could be targeted by rogue individuals or groups, corporations, national intelligence agencies, or terrorists, looking for financial, social, or political gains. The advents of the Internet and advances in recent information technologies have also dramatically increased opportunities for attackers to exploit sensitive and valuable information. Government agencies have deployed legislative measures to protect the privacy of health information and developed information security guidelines for epidemiological studies. However, risks are grossly underestimated and little effort has been made to strategically and comprehensively protect health research information by institutions, governments and international communities. There is a need to enforce a set of proactive measures to protect health research information locally and globally. Such measures should be deployed at all levels but will be successful only if research communities collaborate actively, governments enforce appropriate legislative measures at national level, and the international community develops quality standards, concluding treaties if necessary, at the global level. Proactive measures for the best information security and assurance would be achieved through rigorous management process with a cycle of ""plan, do, check, and act"". Each health research entity, such as hospitals, universities, institutions, or laboratories, should implement this cycle and establish an authoritative security and assurance organization, program and plan coordinated by a designated Chief Security Officer who will ensure implementation of the above process, putting appropriate security controls in place, with key focus areas such as policies and best practices, enforcement and certification, risk assessment and audit, monitoring and incident response, awareness and training, and modern protection method and architecture. Governments should enforce a comprehensive scheme, and international health research communities should adopt standardized innovative methods and approaches.","CSO/CISO; Health research information; ISMS; Proactive measures; Security and assurance","new drug; architecture; authority; awareness; certification; community; epidemic; financial management; genetics; government; health care organization; health care planning; health care policy; health care quality; health education; health program; hospital; human; incidence; intelligence; Internet; laboratory; law; medical audit; medical information; medical practice; medical research; medical technology; monitoring; practice guideline; privacy; protection; review; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; social security; standard; standardization; terrorism; university"

They claimed that the proposed schemes are efficient in the terms of communication overheads and computational efforts due to the following reasons: (i) The signed message is unnecessary to transmit, since verifiers can recover it from the proxy signature. (ii) The tasks of verifying the authenticity of public keys, validating the proxy signature, and recovering the signed message are carried out simultaneously in a single step. (iii) No certificates are required for validating the public keys. In this paper, we show that the proposed schemes are not secure. A malicious signer can cheat the certificate authority CA into extracting a proxy signature key without the permission of the original signer. Meanwhile, a malicious original signer can also cheat the certificate authority CA into extracting a proxy signature key without the permission of the proxy signer.

The proposed ECCSCPKC is constructed based on the elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC) and the ID-based self-certified public key cryptosystems. The approaches proposed in this paper possess the following advantages: When verifying the validity of public key, it does not need to spend extra much time to verify the signature in the digital certificate used in the certificate-based public key cryptosystem.Both distributing a session key and verifying the validity of public key can be concurrently achieved in a logically single step.Verifying both a signature and the validity of public key can be concurrently accomplished in a logically single step.Both decrypting a cipher correctly and verifying the validity of public key can be concurrently finished in a logically single step.Since the proposed methods are combined with the ID-based and ECC public key cryptosystems, they can reduce the computation cost greatly. In summary, based on the above characteristics, the proposed ECCSCPKC and its related security schemes can gain much efficiency in saving both the communicational cost and the computational effort, because they can simplify public key distribution. Also, since the proposed ECCSCPKC does not need to manage the key directory, the cost of system maintenance can be greatly reduced. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Although the one-way hash functions and encryption algorithms are applied to prevent the passwords from being disclosed, the password table or verification table is still vulnerable.

This is a technology known as dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM). Because of the huge amount of information per fiber, information security from bad actors such as eavesdroppers and network attackers has become a concern. Traditionally, communications security has been limited to network access and network administration, whereas data security is left to end clients where text is encrypted and decrypted. In the last decade, there has been a rapid increase in bandwidth demand mainly due to the explosion of the Internet and mobile telephony. The explosive bandwidth has been easily addressed with DWDM optical networks. However, data rate exceeding 1 Tbps within a fiber implies that there are tributaries carrying sensitive and proprietary data that are attractive to bad actors. Although data are encrypted by the end user, there is no assurance that, if captured by an eavesdropper, they may not be decrypted. Therefore, three new requirements emerge; monitor the optical link integrity, detect if an optical channel is compromised by tapping the fiber, and adopt a countermeasure strategy. However, in order to accomplish this, the channel performance needs to be monitored in real-time; alternatively, the channel signature as seen by the receiver needs to be known, and any changes need to be monitored. In this paper, we analyze the impairing factors of the transported optical channel due to non-linear behavior of the transmitting medium and due to the photon-matter interaction; these factors affect the performance parameters of the optical channel, such as bit error rate, signal to noise ratio, Q-factor, power level and more, in a unique way. Thus, the performance parameters in steady state constitute the channel signature. Clearly, parameter variations will affect thr channel signature. We continue with a statistical estimation analysis of the performance parameters of the optical channel, and for all practical purposes, of the channel signature. Monitoring in real time the performance parameters of a channel, it is equivalent to monitoring the channel signature. Moreover, we develop a method to estimate in real-time the channel signature, and how this can be employed to detect channel intrusion. Finally, we develop a countermeasure method and a protocol that we believe outsmarts the eavesdropper or the attacker.","Communications security; Optical channel signature; Optical networks security","Communication channels (information theory); Cryptography; Data communication systems; Dense wavelength division multiplexing; Fiber optic networks; Network protocols; Nonlinear optics; Optical links; Security of data; Signal detection; Communications security; Nonlinear behavior; Optical channel signature; Optical networks security; Optical communication"

We examine the development of transactive memory in crossorganizational networks-or ego-centric networks-that individuals build and maintain in their work. How do individuals develop transactive memory about who knows what in personally driven social networks that operate at the boundaries of cross-organizational work? In this paper, we advance a model of factors affecting the development of an individual's transactive memory of his/her ego-centric work network and test the model with a group of professionals engaged in responding to unforeseen events related to national security. Overall, we find that frequent use of dialogic practices explain much of the degree to which an individual has developed a transactive memory of his/her ego-centric network. Dialogic practices are, in turn, affected by the degree to which the task is perceived as interdependent on the knowledge and actions of others and organizational support for learning. We note theoretical extensions to the literatures of transactive memory and information systems design for ego-centric networks.","","Knowledge management; Cognitive structures; Cyber security; Knowledge-sharing; National security; Organizational support; Social Networks; Transactive memory; Information systems"

Electromagnetic (EM) disruption and EM DoS attacks are a specialised subset of threats to Information security. EM disruptors exploit the fact that electrical and electronic systems which comprise the basis of modern information infrastructures are susceptible to Radio Frequency (RF) or EM energy. EM disruptors are likely to have a large impact on the availability of information systems and supporting electronics but the effectiveness of the disruption and therefore the risk posed is extremely difficult to quantify. Nonetheless, 'Low Tech' means to develop disruptor sources exist and this may suit a hacker or even terrorist mentality. Whilst effective countermeasures for EM disruption exist, it is difficult to recommend their installation for risk mitigation, since the risk is poorly understood or quantified. Means of detecting EM disruption are not widely discussed in the open literature, and therefore do not appear to be widely developed. Development of EM detectors similar in many ways to conventional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) may be a useful step towards a greater understanding of the risk to information security posed by EM disruption. This paper discusses EM disruptor sources, the manifestation of EM susceptibility, and explores the requirements for an EM detection system.","Electromagnetic security; Intentional emi; Intrusion detection systems; Susceptibility","Computer crime; Information systems; Magnetic susceptibility; Personal computing; Security of data; Denial of service attacks; Detection system; DoS attacks; Electromagnetic security; Electronic systems; Information infrastructures; Intentional EMI; Intrusion Detection Systems; Physical security; Radio frequencies; Risk mitigation; Safety critical applications; Electromagnetism"

This need for realistic training for all combatants has been recognized and proven by the warfighter and continues to guide military training. However, to date, this key training principle has not been applied fully in the arena of cyberwarfare due to the lack of realistic, cost effective, reasonable, and formidable cyberwarfare opponents. Recent technological advances, improvements in the capability of computer-generated forces (CGFs) to emulate human behavior, and current results in research in information assurance and software protection, coupled with increasing dependence upon information superiority, indicate that the cyberbattlespace will be a key aspect of future conflict and that it is time to address the cyberwarfare training shortfall. To address the need for a cyberwarfare training and defensive testing capability, we propose research and development to yield a prototype computerized, semi-autonomous (SAF) red team capability. We term this capability the Cyber Warfare Opposing Force (CW OPFOR). There are several technologies that are now mature enough to enable, for the first time, the development of this powerful, effective, high fidelity CW OPFOR. These include improved knowledge about cyberwarfare attack and defense, improved techniques for assembling CGFs, improved techniques for capturing and expressing knowledge, software technologies that permit effective rapid prototyping to be effectively used on large projects, and the capability for effective hybrid reasoning systems. Our development approach for the CW OPFOR lays out several phases in order to address these requirements in an orderly manner and to enable us to test the capabilities of the CW OPFOR and exploit them as they are developed. We have completed the first phase of the research project, which consisted of developing an understanding of the cyberwarfare environment and categorizing offensive cyberwarfare strategies and techniques. In the second phase of the research project, which is the centerpiece of this paper, we developed and refined the system software architecture and system design and developed and revised a knowledge base design. In the third phase, which will be the subject of future research reports, we will implement a prototype CW OPFOR and test and evaluate its performance within realistic experiments. The second phase of the CW OPFOR research project is a key step; one that will determine the scalability, utility, and maintainability of the CWOPFOR. For the CW OPFOR, software development and knowledge acquisition must be key activities and must be conducted so that the CW OPFOR has the ability to adapt and incorporate research results and cyberbattlespace insights. This paper will discuss the key aspects of these two parallel knowledge base design efforts as well as discuss the CW OPFOR software architecture and design. The paper is organized as follows. Section One presents a discussion concerning the motivation for the CW OPFOR project, the need for the capability, and the expected results. Section Two contains a discussion of background material. Section Three contains an overview discussion of the CW OPFOR knowledge base design and the key design choices and alternatives considered at each choice. Section Four contains a discussion of conclusions and future work.","Computer generated actors; Cyberwarfare training; Hybrid reasoning systems; Software attack testing; Software security; Unified modeling language","Computer crime; Computer software; Error analysis; Personnel training; Security of data; Software prototyping; Computer generated actors; Cyberwarfare training; Hybrid reasoning systems; Iunified modeling language; Software attack testing; Software security; Software engineering"

Expected benefits from LAS investments include improvements in supply chain integration and streamlined operations. However, LAS may introduce a number of new information security vulnerabilities into organizations that must be carefully considered. LAS are highly decentralized and mobile, yet must connect to existing transactional systems to function. Decentralized, mobile applications are especially difficult to secure, and connections between LAS and internal applications can put those systems at risk too. The additional complexity of overall systems architectures also makes identifying security risks more challenging. We assert that current guidelines for information security are increasingly insufficient for organizations with highly decentralized systems and that more attention to how systems are employed is needed. We demonstrate this point with logical process models that illustrate how two different uses of one LAS technology result in different information security risks.","Location aware systems; RFID; Security","Information systems; Risk assessment; Security of data; Supply chains; Decentralized system; Declining costs; Department of Defense; Location aware system; Logical process; Mobile applications; Security; Security risk assessments; Security risks; Security vulnerabilities; Supply-chain integration; Systems architecture; Technological improvements; Transactional systems; Walmart; Radio frequency identification (RFID)"

In practice, such evaluations are labour-intensive and costly, so there is a strong incentive to find ways to make the process more efficient. In this paper we show how well-known concepts from graph theory can be applied to a device's design to optimise information security evaluations. In particular, we use end-to-end graph traversals to eliminate components that do not need to be evaluated at all, and minimal cutsets to identify the smallest group of components that needs to be evaluated in depth.

Digital convergence is introducing more diverse services to the world of digital television. The return channel, which enables interactive television, is key to this development and may be considered the most vulnerable element of the terminal device in terms of information security. Accordingly, its protection from threats brought about by Internet use, such as malicious programs, is of the essence. The special characteristics of digital convergence - value networks and the secure linking of different infrastructures - need to be taken into consideration in service development processes. Special emphasis in this report is given to Multimedia Home Platform (MHP), as alongside the return channel it is one of the most important technologies enabling interactive television. The information security threats related to it are examined from the viewpoint of the service developer. MHP information security solutions are discussed and their maturity and suitability assessed with regard e.g. to signature practices currently being developed.

User authentication is a foundation procedure in the overall pursuit of these objectives, and password procedures historically have been the primary method of user authentication. There is an inverse relationship between the level of security provided by a password procedure and ease of recall for users. The longer the password and the more variability in its characters, the higher the level of security is that is provided by the password, because it is more difficult to violate or crack. However, such a password tends to be more difficult for an end user to remember, particularly when the password does not spell a recognizable word or when it includes non-alphanumeric characters such as punctuation marks or other symbols. Conversely, when end users select their own more easily remembered passwords, the passwords also may be cracked more easily. This study presents a new approach to entering passwords that combines a high level of security with easy recall for the end user. The Check-Off Password System (COPS) is more secure than self-selected passwords and high-protection, assigned-password procedures. The present study investigates tradeoffs between using COPS and three traditional password procedures, and provides a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of COPS. The study offers evidence that COPS is a valid alternative to current user authentication systems. End users perceive all tested password procedures to have equal usefulness, but the perceived ease of use of COPS passwords equals that of an established high-security password, and the new interface does not negatively affect user performance compared to a high-security password. Further research will be conducted to investigate long-term benefits. © 2005, Idea Group Inc.","",""

Software development is part science, part art, and part craft. Design, architecture, and coding are equally important activities and in each of these activities, errors may be introduced that lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, inevitably, errors enter into the code. Some of these errors are discovered during testing; however, some are not. The best way to find security errors, whether they are introduced as part of the architecture development effort or coding effort, is to automate the security testing process to the maximum extent possible and add this class of tools to the tools available, which aids in the compilation process, testing, test analysis, and software distribution. Recent technological advances, improvements in computer-generated forces (CGFs), and results in research in information assurance and software protection indicate that we can build a semi-intelligent software security testing tool. However, before we can undertake the security testing automation effort, we must understand the scope of the required testing, the security failures that need to be uncovered during testing, and the characteristics of the failures. Therefore, we undertook the research reported in the paper, which is the development of a taxonomy and a discussion of software attacks generated from the point of view of the security tester with the goal of using the taxonomy to guide the development of the knowledge base for the automated security testing tool. The representation for attacks and threat cases yielded by this research captures the strategies, tactics, and other considerations that come into play during the planning and execution of attacks upon application software. The paper is organized as follows. Section one contains an introduction to our research and a discussion of the motivation for our work. Section two contains a presents our taxonomy of software attacks and a discussion of the strategies employed and general weaknesses exploited for each attack. Section three contains a summary and suggestions for further research.","Cyberattack modeling; Information assurance; Simulation; Software security","Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Computer software; Encoding (symbols); Error analysis; Program compilers; Security of data; Cyberattack modeling; Information assurance; Software coding; Software security; Software engineering"

Cryptography is a milliner science that was the key to the secret of ancient Rome and a fundamental piece in the Second World War. Today, it is a star in the computation world. Several operating systems, data base systems or simple filling systems provide the user with cryptographic functions that allow controlled data scrambling. Modern cryptology, which is the basis of information security techniques, started in the late 1970's and developed in the 1980's. As communication networks were spreading deep into society, the need for secure communication greatly promoted cryptographic research. The need for fast but secure cryptographic systems is growing bigger. Therefore, dedicated hardware for cryptography is becoming a key issue for designers. With the spread of reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs, hardware implementations of cryptographic algorithms became cost-effective. The focus of this book is on all aspects of cryptographic hardware and embedded systems. This includes design, implementation and security of such systems.

Most of the banks have already developed sophisticated risk management frameworks helping to quantify and manage operational risk. Information security has direct impact on operational risk, but risk managers consider Information Systems (IS) related risks not enough by now. This problem mainly depends on the variety of methods used by security managers to evaluate systems security and to develop security concepts. Even little efforts would enable information security officers to quantify the benefits of information security investments using operational risk quantification methods. The security community has not yet addressed this opportunity. The article discusses models used for decisions about security investments known from the field of security economics and accounting and illustrates the problems by applying these models. Based on a general operational risk management framework of a bank, this article introduces a new approach using accepted risk management methods.","Investments; IT security; Return on security investment; Risk analysis","Information systems; Investments; Managers; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security of data; Security systems; Basel capital accord; Basel II; Direct impact; Financial industry; Financial institution; Information security investment; IT security; Management method; Operational risks; Related risk; Risk management framework; Risk manager; Security community; Security Economics; Security investments; Security manager; Systems security; Economics"

Both of these approaches have significant implications when a security breach occurs. One, the interconnections may become conduits for security breach propagation. Two, shared information assets now become vulnerable at the owner as well as at the partner firms' sites. Therefore, an effective security investment strategy in a supply chain must take into account vulnerability issues arising out of propagation of security breaches and sharing of information assets. Investments in perimeter security technologies reduce direct vulnerability of information assets, but are ineffective in countering indirect breaches, which originate from partnering firms. Our research investigates interdependent security investment strategies of supply chain firms in a game-theoretic framework, and analyze non-cooperative and centrally administered investment equilibria.

Such decisions involve tradeoffs between system protection resources and system recovery resources as alternative means for reducing uncertainty. Information security settings that involve information warfare and business continuity planning (disaster recovery) fundamentally change the parameters that influence these tradeoff decisions. In such settings, system managers must prepare for the possibility of an improbable event. Such events involve ""normal compromises"", compromises that arise intentionally or accidentally as unplanned and unpredictable system processes. The logical basis for decisions about normal compromises shifts from foundations in probability theory to foundations in possibility theory. By understanding this shift, security planners can better prepare for events of low probability, but crisp possibility, by recognizing that risk reduction will involve increased dependence on system recovery as a means for reducing uncertainty.","Business continuity planning; Information systems security; Information warfare; Possibility theory","Commerce; Security of data; Business continuity planning; Disaster recovery; Information systems security; Information warfare; Low probability; Possibility theory; Probability theory; Risk reductions; System process; System protection; System recovery; Recovery"

In this paper, we report on research that addresses this question: “How have changes over time in the frequency of hacking and other intentional forms of security threats affected the validity of information systems risk management taxonomies?” We replicate a simple study of the proportions of categories of security threats that was originally completed in 1993. Comparing the results from the replicated study with the results from the original study, we find that the proportions of threat categories have, in contradiction with the popular perception, remained relatively stable over the past decade. These results indicate that human error remains a significant and poorly recognized issue for information systems security.

It was concluded that central administration of security should be replaced by a model that distributes the responsibility for security to so-called information owners.

The prevention can be achieved through information flow control. Many information flow control models were developed, which may be based on discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC), label-based approach, and role-based access control (RBAC). Most existing models are for object-oriented systems. Since the procedural C language is still in use heavily, offering a model to control information flows for C applications should be fruitful. Although we identified information flow control models that can be applied to procedural languages, they do not offer the features we need. We thus developed a model to control information flows for C applications. Our model is based on access control lists (ACLs) and named CACL. It offers the following features: (a) controlling both read and write access, (b) preventing indirect information leakage, (c) detailing the control granularity to variables, (d) avoiding improper function call, (e) controlling function call through argument sensitivity, and (f) preventing change of an application when the access rights of the application's real world users change.

In these inherently unstable conditions and bearing in mind the resource's limitations that are attributed to participating devices, the deployment of Knowledge Management techniques is considered complicated due to the particular requirements. Security considerations are also very important since the distribution of knowledge information to multiple locations over a network, poses inherent problems and calls for advanced methods in order to mitigate node misbehaviour and in order to enforce authorized and authenticated access to this information. This paper addresses the issue of secure and distributed knowledge management applications in pervasive environments. We present a prototype implementation after having discussed detailed design principles as far as the communications and the application itself is regarded. Robustness and lightweight implementation are the cornerstones of the proposed solution. The approach we have undertaken makes use of overlay networks to achieve efficiency and performance optimization, exploiting ontologies.

One of them is requirement of assurance of the information security when it is transmitted, transformed, and stored in the electronic service. It is possible to provide an appropriate level of security applying the present-day in-formation technology. However, the level of the protection of information is of-ten much higher than it is necessary to meet potential threats. Since the level of security strongly affects the performance of whole system, the excessive protection decreases the system's reliability and availability and, as a result, its global security.

The same can be said for questions of privacy. This chapter starts by showing how and why information assurance and privacy can become problems worthy of ethical consideration. It demonstrates that there is no simple and linear relationship between ethics and information assurance or between ethics and privacy. Many decisions in the area of IT, however, affect not only one, but both of these subjects. The ethical evaluation of decisions and actions in the area of privacy and security, therefore, is highly complex. This chapter explores the question whether individual responsibility is a useful construct to address ethical issues of this complexity. After introducing a theory of responsibility, this chapter discusses the conditions that a subject of responsibility typically is assumed to fulfill. This chapter will argue that individual human beings lack some of the essential preconditions necessary to be ascribed responsibility. Individuals have neither the power, the knowledge, nor the intellectual capacities to deal successfully with the ethical challenges in the tension of privacy and information assurance. This chapter ends by suggesting that the concept of responsibility, nevertheless, may be useful in this setting, but it would have to be expanded to allow collective entities as subjects. © 2005, Idea Group Inc.","",""

In this context IT risk management (ITRM) has become an important organizational function to control internal and external risks associated with IT. Much effort has been put on mitigating IT risks by means of physical, procedural, and technological solutions. However, the socio-cultural perspective of managing these risks has largely been ignored and thus a ""cultural gap"" in ITRM can be identified. This paper introduces risk culture as an essential component of an integrated IT risk management and presents a theoretically motivated framework for analyzing the construct risk culture. Based on this framework we conducted a case study that underpins the crucial role of a vital risk culture in an organization. From the empirical findings we derived important factors for establishing risk culture such as (among others) communication campaigns or top-management involvement.","Information security; Information security culture; IT risk management; Risk culture; Security awareness","Information systems; Personal computing; Security of data; Empirical findings; Essential component; Malwares; Organizational functions; Security awareness; Security incident; Success factors; Technical aspects; Technological solution; Risk management"

A good security risk management offers a positive guarantee for hospitals, which highly relying on information technology, while running their organization. While carrying out risk analysis, the value of information assets, existing weakness, and potential threat from outside of this information system must be realized. It is quite important to determine the value of information assets for the security risk management. With information age coming, there is the greater part of asset value not shown from the traditional balance sheets in accounting books. This kind of asset, which can't be shown on the balance sheet, is intellectual capital. In the study of information asset and intellectual capital, Ross et al. (1996) divided information assets into three kinds of capitals-human asset, technology asset and relationship asset. These play the same tune with the three key elements of intellectual capitals-human capital, structural capital and relational capital. Within numerous assessment methods of intellectual capital, balanced scorecard assesses intellectual capital value from the view of management and efficiency. Hence, this research proposes utilizing the balanced scorecard to find out the assessment index of information assets for domestic medical institutes while carrying on risk management.

These include traditional 'tunnels and bridges' that bypass the firewalled corporate perimeter, such as visitor's laptops, VPN tunnels, encrypted & zipped email attachments, unencrypted wireless, and weak authentication. A potential threat that has not been widely documented is embedded Windows ™ based systems and appliances. Corporate networks that are otherwise highly secure often have some tens of nodes that are not generally recognized as 'computers', however run networkable Windows ™ operating systems (OS). These devices range from smart phones to engineering microscopes, from oscilloscopes to print stations, and many others. They may have no single owner, and frequently generic or group user accounts are established on them. They have not been purchased by the IT department and may not appear on IT's lists of machines to patch and monitor. Vendor's practices vary widely, with results for their customers ranging from 'no issue' to 'serious risk'. This paper narrates the embedded appliance infosecurity lifecycle, to provide vendors of such systems with best-in-class precautionary measures they should take on behalf of their customers' security, and to provide purchasers of such appliances with a checklist to enable them to select secure products. LeCroy, a leader in safe and secure Windows ™ appliance engineering, provides the reference case for best-in-class practice.

One of the key problems facing the computer industry today involves ensuring the integrity of end-user applications and data. One way to consider the security problem is the unauthorized execution of code on a particular system. Researchers in the relatively new field of software protection investigate the development and evaluation of controls that prevent unauthorized modification or use of system software. While many previously developed protection schemes have provided a strong level of security, their overall effectiveness has been hindered by a lack of transparency to the user in terms of performance overhead. Other approaches are on the opposite extreme and sacrifice security for the sake of this need for transparency. In this talk, the speaker will present an architecture for software protection that provides both security and user transparency by utilizing the concepts of multiple programmable cores on modern processors. The usage of additional resources dynamically enhance security and protection using the co-processing paradigm. Initial results show how the use of FPGAs as co-processors can accelerate execution of programs in a cryptographic environment, while maintaining the flexibility through reprogramming to carry out any compiler-driven protections that may be application-specific. Finally, the speaker describes some of the specific problems such as untrusted foundry, multi-level separation, etc. that is being addressed using the overall approach.","","Computer programming; Computer software; Information analysis; Problem solving; Multiple programmable cores; Software protection; Security of data"

Unfortunately, the Internet has also become an arena where individuals are constantly at risk for computer viruses, spyware/adware infection, and malicious attacks designed to misuse or appropriate corporate assets. The wide-spread publicity of both cyber-attacks and ways to combat these problems, public and corporate education efforts, and prevention efforts (including corporate spending on new protections and enforcement of existing policies), suggest that it is logical for users to put precautionary practices in place. Unfortunately, they often don't. Many individuals within organizations underestimate their vulnerability and do not follow prescribed security policies and procedures implemented within their organizations. Extant security literature heavily emphasizes automatic or programmed security measures, but does not focus strongly on the behaviors of individuals in the security setting. This paper examines two research questions: What are the effects of organizational policies and procedures on security precautions taken by individuals? What is the role that individual risk perceptions play in individual cyberprecautions choices? These questions will be addressed by theory taken from the formal control and fear of crime literatures. This theory posits that formal controls and individuals' experiences have a strong effect on both individual perceptions of mandatory rules and individual risk perceptions. These perceptions, in turn, lead to precaution-taking behaviors. The resulting model will be tested with a field survey.","","Computer viruses; Information systems; Internet; Risk perception; Cyber-attacks; Field surveys; Formal controls; Malicious attack; Organizational policies; Research questions; Security measure; Security policy; Security settings; Spy-ware; Network security"

While not sidestepping the theory, the emphasis is on developing the skills and knowledge that security and information technology students and professionals need to face their challenges. The book is organized around four major themes: Cryptography: classic cryptosystems, symmetric key cryptography, public key cryptography, hash functions, random numbers, information hiding, and cryptanalysis. Access control: authentication and authorization, password-based security, ACLs and capabilities, multilevel and multilateral security, covert channels and inference control, BLP and Biba's models, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems. Protocols: simple authentication protocols, session keys, perfect forward secrecy, timestamps, SSL, IPSec, Kerberos, and GSM. Software: flaws and malware, buffer overflows, viruses and worms, software reverse engineering, digital rights management, secure software development, and operating systems security. Additional features include numerous figures and tables to illustrate and clarify complex topics, as well as problems-ranging from basic to challenging-to help readers apply their newly developed skills. A solutions manual and a set of classroom-tested PowerPoint(r) slides will assist instructors in their course development.

The correctness issue becomes more important in Information Assurance applications where a protocol is designed to deal with hostile and unpredictable behavior of the processes and/or the network. The purpose of this paper is to provide a simulation-based methodology to validate the correctness of a candidate protocol. The methodology is based on state-machine modeling of the protocol in a context of its application-level goal and operating environment. The paper offers a 3-tier approach, wherein a validation model captures the external constraints to be satisfied at the protocol interface, the environment perturbations the protocol is subjected to, and the protocol internal rules and procedures. Discrete-event simulators, developed in a suitable modeling language (such as PROMELA), check if a protocol meets the safety and liveness conditions prescribed at external interface to the protocol under a given operating environment. The modularity and designer-friendliness of our validation approach allow simulating different candidate protocols with ease and flexibility. The paper illustrates our methodology with validation exercises on an alternating-bit data transfer protocol and a 2-phase commit based majority voting protocol.","","Computer simulation; Data transfer; Information theory; Interfaces (computer); Mathematical models; Network protocols; Perturbation techniques; Candidate protocol; Modeling language; Operating environment; Simulation-based validation; Distributed computer systems"

Research methods employed include interviews with enterprises, literature searches, expert opinions and extensive rounds of commentary. The fact that information security threats also concern mobile services and should be given serious consideration is the most important finding of the study. However, this does not mean information security issues would pose an obstacle to the development or introduction of mobile services. All information security issues need to be addressed at the very outset of the service development process. Methods and technological solutions that may also be utilized in mobile services have already been developed. Sets of instructions safeguarding e.g. the security of actions and processes are less readily available. The major information security threats facing developers of mobile services include the complexity of technological solutions, the illegal copying of content and programs, threats posed by the Internet, the different levels of various players in the service development process, and threats involving the identification of service users and servers and the confidentiality of information. Mobile services also involve other threats; however, since their significance to the service developer greatly depends on the nature of the service under development, it is difficult to assess the risks arising therefrom on a general level. The study describes alternative solutions to information security threats observed. Nevertheless, information security issues need to be examined individually for each service to be developed, as there are no universal solutions for information security. The service development process is addressed separately in the study and the significance of information security is expanded upon at each stage of the process from idea generation to service termination.

INFOSEC (information security) alert correlation systems provide a natural home for such capabilities. It can be asked whether the current generation of these systems has the technical capabilities required to enact optimal tactical responses. Specifically, is there a requirement to incorporate deeper levels of risk analysis within correlation systems? Currently, correlation systems only model attack risk via the generic attack severity metrics. Hence, these systems implicitly assume that: (a) all attacks are uniquely identifiable, or (b) the risk associated with the attacks is uniformly distributed across the set of plausible attacks. This work provides formal support for the intuitive supposition that such assumptions may not be supportable in the real-world and, hence, that integrated risk modeling is likely a necessity if optimal tactical attack response sub-systems are to be added.","","Automation; Optimization; Risk analysis; Security of data; Alert correlation; Automated systems; Correlation system; Current generation; INFOSEC alerts; Integrated risks; Tactical response; Technical capabilities; Risk perception"

The I3A is introduced by discussing two examples of possible solutions that would use the concept in e-commerce. Findings - In essence, I3A offers an open platform for enabling I3A of cryptographic keys, certificates, and privileges and integrating the use of such with secured applications on a wide variety of devices and environments.

While there is extensive publicity on the increasing incidents of numerous information security breaches and their serious consequences, recent surveys and research on information security repeatedly identify the low levels of user and managerial awareness as a key obstacle to achieving a good information security posture. The main motivation of our research emanates from this contradicting phenomenon: increased vulnerability to information security breaches yet the low level of user and managerial awareness on information security threats. In this research, we study this dissonance by addressing a cognitive bias, optimistic bias, that is, the tendency of people to believe that negative events are less likely to happen to them than to others and that positive events are more likely to happen to them than others. Using a survey, we find that users demonstrate optimistic bias in their risk perceptions associated with information security. This self-serving bias is also found to be related to a perception of controllability with information security threats. These results have practical implications for designing security awareness programs by suggesting that risk communication and management efforts are likely to fail unless they consider this bias.","Awareness; Information security; Optimistic bias; Perceived controllability; Risk management; Risk perception","Information systems; Managers; Research; Risk management; Risk perception; Security systems; Surveys; Awareness; Cognitive bias; Information security threats; Low level; Management efforts; Networked business; Optimistic bias; Risk communication; Security awareness; Self-serving bias; Work environments; Security of data"

These properties are very useful for providing a secure negotiation over Internet. Accordingly, many interactive or non-interactive deniable authentication protocols have been proposed. However, the interactive manner makes deniable protocols inefficient. And, a security hole is generated in the deniable protocols using the non-interactive manner if a session secret is compromised. That is, there is no both secure and efficient deniable authentication protocol as of now. In this paper, a new protocol based on the non-interactive manner is proposed to efficiently and securely achieve deniable authentication. Furthermore, the proposed protocol is allowed to replace the underlying signature scheme to retain the security if the previously used signature method is broken.","Deniable authentication; Digital signature; Information security; Internet","Authentication; Cybernetics; Electronic document identification systems; Information science; Internet; Security of data; Deniable authentication; New protocol; Non-interactive deniable authentication protocols; Security holes; Signature Scheme; Third parties; Internet protocols"

In a recent speech, the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard put the importance of MDA in these terms, ""Global Maritime Domain Awareness will allow us to detect, surveill, identify, classify, and interdict vessels of interest. Global MDA gives us the cued intel that will provide the situational awareness and clarity necessary to determine if a vessel is friend or foe."" This challenge has been addressed by the United States Government in a number of policy documents, most importantly, the National Strategy for Maritime Security and The National Plan to Improve Maritime Domain Awareness. These documents highlight the importance of MDA both as a challenge and an opportunity. The importance of MDA to homeland defense was highlighted in a public statement by the Assistant Secretary of Defense of Homeland Security who noted, ""It seems to me that it is in the maritime domain that we have the greatest potential to substantially improve our homeland defense."" While the policy imperatives of achieving MDA are strong and straightforward and while the concept of operations to put this into effect is already evolving, the technical challenges to achieving the requisite degree of MDA to pursue the GWOT and defend the U.S. Homeland and the homeland territory of other nations are significant. President Bush put this in stark terms over three years ago when he noted, ""The heart of the Maritime Domain Awareness program is accurate information, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance of all vessels, cargo and people extending well beyond traditional maritime boundaries."" The technical community, particularly the Navy laboratory community, has moved forward to address this national issue. Based on experience with similar operational challenges, and as a member of the MDA Technology Working Group consortium working closely with the DHS and the USCG; Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego has been intimately involved in the process of identifying the functional requirements and the technical capabilities needed to achieve MDA. This paper discusses those functional requirements and technical capabilities. In order to deliver robust MDA, it is imperative to view the solution from the standpoint of ""What is it we need to accomplish for MDA?"" Those functional capabilities include focused sensing and data acquisition, dynamic interoperable connectivity, responsive information management, information assurance, consistent representation, distributed collaboration, and dynamic decision support. These core competencies to achieve MDA bound the technical trade space and enable both the policy and operational communities to understand the nature of the MDA challenge. Armed with these functional capabilities as a template to map technologies, candidate technical solutions to each part of the MDA challenge - ""What tools do we need to achieve MDA?"" -can be found. This paper identifies a group of candidate technologies that leverage the capabilities of the Department of Defense Global Information Grid and the U.S. Navy's FORCEnet to provide the operators with a robust capability to achieve MDA.","","Data acquisition; Decision support systems; Marine engineering; Robustness (control systems); Strategic planning; Operational communities; Robust capability; Technical community; Security systems"

However, this raises the question of how well small business manages its IT security and the threats that security lapses may pose to the wider trading network. It is in the interest of all members of an electronic trading network, as well as governments, to assist smaller companies to secure their business data. This paper considers the relationship between IT security management and IT policy implementation among small businesses involved in business-to-business eCommerce. It reports the results of a survey of 240 Australian small and medium businesses operating in a cross-industry environment. The survey found a low level of strategic integration of eCommerce along with inadequate IT security among the respondents, despite the fact that 81% were doing business online and 97% identified their business data as confidential. Businesses which implemented satisfactory levels of security technologies were more likely than others to have an information technology policy within the organisation.

Since fact finding and evaluation of facts are important aspects of ethical decision making, part of ethics education needs to be done within technical courses with the goal of complementing the philosophical foundations or generic applied ethics discussions left best to the general education curriculum. Teaching ethics well is hard. A basic problem - an instance of living in a post-modern world - is the lack of a common foundation to make ethical judgments. In addition, gaining and maintaining technical expertise is a full-time job that an instructor might not want to supplement by gaining expertise in the challenging fields of business or applied ethics; thus, any method for teaching ethics needs to be simple.A group of philosophers at the Markkula Center for Ethics at Santa Clara University developed a simple framework for business ethics that distills various philosophical approaches towards Ethics in simple questions. The resulting procedure consists in ""simply"" answering these questions and thereby approaching a difficult situation from various perspectives. While the framework cannot solve certain thorny issues, it is quite successful at elucidating ethical problems and - possibly more importantly - it gives those exposed to it a common language. In my opinion, this framework allows us to teach ethics in Information Assurance classes in a manner that (1) is not biased by the personal views of the instructor, that (2) does not involve a large sacrifice of class room time, that is (3) reasonably culturally and gender neutral, that (4) is quite successful helping elucidating new ethical issues and (5) that allows someone with a technical background but no or limited philosophical background to successfully teach ethics.

Computing environments implementing well managed patch management processes with quick response mechanisms will survive from most of serious attacks, such as MyDoom and Sasser Warm attacks in 2004. Medium or large enterprises usually have heterogeneous computing environments. For example, a company may use an Apache Server in a Linux-base PC as its Internet web server, use an IBM AIX running IBM DB2 database system as a database server, and equip all employees with Windows-based PCs running Microsoft Office for their daily work. Also, employees might work at many different locations. In the enterprise patch management (PM) market today, there are very few complete off-the-shelf solutions. A systematic efficient PM process model with complete patch management activity process cycle and patching strategies was proposed. We also propose an automatic five-layer PM system application architecture supporting heterogeneous environment. The model, hopefully, will make enterprise patch process more efficient, and will reduce the risks suffer from patch management challenges. © 2005 IEEE.","Information security; Network management; Patch management","Computer networks; Computer operating systems; Computer viruses; Information management; Security of data; Servers; Heterogeneous computing; Management problems; Network management; Patch management; Computer architecture"

However, Juang's scheme is potentially susceptible to the man-in-the-middle attack. On the other hand, the function of service period management can allow servers to update the list of illegal users easily and periodically.

The existing methods are typically experimental in nature highly dependent of the assessor's experience, and the security metrics are usually qualitative. We propose to address the dual problems of experimental analysis and qualitative metrics by developing two complementary approaches for security assessment: (1) analytical modeling, and (2) metrics-based assessment. To avoid experimental evaluation, we put forward a formal model that permits the accurate and scientific analysis of different security attributes and security flaws. To avoid qualitative metrics leading to ambiguous conclusions, we put forward a collection of mathematical formulas based on which quantitative metrics can be derived. The vulnerability analysis model responses to the need for a theoretical foundation for modeling information security, and security metrics are the cornerstone of risk analysis and security management. In addition to the security analysis approach, we discuss security testing methods as well. A Relative Complete Coverage (RCC) principle is proposed along with an example of applying the RCC principle. The innovative ideas proposed in this paper include a hierarchical multi-level modeling approach to modeling vulnerability using model composition and refinement techniques, a data-centric, quantitative metrics mechanism, and multidimensional assessment capturing both process and product elements in a formalized framework.

This paper describes information operations across their fundamental structure of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and suggests a separation between industrial espionage and legitimate business information gathering. A model for establishing information superiority is presented, outlining the importance of 'cradle-to-grave' implementation throughout the business lifecycle. This brings together key doctrinal points from the information security, information operations and information warfare fields.

The only solution to this growing problem is to build up internal protections, then work with industry peers and law enforcement to build a common defense. This paper analyzes the most common forms of online extortion, and the most effective responses to them.

The reciprocity in wave propagation is exploited to share the key with a party on the air. An array of electronically steered parasitic radiators provides time variation in the faded amplitude. This variation exhibits strong spatio-randomness which can never be practically solved by any other party.

System call monitoring has been touted as an effective defense against control hijacking attacks because it could prevent remote attackers from inflicting damage upon a victim system even if they can successfully compromise certain applications running on the system. However, the Achilles' heel of the system call monitoring approach is the construction of accurate system call behavior model that minimizes false positives and negatives. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Program semantics-Aware Intrusion Detection system called Paid, which automatically derives an application-specific system call behavior model from the application's source code, and checks the application's run-time system call pattern against this model to thwart any control hijacking attacks. Experiments on a fully working Paid prototype show that Paid can indeed stop attacks that exploit non-standard security holes, such as format string attacks that modify function pointers, and that the run-time latency and throughput penalty of Paid are under 11.66% and 10.44%, respectively, for a set of production-mode network server applications including Apache, Sendmail, Ftp daemon, etc.","","Computer crime; Electronic mail; Feature extraction; Mathematical models; Servers; Cybersecurity threats; Hijacking attacks; Intrusion Detection system; Run-time system; Security of data"

Because the way success of information security investments is measured compared to the way investments that the rest of the firm makes is different, it is difficult for a firm to decide how much to invest in information security. This paper proposes a way to measure information security investments potential by calculating how the investment affects the firm's level or risk averseness.

The networks are helping to transfer vital and often highly sensitive information while ordinary users are also connected to access network. Protecting the information of an enterprise is a must in the competitive world of information age. With the growing network size and complexity, their protection from threats has become increasingly difficult. The problem with network security solutions is that technology driven, non-integrated products such as firewalls and intrusion detectors provide only protection for specific type of threats. But the need for the organization today is comprehensive coverage of threats to their enterprise networks. Individual security products often lack inter-oper ability, scalability and ease of manageability. So a holistic security management and centralized control solution that integrates and manages the different security appliances is required for enterprise networks. This paper offers implementation of such solution for information security management. In any organization information assurance is very much important. It requires integrity of the network system with respect to security appliances of different varieties in the network. Information assurance also requires centralized log gathering and analysis for getting unified view, which will make monitoring and troubleshooting easier. Centralized log analysis helps in timely situation awareness with respect to organizational policy implementation. This will also help in easy classification of the policy violations caused either by the known source (administrators) or external malicious users, thus providing the information assurance to the organization.","Information assurance; Log analysis; Security framework","Computer viruses; Industrial management; Internet; Access networks; Centralized controls; Defense sectors; Enterprise IS; Enterprise networks; Highly sensitives; Information ages; Information assurance; Information centers; Information security managements; Integrated products; Intrusion detectors; Log analysis; Network security solutions; Network sizes; Network systems; Organizational policies; Security appliances; Security framework; Security managements; Security products; Situation awareness; Troubleshooting; Network security"

Various methods have been proposed to determine the effective level of security investment. In this paper, we introduce an extreme value approach to address the issues of effective budgeting and investing in IT security. In our model, the security status of a system depends on two factors: system security level, which is measured by the level of security investment, and system attack level, which reflects the security risk with which the system is confronted. Security investment level is endogenous to the system, while attack level is exogenous. Extreme value analysis is used to characterize the stochastic behavior of high-level attacks based on the historical data and to make inferences on future attacks. Based on these inferences, we determine the effective security solutions and the level of security investment to modulate the likelihood of system failure. For illustration purposes, we use an extreme value approach to analyze a set of traffic data collected from a regional bank.","Denial of service (DoS); Extreme value theory; Information assurance; Security investment; Two-factor model","Budget control; Information systems; Security of data; Denial of Service; Extreme value theory; Information assurance; Security investments; Two-factor models; Investments"

When multiple systems are updated by security patches for mitigating system vulnerability, configuration management based on system resource is trivial, in order to increase accuracy, efficiency and effectiveness of software processes. By employing XML technology, we can achieve seamless and efficient configuration management between heterogeneous system format as well as data formats in analysing and exchanging the pertinent information for information assurance vulnerability. Thus, when a system is updated to improve system vulnerability, the proposed XML-based configuration management mechanism refers to the system resource information and analyse the security model and posture of affected sustained system and minimize the propagated negative impact. Then, an executable architecture for implementation to verify the proposed scheme and algorithm and testing environment is presented to mitigate vulnerable systems for sustained system.","Configuration management; Information assurance; Resource-aware management; System engineering; Vulnerability; XML","Information systems; Management; Systems engineering; XML; Configuration management; Information assurance; Resource aware; System engineering; Vulnerability; Security of data"

The PKI provides a framework to verify the identity of each entity in a given domain. The PKI framework includes mechanisms of requesting, issuing, signing, and validating public-key certificates. The privilege management infrastructure (PMI) framework determines whether the entity is authorized to access specific resources. It includes the issuance and validation of attribute certificates. Public-key certificates are certificates for trusting public-key, while attribute certificates are certificates for trusting privilege attribute. In the practical cases, when the system identifies a user's identity, it allocates the right permissions to the resources to the user according to the roles he/she played. This permission control mechanism is called the role-based access control (RBAC).

The security of an electronic signature creation process is the crucial issue especially in distributed environment where the frameworks (forms) of finally signed documents are delivered by the entity other than the Signing Entity (SE). Usually, after the completion of such a form with the data specific for SE, the final acceptance is performed via the encryption of completed data hash value with SE's private key. It is important to ensure the conditions when the whole document, including the form (template) delivered by the Application Provider (AP), could be trusted. It is quite different situation than the case of standing alone Secure Signature Creation Device (SSCD) separated from telecommunication channels during the signing procedure. The trust assigned to various APs can be limited so the participation of the commonly accepted Trusted Party (TP) operating on-line can be the solution of that problem. The proposed cryptographic protocol is designed to fulfil the security requirements. It combines asymmetric and symmetric cryptographic means. SE after the completion of the form delivered by AP sends it back to AP for examination of formal correctness of the Data to Be Signed. The next steps of the protocol require the Signature Service Provider (SSP) confirmation of those data. That confirmation is transmitted directly to SE and after the mutual authentication of SSP and SE the secure channel is established and the secure electronic signature is created with the usage of the technical component (TC) being at SE's disposal. The final transfer of the signed document to AP depends on an individual SE's decision preceded by the verification of an obtained signature. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Electronic signature; Information security; Secure signature creation device",""

In order to protect organizational knowledge stored in or transferred through company's Knowledge Management Systems (KMS), information security controls have to be incorporated into these systems. However, overly strict controls may adversely impact the perceived usefulness of the system and consequently its usability. This research examines the impact of security measures on perceived usefulness of KMS. More specifically, we investigated the impact of security training, security policy and technology on the perceived usefulness of KMS. Security self-efficacy, perceived personal responsibility, content quality, and perceived ease of use were included as mediating factors. The proposed research model was tested empirically through a survey of 51 IT professionals working at a large public university who are currently using a secure knowledge repository. Results show that security training impacts perceived personal responsibility directly and through security self-efficacy of the user. KMS security level affects perceived ease of use both directly and through content quality of the system. As expected, perceived personal responsibility and perceived ease of use impact perceived usefulness of the KMS. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.","Knowledge Management System; Perceived usefulness; Security measures","Competition; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Management; Management information systems; Security of data; Competitive advantage; Content qualities; Information security controls; IT professional; Knowledge management system; Knowledge repository; Management strategies; Organizational knowledge; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Personal responsibility; Public universities; Research models; Security level; Security measure; Security policy; Security training; Self efficacy; Knowledge management"

However, every intrusion detection approach has been limited by their problems: signature-based intrusion detection can identify the known intrusions but cannot detect the novel intrusions, anomaly-based intrusion detection has the potential to detect all intrusions but has the limitation of a higher false alarm rate. For this reason, most existing intrusion detection techniques have not met the requirements for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a theoretical basis for intrusion detection to argue about their principles and to analyze the existing problems for intrusion detection in a quantified manner. The root causes of these problems are identified as model inaccuracy and model incompleteness as well as the distinguishability lack in the features utilized. In addition, we also found that static analysis [1], with a properly selected feature vector, is a promising intrusion detection technique in principle because it can avoid the quality issue of its behavior models. © 2005 IEEE.","","Electronic crime countermeasures; Mathematical models; Problem solving; Vectors; Information security infrastructure; Intrusion detection; Signature-based intrusion detection; Theoretical basis; Security of data"

This method has been shown to have significant drawbacks. For example, users tend to pick passwords that can be easily guessed. On the other hand, if a password is hard to guess, then it is often hard to remember. To address this problem, some researchers have developed authentication methods that use pictures as passwords. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the existing graphical password techniques. We classify these techniques into two categories: recognition-based and recall-based approaches. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each method and point out the future research directions in this area. We also try to answer two important questions: ""Are graphical passwords as secure as text-based passwords?""; ""What are the major design and implementation issues for graphical passwords?""

Among the issues, the job scheduling is a major problem since it is a fundamental and crucial step in achieving the high performance. The job scheduling problem has been known as a combinatorial -optimization problem. Scheduling in a Grid environment can be seen as an extension to the scheduling problem on local parallel systems. In the research, we focus on applying the technologies of RFID and Grid computing to the architecture of EPC network. In the view of EPC network, there are a lot of applications needing computing power of Grid to solve huge quantity of coming EPC data. According to the architecture of EPC network and the environment of Grid computing, they have several places homologous characteristics with each other. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm that modifies the traditional GA and integrates SA. Since the processes of GA and SA keep no memory, some problem's status visited before may be visited again. In order to overcome the drawback, we design a learning scheme to remember visited statues to reduce the probability of the re-visiting improvement the performance in the search space. It can help to find the optimal or Near-optimal scheduling efficiently and avoid the resource deadlock.

A system built out of such components needs to be able to use the most recent versions of these components no matter what their source. This paper presents an architecture in which an application will select the most appropriate component version from a variety of sources, including network discovery. The architecture is based on the dynamic class loading mechanisms of Java. It succeeds where current techniques fail due to lack of interoperability and inability to adapt to dynamic environments. The architecture allows an application to dynamically load components from a variety of sources including, local disk, remote service, and personalised techniques. It chooses the most appropriate component by using version control information. Security policies may be used to restrict the actions of components and the policies can be refined as new components are loaded. This ensures that an application can run with zero configuration but be continually updated in a safe manner.

Visualization techniques should be specifically designed or selected to align with one of the three identified stages of situational awareness - perception, comprehension, or projection - and with one of five standard uses of visualization: monitoring, inspecting, exploring, forecasting, or communicating. Greater value can be realized by selecting the right visualization technique to focus on each operational task, rather than searching for a single allencompassing solution to fit every need.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an important detection that is used as a countermeasure to preserve data integrity and system availability from attacks. Data mining is being used to clean, classify, and examine large amount of network data to correlate common infringement for intrusion detection. The main reason for using Data Mining Techniques for Intrusion Detection Systems is due to the enormous volume of existing and newly appearing network data that require processing. The amount of data accumulated each day by a network is huge. Several Data Mining techniques such as clustering, classification, and association rules are proving to be useful for gathering different knowledge for Intrusion Detection. This paper presents the idea of applying data mining techniques to intrusion detection systems to maximize the effectiveness in identifying attacks, thereby helping the users to construct more secure information systems. © 2005 IEEE.","Anomaly Detection; Data mining; Information Security; Intrusion Detection; Intrusion Detection System","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Data processing; Information technology; Intranets; Security of data; Security systems; Theorem proving; Clustering; Data integrity; Information systems; Intrusion Detection System (IDS); Data mining"

The results demonstrate to what extent different standards committees, guideline authors and expert groups differ in their opinions on what the important issues are in enterprise information security. The ISO/IEC 17799, the NIST SP 800-26, the ISF standards committees, the CMU/SEI OCTAVE framework authors and an expert panel at the Swedish Information Processing Society (DFS) are considered.

Furthermore, an information system is built into a part of infrastructure, and bears an important role. Therefore, the security countermeasures of the information system have been important subjects. In an information system, an adversary attacks an entity with a low security level. Therefore, the security level of all the entities should be unified into the common level. If it is under common directions of an administrative organization, the security level of each entity can be unified easily. However, in order that separate administrator may administer each entity, it is not easy to unify a security level. For example, in a Japanese Egovernment system, each ministry agency performs procurement and administration of their system. Therefore, the security level of each E-government system is not always the same. When each system is administered separately and it is moreover hard to commit legal force, in order to unify a security level, you have to recognize a mutual security level. In order to recognize a security level, evaluation and certification of a security system are important. Common Criteria is well known for evaluation and certification of the security level of a system. Common Criteria is the security criteria for evaluating whether from a viewpoint of information security, the product and system relevant to an information technology are designed appropriately and the design is implemented surely. It was recognized as ISO/IEC standards in June, 1999. However, in Common Criteria, the evaluation and certification of Cryptographic Module which are used with an information system have not been applicable. Cryptographic Module is functional block which offers the cryptographic function used with information systems and its security level needs to evaluate. It is necessary to perform evaluation of Cryptographic Module individually with Common Criteria evaluation. Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules which used in Government agency is already defined as FIPS 140-2 in the U.S. and Canada. And they cooperate with the Validation scheme. The system which the U.S. and Canada are operating is premised on unitary control. However, in many E-government system of Japan, the vendor of Cryptographic Module and the vendor of a system are in same company. When the vendor of Cryptographic Module and a system is in common, the specification of Cryptographic Module is not released in many cases. Therefore, much time is required in order to build a system like the U.S. and Canada. Then, we did the case study about the conditions for building up Cryptographic Module Validation system smoothly under the situation like Japan. In this paper, we report that result. © 2005 IEEE.","","Electronic crime countermeasures; Information technology; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Cryptographic Modules; e-government; Information systems; Module Validation systems; Cryptography"

To achieve these goals, information systems must be constructed upon solid software and system architecture foundations, and also must be created using sound software, cognitive, and information assurance methodologies. Since the dimensions of well-engineered information systems are too numerous to describe here, we cannot adequately cover all of their aspects.

The main goal of wireless sensor networks is to obtain globally meaningful information from strictly local gleaned by individual sensor nodes. The network is deployed such that the sensors are embedded, possibly at random, in a target environment. Utilizing the basic capabilities of sensor nodes in the network different types of monitoring and control applications that address the target environment can be developed. Depending on the application at hand, the interface between a sensor network and the outside world is provided by aircraft, helicopters, ground-based vehicles, satellites, co-located sink-nodes, etc. However, a wireless sensor network is only as good as the information it produces. In this respect, the most important concern is information assurance. Indeed, in most application domains sensor networks will constitute a mission critical component requiring commensurate security protection. Sensor network communications must prevent disclosure and undetected modification of exchanged messages. Due to the fact that individual sensor nodes are anonymous and that communication among sensors is via wireless links, sensor networks are highly vulnerable to security attacks. If an adversary can thwart the work of the network by perturbing the information produced, stopping production, or pilfering information, then the perceived usefulness of sensor networks will be drastically curtailed. Thus, security is a major issue that must be resolved in order for the potential of wireless sensor networks to be fully exploited.","","Military applications; Sensors; Telecommunication links; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Information assurance; Mission critical components; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Information services"

Such architectures, however, also bring about their own security challenges that require due consideration. Unfortunately, the current information security mechanisms are insufficient to address these challenges. In particular, the access control models today are mostly static and coarsely grained; they are not well-suited for the service-oriented environments where information access is dynamic and ad-hoc in nature. This paper outlines the access control challenges for Web services and SOA, and proposes an Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) model as a new approach, which is based on subject, object, and environment attributes and supports both mandatory and discretionary access control needs. The paper describes the ABAC model in terms of its authorization architecture and policy formulation, and makes a detailed comparison between ABAC and traditional role-based models, which clearly shows the advantages of ABAC. The paper then describes how this new model can be applied to securing web service invocations, with an implementation based on standard protocols and open-source tools. The paper concludes with a summary of the ABAC model's benefits and some future directions.","","Computer architecture; Distributed computer systems; Information dissemination; Interfaces (computer); Security of data; Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC); Service Oriented Architectures (SOA); System-to-system interfaces; Web services; Telecommunication services"

Many approaches have been proposed to tackle these problems, especially the denial of service (DoS) attacks. The Multiple Classifier System (MCS) is one of the approaches that have been adopted in the detection of DoS attacks recently. For a MCS to perform better than a single classifier, it is crucial for the base classifiers which embedded in the MCS to be diverse. Both resampling, e.g. bagging, and feature grouping could promote diversity of base classifiers. In this paper, we propose an approach to select the reduced feature group for each of the base classifiers in the MCS based on the mutual information between the features and class labels. The base classifiers being combined using the weighted sum is examined in this paper.

Resource constraints, medium pathless, and signal interference limit the communication range between any tow nodes, leading to the need for a multihop communication network. Such a network must be collaboratively formed and supported by the resource constraint nodes. For meaningful service provision, such a network must be able to provide confidentiality, integrity, and entity verification among participating nodes.

This is especially true in the oil and gas industries, where DCS are in wide use in the manufacture, processing, and distribution of products. The interconnection of SCADA and DCS, herein referred to as process control systems, or PCS, with corporate networks makes it possible to share information and remote operation of control functions at various locations in a facility, across a corporate network, or at remote locations. In such instances, the PCS is exposed to a set of cyber-related vulnerabilities that have the potential to be exploited by internal and external threats. The cyber-related exploitation of a PCS may pose consequences involving human health and safety, the environment, continuity of business operations, regulatory oversight, corporate liability, and stakeholder perceptions. Decision makers in the oil and gas industry are struggling to determine how secure their system is and how secure it needs to be, as well as how security risks contribute to business risks. Security metrics can help provide answers to these questions. Metrics evaluate aspects of security against a known scale or benchmark. Thus, system security can be described in measurable terms that can aid decision makers and operators in making security-related decisions. Security metrics support the management of cyber risks and the integration of cyber risk management into overall business risk management. The information security community has defined a variety of security metrics. Some are directly and immediately applicable to PCS stakeholders; others could be adapted or tailored to the PCS security problem domain. However, most security metrics activities and resources are not immediately relevant to PCS stakeholders. This paper summarizes initial findings of a research team sponsored by the Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection (I3P) to examine existing security metrics and their potential usefulness to PCS stakeholders: industry, PCS vendors and integrators, and government (www.thei3p.org). In this paper we present a brief overview of metrics and how they can be used to evaluate and enhance the security of PCS. We present an overview of existing and developing metrics systems, standards, and scoring tools that have the potential to be applied to PCS in the oil and gas industry. We also describe the challenges and ongoing efforts for developing new metrics tools specifically designed for the evaluation of PCS security and the recommendations provided by industry participants in a workshop sponsored by the I3P in June 2005.

The problem with current IT environments and security mechanisms forces equal sharing of all information at the lowest common denominator, often requiring setting up new physical networks to protect the information boundaries, which is often time-consuming, costly, and not interoperable. The recent technology evolution towards Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) helps establish a loosely coupled, interoperable ""system of systems"" platform, however they also bring about their own security challenges. This paper outlines the inefficiency of conventional network boundary based, protection-oriented information security mechanisms as well as the new security challenges for the emerging SOA technologies, and proposes Attribute Based Information Security (ABIS) as a new approach for addressing these challenges. Center to this new approach is a generic Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) model, which is based on subject, object, and environment attributes and supports both mandatory and discretionary access control needs. To realize the potentials of the ABAC model, the paper introduces a high level ABIS reference architecture, which reflects the proposed technical approaches to achieve an attribute-centric security methodology: First of all, to establish such an environment that facilitates the seamless flow of information between collaborating parties, the capability to provision and manage attributes for subjects and resources needs to be established. Secondly, attribute-binding mechanisms need to be in place to support the integrity and data assurance of the information objects. Next, the architecture should provide identification, authentication and authorization mechanisms based on the attributes. Building upon these tasks will lead to the establishment of ""Trusted Information Domains"" within a shared network infrastructure, providing the ability to establish logical COIs seamlessly, created as needed or modified as policy dictates. The paper explores the possibilities of extending the ABAC model to across trust domains, allowing multiple levels of policy enforcement and policy federation. © 2005 IEEE.","","Computer architecture; Copyrights; Data structures; Electronic document exchange; Military operations; Public policy; Attribute Based Information Security (ABIS); Communities of Interests (COI); Data assurance; Information sharing; Security of data"

Information exposure threats arise as a side effect of a particular choice of data management procedures employed during legitimate information use or possession in a specific context. They affect, in different forms, information throughout its lifetime in a ubiquitous computing environment. To maximize information availability, and thus its value to user, under unpredictably varying threat models, we depart form static and inflexible approaches to secure data management to provide for continuous and adaptive information exposure protection. We outline a means of structured reasoning about information exposure and introduce a metric for its quantification. An approach to threat mitigating information management operations discrimination based on information utility change is also presented. To unify the introduced concepts into a coherent big picture we form a Levels of Exposure model.

The ""insider threat"" involves the actions of a trusted and privileged user who is inappropriately accessing or disseminating sensitive information or otherwise compromising information systems. In contrast, the ""external threat"" involves the actions of an outsider attempting to compromise or gain access to the information systems. Although approaches for automatically detecting external threat instances have been quite successful (i.e., intrusion detection systems), there is very little similar work for the insider threat. In the past, anomaly detection systems have proven useful for detecting external threat. Anomaly detection at the system call level offers a high degree of information assurance in terms of tamper-resistance and system activity coverage. Therefore, we investigate three system-call-based feature representations: n-grams of system call names, histograms of system call names, and individual system calls with associated parameters. We find that none of these representations consistently performs as well when dealing with the internal threat as previous results show for external threat detection. However, parameter-based features for certain system calls do show some sensitivity to detecting the insider threat, and we plan to explore and enhance this sensitivity in future work. © 2005 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; Insider threat; Outlier detection; System calls","Information analysis; Information dissemination; Parameter estimation; Problem solving; Security of data; User interfaces; Anomaly detection; Insider threat; Outlier detection; System calls; Security systems"

First, it helps users to choose intended security policies flexibly. Besides it supports users to add new security policies according to specific security requirements easily. Finally it sets permission revocations immediately and gets no significant performance penalty.","","Classification (of information); Computer architecture; Computer science; Computer software; Security of data; Computer operating system - Linux; Policy Flexible Architecture (PFA); Revocation rules; Computer operating systems"

This module introduces students to the role of government, industry groups, and individual plants in maintaining as safe an environment as reasonably possible in an age of terrorism. The focus of the module is to tie elements of the course and curriculum previously discussed to a rapidly changing contemporary issue. Topics tied to the module include the role of government (executive and legislative roles and current activities in both with regard to plant safety, previously introduced in the context of safety and environmental law), green engineering (just-in-time production, waste minimization), fail-safes, and risk analysis (HAZOP and other methods).

Second, policies for information security must be developed, promulgated j and implemented. These policies must balance learning, experimentation, and openness with adequate security measures. Third, the current narrow and fragmented approach to information security practices must be expanded to a holistic, integrated view and the current reactive stance must be changed to a proactive, prescriptive orientation toward information security.

Despite numerous technological innovations for information assurance, it is still very difficult to protect computer systems. Therefore, unwanted intrusions take place when the actual software systems are running. Different soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to network intrusion detection, and the software implementation of the approach. The genetic algorithm is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data, and the support-confidence framework is utilized as fitness function to judge the quality of each rule. The generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing GA-based approaches, because of the simple representation of rules and the effective fitness function, the proposed method is easier to implement while providing the flexibility to either generally detect network intrusions or precisely classify the types of attacks. Experimental results show the achievement of acceptable detection rates based on benchmark DARPA data sets on intrusions, while no other complementary techniques or relevant heuristics are applied. © 2005 IEEE.","Genetic algorithms; Information assurance; Misuse intrusion detection; Software development; Support-confidence framework","Computer networks; Data reduction; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Internet; Real time systems; Software engineering; Detection rates; Information assurance; Misuse intrusion detection; Support-confidence framework; Security of data"

Conventional application security approaches that embed security into each critical application results into scattered security mechanism, which is not only difficult to manage but also creates security loopholes, Therefore, new unified enterprise application security concept is evolving in the industry that consists of centralized authentication, access control, incident response and auditing. Industries such as Computer Associate, Cerebit, Entrust, Evidian, IBM Tivoli, Netegrity, Oblix and SunOne have comes up with the identity and access management solutions that are based on this concept. Significant amount of misunderstanding exists in the industry and research community about appropriate features of such a unified product. Therefore we have proposed new enterprise application security (EAS) comparison framework to compare existing enterprise application security products. This framework helps an enterprise in selecting appropriate application security product. From comparison we found that Computer Associate and Netegrity solutionn are the best available solutions, however none of the current available solutions are providing complete enterprise application security.

Therefore, all feedback provided during their training into the medical profession is essential for the enhancement of those systems, moreover in terms of information security. The Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department of Porto Faculty of Medicine teaches Ethics and Medical Informatics to 1st year medical students. The later subject includes theoretical and practical lectures about Electronic Patient Records (EPR) and information security. This study aims to investigate the attitudes and awareness of 1st year medical students towards security issues relating to EPR. Methods: The students responded to the same questionnaire before Ethics and Medical Informatics' lectures at the beginning of the academic year of 2003/2004 and, again, at the end of the year after those lectures. This questionnaire was anonym and presented 3 scenarios. The first scenario described a breach of patient confidentiality by a colleague, asking whether students could recognize that breach (Q1A) and also, the attitude of the respondents in knowing about it (Q1B); the second asked if the students would alter their answer to Q1B by realizing that their colleague shared a password with a friend, and that friend committed the security breach (Q2); the third scenario asked if sensitive information (i.e. related to VIPs or sexual diseases) needs stronger security protection than other sensitive healthcare information (Q3). The answers were inserted in SPSS and analysed separately. Results: A total of 460 questionnaires were filled by the students. 52% (238) were answered before the lectures started, whilst 48% (222) after the lectures finished. In Q1A, 98% (450) of the answers were valid. At the beginning of the year 99% (232) of the students identified a security breach of EPR confidentiality, while at the end of the year, 100% (217) did the same. For Q1B, 60% (276) of the answers were valid. At the beginning of the year, 54% (77) students felt they would reason with the responsible for the breach, whilst 29% (42) affirm they would, instead, inform responsible authorities about that breach. At the end of the year, 44% (58) thought they would still talk with the responsible and 41% (54) would inform responsible authorities. In Q2, 62% (287) of the answers were valid. At the beginning of the year, 74% (109) of the students would not alter their answer to Q1B whilst, at the end of the year, 83% (115) thought the same. For Q3, 89% (410) of the answers were valid. At the beginning of the year, 44% (91) of the students felt no extra security measures should be applied, the main reason being the fact that all security measures must be effective for all cases, independently of the patient or healthcare performed. 55% (112) thought extra security measures were necessary because they affirm there is the need to protect certain social groups from discrimination. Again, at the end of the year, 38% (77) felt no extra security measures were needed whilst 62% (127) thought there were. Discussion: According to this study results, after Medical Informatics and Ethics lectures, students feel more conscientious to report confidentiality breaches to responsible parties (Q1B). They understand better how to behave in order to protect confidentiality of electronic information and consider indirect disclosure of sensitive information, such with another person's password, a serious fault (Q2). Further, at the end of the year, students become more aware for the need of different protection levels of security depending on how sensitive information can be (Q3). We believe that the introduction of Medical Informatics and Ethics early in the degree has an influence in the awareness and attitudes of first year medical students towards information security and EPR.","","attitude; biostatistics; conference paper; confidentiality; electronic medical record; ethics; human; information security; information system; medical informatics; medical student; priority journal; questionnaire"

The nonlinear autoregressive digital filters satisfying the Kelber conditions can also produce chaotic sequences just like chaotic maps do. The composite filter system consists of several above-mentioned filters, and the filter used for iteration is completely decided by a predetermined sequence called composite sequence. Consequently, the trajectory of the composite filter system is not only sensitive to its initial conditions, but also related with the composite sequence, which determines the choice of iterated sub-filter system in the iterating process. So the trajectory is more complex than that of general chaotic systems or single filter system. After analyzing some properties of composite filter systems such as N-dimensional uniform distribution and invariant distribution density function, a new keyed Hash algorithm based on composite system is presented. The approach selects the sub-filter system with the composite sequence obtained from message to be hashed, uses the initial iteration value of composite system as the secret key, and the coarse-grained trajectory as Hash value. Because of the sensitivity to initial value and randomicity of the iteration process, there is a very complex nonlinear relation between Hash value and the corresponding message and secret key, and then every bit of the Hash value derived from the message M is related with every bit of M. Furthermore, the filter-based algorithm is simple enough without complex operations, so it can be realized easily.","Chaos; Hash function; Nonlinear autoregressive digital filter",""

The primary goal is to provide strong enforcement of confidentiality and integrity policies: confidential data can be released only in permitted ways and trustworthy data must result from expected computations or conform to expected patterns. Such security policies are specified in the database layer and statically enforced for the rest of the system in an end-to-end fashion. In contrast with existing web-scripting languages, which provide only ad hoc mechanisms for information security, the scripting language described here uses principles based on the well-studied techniques in information-flow type systems. However, because web scripts often need to down-grade confidential data and manipulated untrusted user input, they require practical and convenient ways of down-grading secure data. To achieve this goal, the language allows safe downgrading according to downgrading policies specified by the programmer. This novel, pattern-based approach provides a practical instance of recent work on delimited release and relaxed noninterference and extends that work by accounting for integrity policies. © 2005 IEEE.","","Computer programming languages; Database systems; Security of data; World Wide Web; Information-flow control; Integrity policies; Security policies; Web-scripting language; Information analysis"

Such a vision poses substantial challenges to information security and privacy protection. Unlike in traditional, static, execution environments, information in the Ubiquitous world is exposed, throughout its lifetime, to constantly varying security and privacy threats caused by the inherent dynamicity and unpredictability of the new computing environment and its mobility. Existing data protection mechanisms, built for non- or predictably slowly-changing environments, are unable to strike the balance in the information availability vs. security and privacy threat trade-off in the Ubiquitous world thus hindering the feasibility of the overall vision. In this paper, we present our initial work on a novel paradigm for information security and privacy protection in the ubiquitous world. We model security and privacy threats through sets of contextual attributes and mitigate the projected risks through proactive and reactive data format transformations, subsetting and forced migrations while trying to maximize information availability.

We generalize the decentralized label model, which is about confidentiality and integrity, to also include security policies for availability. These policies characterize acceptable risks by representing them as principals. We show that in this setting, a suitable extension of noninterference corresponds to a strong, end-to-end availability guarantee. This approach provides a natural way to specify availability policies and enables existing static dependency analysis techniques to be adapted for availability. The paper presents a simple language in which fine-grained information security policies can be specified as type annotations. These annotations can include requirements for all three major security properties: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The type system for the language provably guarantees that any well-typed program has the desired noninterference properties, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. © 2005 IEEE.","","Availability; Computer crime; Computer programming languages; Data flow analysis; Data privacy; Information science; Security systems; End-to-end availability policies; Information flow analysis; Noninterference; Security policies; Security of data"

They are viewed as a technology that in the nearest future will handle most of the ""last mile"" communication traffic for the individual subscribers, corporate offices, military, and possibly deep space probes. Indeed, lasers allow for concentration of energy within tightly focused beams and narrow spectral interval, thus offering high throughput, information security, weight and size of components and power requirements that could not be matched by RF systems. However, the advantages of optical communication systems come in the same package with several major challenges. In particular, high data rates should be complemented by high-precision wide-bandwidth position control of a laser beam.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has developed a strategy to secure these vulnerabilities. Crucial to this strategy is the Control Systems Security and Test Center (CSSTC) established to test and analyze control systems and their components. In addition, the CSSTC promotes a proactive, collaborative approach to increase industry's awareness of standards, products and processes that can enhance the security of control systems.

As the technology develops and evolves to Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAVs) their application to new mission roles will continue to grow. Exploiting UAV/UCAV capabilities requires integration of the platform into existing and future communication systems such as the Global Information Grid (GIG). Assuring that these communications have proper information assurance (IA) protections is especially challenging. Depending on the mission needs, required IA services include: protecting data at rest, protecting data in transit, separating multiple classification levels of data and supporting multiple communications paths through diverse communication systems. Mission roles may require the UAV/UCAV to simultaneously support multiple communication protocols/waveforms, and multiple security protocols, operating at multiple levels of the IP stack (physical, link, network and application/application object levels). Given the frequent use of low-bandwidth connections, large latency and unreliable or intermittent links, IA services should assist other supporting services such as Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET), Mobile IP, and Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEP). Other constraints affect the design such as: Size, weight and power Costs, both non-recurring and operational Compliance with NSA/CSS Policy 3-9 (Cryptographic Modernization Initiative) Security services applied at multiple levels of the IP stack Support of standards based management such as SNMP Over-the-network provisioning of updated key material Over-the-network software update capability Releasability to allies and coalition partners The ideal solution is a single robust integrated IA device that supplies all these security services.

Many hospitals, however, have EHR systems for their internal use only, and the standardization process for the exchange of medical information is still in process. This standardization process addresses information security and is considering public key infrastructure (PKI) as one security measure, but PKI is rarely used by medical practioners because of its poor user-friendliness. Here we propose an effective use of the identity-based encryption (IBE) system as a security measure. This system enables us to send encrypted and signed messages without requiring the receiver to get a public key, and it enables us to deliver secured messages to ambiguous receivers like those to whom letters of reference are sent. We evaluated the feasibility of this technology by using the analytic hierarchy process, which is an effective analysis tool when selection and judgment depend on nonquantitative psychological factors, to analyze the results of an experiment in which medical workers used E-mail agents with and without PKI and IBE. We found that medical practioners and researchers avoid using PKI because of its poor user-friendliness and instead use IBE even though it is harder to install. We therefore think IBE would encourage medical institutions to share patient records.","E-mail; EHR; PKI; Security; Sharing patient record","Algorithms; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Security; Electronic Mail; Feasibility Studies; Hospital Information Systems; Humans; Japan; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Systems Integration; User-Computer Interface; algorithm; article; computer interface; computer network; computer security; e-mail; feasibility study; hospital information system; human; Japan; medical record; system analysis"
