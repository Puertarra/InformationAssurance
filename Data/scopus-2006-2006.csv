ARM processors are the most common for use in embedded devices. In this paper, we analyze speed and memory tradeoffs of AES, the leading symmetric cipher, on an ARM7TDMI processor. We give cycle counts as well as RAM and ROM footprints for many implementation techniques. By analyzing the techniques, we give the options we found which are the most useful for certain purposes. We also introduce a new implementation of AES that saves ROM by not explicitly storing all the SBOX data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","","Random access storage; Security of data; Arm7tdmi; Cycle count; Embedded device; High Speed; Implementation techniques; Software implementation; Symmetric cipher; Cryptography"

Various fingerprint recognition techniques, including fingerprint acquisition, classification, enhancement and matching, have been developed. This chapter overviews recent advances in fingerprint recognition techniques and summarizes algorithms proposed for every step with special focuses on the enhancement of low-quality fingerprints and the matching of distorted fingerprint images. Both issues are believed to be significant and challenging tasks. We also discuss the common evaluation for fingerprint recognition algorithms: Fingerprint Verification Competition 2004 (FVC2004) and Fingerprint Vendor Technology Evaluation 2003 (FpVTE2003), based on which we can measure the performance of recognition algorithms objectively and uniformly. In addition, fingerprint recognition has been increasingly used to realize personal identification in civilian’s daily life, such as fingerprint mobile phones, ID cards, fingerprint hard disks and so on. In this chapter, we introduce an application case: the fingerprint mobile phone which utilizes fingerprint recognition to ensure information security. It is composed of two parts: one is a front-end fingerprint capture subsystem, and the other is a back-end fingerprint recognition system based on smart phones. © 2006 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The camp has been offered twice and is conducted by Iowa State University professors in the security field, community experts, and graduate students that are in the security program at ISU. The camp provides an overview of computer security, educates students on computer networking security concepts, uses of different types of cryptography, and general understanding of how information warfare is conducted. This is a ""hands on"" lab-oriented camp that provides students an opportunity to work with state of the art equipment and to learn from industrial and academic leaders. Students will work with current technology like firewalls, Virtual Private Networks, and intrusion detection systems. Students setup security systems, analyze attacks, and see equipment in use. The last day of camp the students defend their networks against a red team ""hackers"" consisting of security professionals. One afternoon the students travel to Des Moines to tour different companies that are related to computer security. We expect students to gain interest in the area, broaden their knowledge on computer security, have fun, and meet faculty and experts that are able to answer questions about their occupations, and give them insight as to what the future could hold for them in computer security field. The camp will also perk their interest in coming to ISU or other universities after high school. This paper will outline the camp objectives, the planning process, and the recruitment process. The importance of a partnership between academia, government, and the private sector will be discussed. The changes from the first year to the second year based on feedback will also be presented in addition to plans for the third year. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.","","Computer networks; Knowledge acquisition; Professional aspects; Strategic planning; Students; Virtual reality; High school students; Information Assurance Center; InfraGard; Iowa State University; Security of data"

Engineering students must be kept aware of the role they will be expected to play in maintaining security in a plant environment and to protect the public from the worst of unexpected occurrences. With the rapid changes in chemical plant security that began well before 2001 and continue today, chemical engineering educators must be provided with current information pertinent to existing classes that will empower tomorrow's engineers to function effectively. A module developed to integrate topics in homeland security into a course in Ethics, Safety, and Professionalism is described. This module introduces students to the role of government, industry groups, and individual plants in maintaining as safe an environment as reasonably possible in an age of terrorism. The focus of the module is to tie elements of the course and curriculum previously discussed to a rapidly changing contemporary issue. Topics tied to the module include the role of government (executive and legislative roles and current activities in both with regard to plant safety, previously introduced in the context of safety and environmental law), green engineering (just-in-time production, waste minimization), fail-safes, and risk analysis (HAZOP and other methods). New topics include site vulnerability analysis, ventilation security, and cybersecurity.

Legal authorities warn that laws and regulations regarding information protection and privacy will continue to evolve over the next decade. These rules will continue to dictate how firms and government agencies protect and safeguard customer privacy information. The most effective and efficient way to guarantee compliance to these laws and regulations is through the adoption of risk management systems. Such a framework will provide a foundational information security management system leading to compliance and risk reduction and mitigation. Many functional areas within an organization practice risk management and deal with various aspects of risk management, including information security, business continuity planning (BCP), disaster recovery planning (DRP), insurance, finance, and internal auditing, to name a few.

Additionally, customer-facing portals and complex Web services architectures are adding a new complexity to information technology and making it more difficult to protect information. Managing access to information also becomes increasingly more difficult as security administrators struggle to keep up with new technology and integrate it into existing administrative functions. As organizations continue to pursue new business opportunities, move operations off-shore, and outsource day-to-day operations and development support, the “keys to the kingdom” and their information assets are increasingly at risk. No question, the business imperative supports accepting and mitigating this risk, thereby further enabling organizations to partner and team externally and electronically with business partners, customers, suppliers, vendors, etc.; however, if organizations wade into this environment blindly, without upgrading the existing information security infrastructure, technologies, tools, and processes, they may inadvertently put their organization at risk.

To make well informed decisions there is a critical need for information security risk management benchmarking - such benchmarking data depends, of course, on the availability of industry-wide data on security breaches and losses. A fundamental reason for non-availability of such data is that disclosure may risk reputation and financial damage. The paper takes a radically different approach to data availability by eliminating any disclosure of company-specific data while still making available aggregated results. This is achieved using a novel concept, called Trusted Query Network (TQN). The paper describes how TQN can let organizations anonymously share aggregated security assessment results while not storing or releasing the raw data outside the organization.

The main focus of this article is on steganography in B&W (black and white) pictures and making this possible on mobile phones considering the limitations in mobile phones. After receiving a picture message containing hidden data, the decoder program extracts the data and immediately changes the steganography places.

Adversaries could compromise network functionality by attacking the physical layer, the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer or the network layer. Even though security mechanisms for the network layer have been extensively discussed, MAC layer security has not been deeply explored. Leveraging security flaws in the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol and the salient features of a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), even an average person with limited knowledge of wireless networks can launch MAC-layer Denial of Service (DOS) attacks. In this paper, we study two types of MAC layer DOS attacks that can be easily employed by an average person: attacks launched from a single adversary by injecting enormous data flows into the network and attacks launched from two colluding adversaries by sending enormous data flows directly to each other. To counter the first attacks, we propose a packet-by-packet authentication scheme so that legitimate nodes can reject data transmission requests from unauthenticated adversaries. To mitigate the second attacks, we propose several counter measures such as a fair MAC protocol, using protecting traffic flows and distance adjustment. The contribution of this paper is that it reveals the attacks that could be launched by an average person, which is a potential threat to MANETs.

Simply write the data on a piece of paper, burn the paper, and scatter the ashes. No one will be able to read or alter that data ever again. Of course, this exercise and the underlying premise are a trick. Understanding the deception is the key to understanding information security: Data that is being “protected” has to remain available to legitimate users. There is a strong tendency for information security researchers and practitioners to focus on “securing” data by preventing attacks and loss of data. An IS practitioner's job might depend on preventing and recovering from security-related problems.

The review included the following four systems for possible use together with Maryland's existing Diebold AccuVote-TS (touch screen) voting system: VoteHere Sentinel; SCYTL Pnyx.DRE; MIT-Selker audio system; Diebold voter verified paper audit trail. As a baseline, we also examined the SBE's procedures for “parallel testing” of its Diebold system. For each system, we examined how it enables voters who use touch screens to verify that their votes are cast as intended, recorded as cast, and reported as recorded. We also examined how well it permits post-election auditing. To this end, we considered implementation, impact on current state voting processes and procedures, impact on voting, functional completeness, security against fraud, attack and failure, reliability, accessibility, and voter privacy. Our principal findings are, first, that each system we examined may at some point provide a degree of vote verification beyond what is available through the Diebold System as currently implemented, provided the system were fully developed, fully integrated with the Diebold system, and effectively implemented. Second, none of the systems is yet a fully developed, commercially ready product.

Executives could no longer overlook the importance of security; they finally recognized that information security was an issue that required proper diligence. It is no longer possible to plead ignorance, because nearly every trade magazine reports on incidents of security breaches on an almost daily basis. The catastrophe of 9/11 shed light on the scope and importance of information security.

The boundary between private and public moves dynamically depending on the context in which the issue is considered. As for access control for ubiquitous computing, the concept of consensual disclosure is an answer to the question of where the boundary should be drawn - Unless a user gives their explicit consent to opening the identity, perfect privacy, that is, anonymity and unlinkability are supported. This paper presents concrete protocols for anonymous and unlinkable access control that are appropriate for ubiquitous computing partly in the sense that they support consensual disclosure. The protocols presented in this paper are practical because they are efficient and based on a model that represents the real world. In particular, they support a characteristic of the key transfer: a service appliance acquires keys to decrypt contents of services, if, and only if, it accepts proof of access rights as presented by a user, and can prove that it is trusted by the service provider. Moreover, the protocols are provably secure.

Using different techniques and controls can multiply the effectiveness of security controls in an increasingly diverse risk environment. Using overlapping controls can also provide redundancy that is important if a control should fail. Information technology security controls and response processes address different areas within an environment. These include network controls, operating system controls, and application level controls, as well as monitoring and responses to security events. Attention must also be paid to the coverage of the different controls, as the failure to provide protection for one piece of the application or service may lead to compromise of other areas. Providing adequate protection for all the pieces of an application will ensure its proper functioning and reduce the risk of its being compromised. It is also possible for one control to provide overlapping protection for other areas. Maximizing the overlapping protection and providing diversity within each one of these controls and processes are important to minimizing the risk of a security failure with regard to the information or services being protected. In addition, response and monitoring processes must also be able to address incidents and provide solutions in a timely manner.

Since the founding of the People's Republic more than half a century ago, China's S&T cause has grown from scratch and made gigantic strides. However, China still lags considerably in making the shift from imitating others to making original innovation, from emphasizing single technological breakthrough to strengthening integrated technological upgrading, and from stressing technology orientation to promoting product and industry orientation. To quickly secure commanding heights in the 21st century hi-tech industries and achieve breakthrough in certain major technologies and their commercialization during the post-WTO grace period, the Chinese government has decided to launch a number of special S&T items and looks forward to their substantive success in five years. These include super large IC and software, information security, e-government and e-finance, electricity-powered automobile, functional genomics and biochips, dairy products, new drugs, and modernization of traditional Chinese medicine. In the IT area, efforts are being made to fundamentally change the basic monopoly of core foreign technologies by developing its own new concept of CPU, NC, and network software platforms. It aims to reverse the situation of not having drug products with China's own proprietary technologies by stepping up the R&D of new drugs and modernization of traditional Chinese medicine.

This basic operation can be extended to implement optical convolutions and correlations that can be useful for the processing of radar signals or pattern recognition (van der Lugt, 1964). This field has been brought near perfection during the past three decades by an improvement of the algorithms and the hardware, such as temporal and spatial light modulators.

Currently, there is no existing approach that addresses the root access requirement and the entire life-cycle of an assignment from problem definition, to turn-in of the end product. The Xen Worlds project is aimed at creating a versatile ""virtual lab"" where an entire network of virtual machines, (a Xen World), can be provided to each student that will allow on-campus and distance education students 24/7 access via SSH, allow students to turn-in a virtual machine or an entire network as the finished product and allow for grading to occur directly on those machines instead of grading a few select artifacts such as configuration files, programs or outputs. To achieve these goals, Xen Worlds builds on several open source products, including utilities for creating virtual network bridges and the Xen virtual machine monitor developed at the University of Cambridge. Combining these building blocks and custom software into a versatile architecture, it has been possible to create an environment that supports multiple backends; provides administrative tools to the students for starting, stopping, resetting, saving and turningin their virtual machines; isolating the Xen Worlds from each other; and allowing the instructor direct access to the virtual machines for grading purposes. The potential of this project was demonstrated by creating a prototype that provided 30 students with their own virtual machine for an entire semester, with all 30 virtual machines being run on a single desktop computer with a Pentium 4 processor and 2GB of RAM. An upper limit of 30 virtual machines being provided was dictated by the amount of physical RAM required by each virtual machine on the desktop computer. The current version of Xen Worlds spreads the virtual machines over many backend computers, allowing up to 240 virtual machines in arbitrary network topologies. Our current goal is to prove Xen Worlds' potential as an instructional tool, and demonstrate its lower cost compared to commercial solutions such as VMWare.

Simply write the data on a piece of paper, burn the paper, and scatter the ashes. No one will be able to read or alter that data ever again. of course, this exercise and the underlying premise are a trick. Understanding the deception is the key to understanding information security: Data that is being “protected” has to remain available to legitimate users. There is a strong tendency for information security researchers and practitioners to focus on “securing” data by preventing attacks and loss of data. An IS practitioners' job might depend on preventing and recovering from security-related problems.

In order to keep the cost down, a purchaser tends to send out the request for quotation for a group of potential suppliers. The purchaser will choose a supplier with the best combination of price and quality. Sometimes a potential supplier will try to collect the information about other suppliers so he/she can provide the best bid to the purchaser. Since most transactions are done through a computer network system such as Extranet or Internet, the confidentiality becomes very important between suppliers and the purchaser. The Bell-LaPadula model is one of security models for information confidentiality and has been adopted by military for a long time. Chen et. al. has proposed the application of Bell-LaPadula model in the design of supply chain network. In the Bell-Lapadula model a subject can be in one of different security clearance and an object can be in one of various security classifications. This paper attempts to model the security on the supply chain networks using Markov chain by combining subjects and objects as its states to simulate the security state transitions.","Bell lapaudula Model; Information security; Markov chain model; Security model; Supply chain netwoks","Bells; Engineering education; Information systems; Markov processes; Security of data; Information confidentiality; Markov chain models; Request for quotations; Security classification; Security clearances; Security model; State transitions; Supply chain network; Supply chains"

Testing BC/DR plans is done with regard to justifying the economic benefit of having BC/DR capabilities in place. A company that decides not to test its BC/DR plans will not know if those capabilities and documented procedures will work during a disaster and thus jeopardize survivability of the enterprise. The information security professional may be asked to assume the role of testing coordinator or facilitator.

Hence the world is becoming potentially more vulnerable to the loss of that technology. The lack of designed-in security and wide dissemination of hacker tools makes the prospect of asymmetrical threats very likely. To increase awareness and understanding of these and other security issues the Information Assurance Student Group and Iowa State University's Information Assurance Center created Cyber- Defense Competition (CDC). The Information Assurance Student Group organizes the competition and develops the scenario. The competition is held at a cyber security research facility at the university and the faculty members oversee the competition and provide the judging. The competition has been designed as a defense and survivability exercise where the participants need to minimize the risk of a security breech while ensuring necessary operational services are maintained. The competition is open to all students to promote a multidisciplinary approach since the information infrastructure is a multidisciplinary space. Teams participating in the exercise develop and implement security plans that safeguard their users and secure their networks. The students have several weeks to design and implement their defenses based on a scenario. The student teams (blue team) must then defend their network for 18 hours against a team of security professionals (red team). The students maintain a usable network and provide services to a group of users (green team). The green team provides a way to get others involved in the competition even if they are not computer experts. The first competition was held in the spring of 2005 and in the fall of 2005 the second competition was held. The spring of 2006 a regional competition will be held and student teams from other universities will be invited to participate. The competition consists of 12 teams of 3-4 students each.

Unfortunately, current methodologies to combat the insider threat have had limited success primarily because techniques have focused on these areas in isolation. The technology community is searching for technical solutions such as anomaly detection systems, data mining and honeypots. The law enforcement and counterintelligence communities, however, have tended to focus on human behavioral characteristics to identify suspicious activities. These independent methods have limited effectiveness because of the unique dynamics associated with the insider threat. The solution requires a multidisciplinary approach with a clearly defined methodology that attacks the problem in an organized and consistent manner. The purpose of this paper is to present a framework that provides a systematic way to identify the malicious insider and describe a methodology to counter the threat. Our model, the Multidiscipline Approach to Mitigating the Insider Threat (MAMIT), introduces a novel process for addressing this challenge. MAMIT focuses on the collaboration of information from the relative disciplines and uses indicators to produce a consolidated matrix demonstrating the likelihood of an individual being a malicious insider. The well-known espionage case study involving Robert Hanssen is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the framework.","Behaviour analysis; Counter espionage; Information security; Insider threat","Security of data; Anomaly detection systems; Behavioral characteristics; Behaviour analysis; Counter espionage; Insider Threat; Malicious insiders; Multi-disciplinary approach; Technical solutions; Behavioral research"

Threat assessments are used to evaluate the likelihood of adverse events, such as terrorism and crime, against a given asset as well as other hazards such as natural disasters that may affect business operations. As such, the focal points of threat assessments are assets (targets) and the threats that seek to compromise those targets. The process of threat assessment includes—threat identification, asset classification, and consequence/critical analysis. General threat assessments estimate the likelihood of adversarial attacks, including the type of adversary, their tactics, and their capabilities.

Metadata, or data about data, can contain many personal details about an entity. It is subject to the same risks and malicious actions personal data is exposed to. This paper presents a new perspective for information security and privacy. It is termed Meta Privacy and is concerned with the protection and privacy of information system metadata and metastructure details.

Within the culture of IA educators, there are two pedagogical strategies: defense assurance and attack understanding. Defense assurance focuses on appropriate ways to build and maintain systems that are less vulnerable to attack. Attack understanding focuses on strategies for attacking and how to defend against them. Curriculums that focus more on attack understanding can use isolated test beds to provide laboratory experiences for the students to attack and defend networks. In a face-to-face environment, the test bed isolation can be accomplished by excluding wireless, infrared, and EoP (Ethernet over Power) interfaces, disabling any removable media, and by having only power cables (i.e. no network cables) extend beyond the test bed. Unfortunately, the use of air-gap isolation is unsuitable in a distance education (DE) environment. Remote students must control equipment in the test bed and therefore must have some sort of access. Computer and networking equipment laboratories are provided in some defense-assurance-focused DE courses, but the access methodology is usually designed to only prevent external access by unauthorized machines. This can be accomplished by using a VPN concentrator or other access firewall. In the case of attack-understanding-based laboratories, the access methodologies employed must guarantee the prevention of any attack escaping the confines of the test bed. Take the example of a demonstration of worm propagation via email attachments. The attacking machine sends an email to the victim machine that has a worm attached as an executable file. As part of the lab exercise the victim machine executes the file, installing the worm on the victim machine. The attacking machine then gains access to some resource on the victim machine. In a DE environment, the educator is responsible for ensuring that the worm cannot escape the isolated environment. This paper discusses secure student access and network isolation techniques for DE network test beds and proposes the use of IP-based KVM switches as a mechanism for guaranteeing test bed isolation while maintaining remote access for the students. Tradeoffs of cost, capability, maintainability, and degree of isolation are also discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.","","Distance education; Ethernet; Information technology; Intrusion detection; Remote control; Ethernet over Power; Information assurance; Power cables; Computer networks"

It provides a mechanism by which investments in security technologies may be justified. However, most risk analysis techniques are anchored in probability assumptions. Probability-based risk calculations depend on frequency data. An analysis of publicly available information security statistics shows how there is fundamentally insufficient data available to support rational frequency calculations of risk. Most of the available automated risk analysis tools depend on user estimates of the risk frequency. The validity of such estimates is unclear. The limitations of probability-based risk analysis are worsened in some risk settings. For example, settings where the risks under consideration are rare or unpredictable are problematic for frequency-based analysis. Such settings include events like natural disasters and terrorist attacks. Managers, organizational leaders, and information security designers facing problems in business continuity and information warfare share the problem of managing for improbable and unpredictable events using frequency-based tools that are inadequate for even the ideal risk analysis settings. An analysis of one alternative risk calculation, possibility-based risk analysis, shows how an alternative theoretical base can address limitations of frequency-based risk analysis and provide improved decision support for business continuity and information warfare.","Business continuity planning; Disaster recovery; Information security; Information warfare; Risk analysis","Decision support systems; Disasters; Information technology; Probability; Risk analysis; Security of data; Tools; Analysis techniques; Business continuity planning; Disaster recovery; Information technology risks; Information warfare; Rational frequencies; Risk analysis tools; Security technology; Risk assessment"

The use of wireless technology can improve and fasten healthcare treatment because it brings information to the point of decision allowing also for users' mobility. This use has to comply with security requirements as the wireless technology introduces some specific security problems. The main objective of this work is to model and develop a proposal for a secure wireless architecture in order to access a VEPR. This VEPR is being used within a university hospital by more than 500 doctors, on a daily basis. Its users would greatly benefit if this service would be extended to a wider part of the hospital and not only to their workplace. They would achieve faster and greater mobility in the treatment of their patients. The wireless architecture includes the latest wireless security standards and protocols, and models security requirements according to users and organizations' needs. It provides an extra security layer to the wired system.

To study these interactions, the paper adopts the circuits of power, a theoretical framework taken from the social sciences, and applies it to understanding the creation and development of the first standard in information security management. An informal group of UK security chiefs sparked off a process which led first to BS7799, the British standard, and later to ISO 17799, the international standard. The case study portrays how the institutionalization of this ad hoc development process results from the interactions of power among the stakeholders involved.

The challenges of solving compliance, the rate of new threat emergence, and the increasing means of attack vectors keep security management dynamic. Stopping hackers has always been a catch-up game. Application developers create bugs, hackers create exploits, systems become vulnerable to threats, then security and application vendors respond. The system works to reduce risk of system hacking, but it is always a race against the clock. Generally, criteria for testing security controls revolve around functionality of the device. Performance, manageability, scalability, time to security updates, usability, capacity, reporting, and so forth. The traditional approach to this problem is to combine the efforts of a vulnerability management (VM) practice with a threat management (TM) practice.","","Personal computing; Security of data; Application developers; Attack vector; Intelligent information; Security controls; Security management; Threat management; Vulnerability management; Program debugging"

First we point out that this claim is irrelevant for the security of the idealized/mathematical communicator because it violates basic assumptions. Furthermore, in general practical applications, as it has been pointed out in the very first paper, the use of thermal noise is disadvantageous therefore the issue of temperature and its accuracy is unimportant even for the security of common practical realizations. It is important to emphasize that any deviation from the idealized scheme can lead to a finite level of security. Thus, if the above-mentioned author had stressed the inaccuracy of the resistor values; his claim would have been practically valid. However the impact of such systematic errors can be kept under control. Here we cite our relevant analysis (Phys. Lett. A 359, (2006) 741-744) of 1% voltage inaccuracy along the line due to wire resistance effects, which can be considered as a general result for inaccuracies of this order. The necessity to build a statistics to extract information during the properly chosen clock time leads to extremely poor eavesdropper statistics and this situation provides a good practical raw bit security that can be orders of magnitude beyond the raw bit security of idealized quantum communicators. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","Secure classical communication with Johnson-like noise and Kirchhoff loop",""

With the bit decomposition and spread-spectrum communication techniques, the original gray-level watermark is mapped to 8 watermark volumes which can be directly embedded to the host. The original volume data are decomposed based on 3D-DWT to one-level resolution sub-band coefficients. Watermark volumes are embedded to these coefficients with 3D-DCT.

The fastest research Web servers are event-driven, as is the most common operating system for sensor nodes. An event-driven program handles concurrent logical tasks using a cooperative, application-level scheduler. The application developer separates each logical task into event handlers; the scheduler runs multiple handlers in an interleaved fashion. Unfortunately, the loose coupling of the event handlers obscures the program's control flow and makes dependencies hard to express and detect, leading to subtle bugs. As a result, event-driven programs can be difficult to understand, making them hard to debug, maintain, extend, and validate. This talk presents recent approaches to event-driven software quality based on static analysis and testing, along with some open problems. We will discuss progress on how to avoid buffer overflow in TCP servers, stack overflow and missed deadlines in microcontrollers, and rapid battery drain in sensor networks.

A central part of the net-centric environment is providing data to users when and where needed to enable effective decision making.

This dynamic RBAC constraint will check by one or more context constraints to assign the right permissions. With our approach we aim to preserve the advantages of RBAC and offer an additional means for the definition and enforcement of fine-grained context-dependent access control policies.

Unlike cryptography, steganography conceals the existence of a secret message by embedding it in an innocuous container digital media, thereby enabling unobstrusive communication over insecure channels. Detection and extraction of steganographic contents is another challenge for the information security professional and this activity is commonly known as steganalysis. Recent progress in steganalysis has posed a challenge for design and development of stegosystems with high levels of security and survivability. In this paper, different strategies have been presented that can be used to escape detection and foil an eavesdropper having high technical capabilities as well as adequate infrastructure. Based on the strength and weaknesses of current steganographic schemes, ideas have been progressed to make detection and destruction of hidden information more difficult. © 2006, DESIDOC.","Bit-substitution; Communication security; Cryptography; Information security; Secure communication; Steganalysis; Steganography; Stegosystem; Transform-domain; Undetectability","Communication systems; Digital devices; Information analysis; Information use; Security of data; Bit-substitution; Communication security; Steganalysis; Steganography; Stegosystems; Transform-domain; Undetectability; Cryptography"

Authentication Codes and Combinatorial Designs presents new findings and original work on perfect authentication codes characterized in terms of combinatorial designs, namely strong partially balanced designs (SPBD). Beginning with examples illustrating the concepts of authentication schemes and combinatorial designs, the book considers the probability of successful deceptions followed by schemes involving three and four participants, respectively. From this point, the author constructs the perfect authentication schemes and explores encoding rules for such schemes in some special cases. Using rational normal curves in projective spaces over finite fields, the author constructs a new family of SPBD. He then presents some established combinatorial designs that can be used to construct perfect schemes, such as t-designs, orthogonal arrays of index unity, and designs constructed by finite geometry. The book concludes by studying definitions of perfect secrecy, properties of perfectly secure schemes, and constructions of perfect secrecy schemes with and without authentication.

To reduce the possibilities of such threats, studies on security risk analysis in the field of information security technology have been actively conducted. However, it is very difficult to analyze actual causes of damage or to establish safeguards when intrusions on systems take place within the structure of different assets and complicated networks. Therefore, it is essential that comprehensive preventive measures against intrusions are established in advance through security risk analysis. Vulnerabilities and threats are increasing continuously, while safeguards against these risks are generally only realized some time after damage through an intrusion has occurred. Therefore, it is vital that the propagation effects and levels of damage are analyzed using real-time comprehensive methods in order to predict damage in advance and minimize the extent of the damage. For this reason we propose a modeling technique for information systems by making use of SPICE and Petri-Net, and methods for analyzing the propagation effects and levels of damage based on the epidemic model. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","Damage propagation; Epidemic; Intrusion; Risk analysis; Safeguard","Computer simulation; Electronic crime countermeasures; Mathematical models; Risk assessment; Security of data; Security systems; Damage propagation; Epidemic; Intrusion; Risk analysis; Safeguards; Information technology"

Precedence is the user's indication of the importance of a message. In voice networks, the PBAS capabilities are implemented using Multilevel Precedence and Preemption (MLPP) so that the most important messages get through when either the called end-user is busy or the network is stressed. In the GIG, the PBAS capabilities must be extended to all applications beyond voice and must be implemented in an IP-based Quality of Service (QoS) architecture. Here we investigate the QoS component of Assured Service (AS). This paper does not address the other two components of Assured Service, which are Quality of Protection (QoP) and Information Assurance (IA). The focus of this paper is on those requirements which would impact the architecture choices for an IP-based packet enterprise transport network, specifically the DoD GIG converged IP transport network. Most existing discussions of Precedence and Preemption requirements are presented in the context of traditional circuit-based voice services. This paper focuses on the technical requirements and architectural alternatives needed for the implementation of PBAS capabilities in a global enterprise IP-based transport network, irrespective of the applications being transported. This analysis discusses options and tradeoffs for architectures, engineering designs and operational implementations based upon the technical requirements. These options and tradeoffs can be the basis for recommendations for supporting PBAS in the GIG.","","Information services; Internet protocols; Message passing; Network management; Architectural analysis; Global information grids; Quality of Protection (QoP); Transport networks; Packet networks"

Fast modular exponentiation algorithms are often considered of practical significance in public-key cryptosystems. The RSA cryptosystem is one of the most widely used technologies for achieving information security. The main task of the encryption and decryption engine of RSA cryptosystem is to compute ME mod N. Because the bit-length of the numbers M, E, and N would be about 512 to 1024 bits now, the computations for RSA cryptosystem are time-consuming. In this paper, an efficient technique for parallel computation of the modular exponentiation is proposed and our algorithm can reduce time complexity. We can have the speedup ratio as 1.06 or even 2.75 if the proposed technique is used. In Savas-Tenca-Koc algorithm, they design a multiplier with an insignificant increase in chip area (about 2.8%) and no increase in time delay.

The authors provide a holistic Corporate Capital Protection Assurance model consisting of effective due diligence controls so that any organization regardless of its size or state of maturity can provide assurance to its members and stakeholders that all relevant 'Corporate Capital' (in the widest sense including aspects like intellectual capital, brand name, electronic assets, public opinion, trust, human capital, competitiveness etc) will be adequately protected. Corporate Capital Protection Assurance is more than information security protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. It includes the aspects mentioned above, as well as the policies, procedures, processes and human skills that must be protected. Therefore the authors have defined Corporate Capital Protection Assurance as the management commitment and leadership, with all the supporting people and structures all working together to provide for the adequate protection of the company's Corporate Capital. Thus Corporate Capital Protection Assurance entails more than information security and information security governance. It includes for e.g. the protection of a digital forensic infrastructure, aspects relating to risk management, to business continuity planning and control, to the protection of human resource information, knowledge and human resource skills, as well as the protection of information relating to policy formulation and content. All of theses aspects need to be controlled in a formalized cohesive manner so that they are aligned with the overall business strategy and culture of the organization. This model will provide a consolidated view of all these above-mentioned types of corporate capital resources that cannot alone be protected by Information Security Governance controls and yet still require that require protection. Therefore this paper will provide a consolidated view of all these types of protection that should be provided by an organization, as well as provide a detailed exposition on the creation of and use of this Corporate Capital Protection Assurance model for organizations globally. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","Corporate Capital Protection and Assurance; Corporate governance; Digital forensic governance; Information security governance; IT governance; Project management governance","Data privacy; Industrial management; Intellectual property; Laws and legislation; Mathematical models; Project management; Risk management; Security of data; Capital Protection Assurance models; Corporate governance; Digital forensic governance; Information security governance; Electronic commerce"

Delayed counter-measures lead to delays in damage recovery as well as failure of timely actions to mitigate the damages.

Systems used by utilities and service industries such as electricity, water, wastewater treatment and gas are key components of these critical infrastructures. These critical infrastructures rely on a range of technologies commonly known as Process Control Systems in the production, distribution or management aspects of their services. To ensure continued delivery of these critical services, it is important to ensure that the process control systems used to control, monitor and manage the infrastructure are secured against physical and cyber security threats. A number of information security standards have been defined by various industry and government regulatory bodies to provide guidance in securing process control systems. However, managing compliance to several standards can become an added administrative overhead to organizations.

This research seeks to understand the work practices of these human analysts to inform the design of a task-appropriate information visualization tool to support network intrusion detection analysis tasks. System design will follow a user-centered, spiral methodology. System evaluation will include both a field-based qualitative evaluation, uncommon in information visualization, and a lab-based benchmarking evaluation.","HCI; Information visualization; Intrusion detection; Network security","Computer crime; Data reduction; Information retrieval; Security of data; User interfaces; Visualization; Human computer interaction; Information analysis; Information systems; Network security; Information visualization; Intrusion detection; Network security; Essential component; Human components; Information visualization; Network data; Network traffic; Potential attack; Qualitative evaluations; Support networks; System evaluation; User-centered; Work practices; Telecommunication traffic; Intrusion detection"

Security evaluation of information security system is broadly used with respect to Common Criteria (CC) as ISO standards (ISO/IEC 15408:1999). The standardization of process assessment results is a key point for solving the problems. This paper suggests XML-based approach to introduce the establishment of compatible environments for process improvement on the Web. In this paper, we focus on creating SPIE (Software Process Improvement Environments) for wide acceptance of process improvement on the Web.

This new paradigm involves coordinating and sharing computing, application, data, storage, and network resources across dynamic and possibly geographically dispersed organizations. To attract organizations to take advantage of off-the-shelf ready-to-build commodity clusters, substantial improvements have been realized in many areas such as resource allocation and management, process distribution and recovery, data integrity and application security. However, the primary factor above all others as we approach this new level of computing is trust - higher confidence in the privacy and security of data and resources is needed to advance to the next level. Most organizations avoid running applications using their private data on systems that are not under their control until a sufficient confidence of trust is built. Proofs of information security help build a higher level of trust and thus increase the utilization of the shared cluster. When launch applications on computer systems, five potential security threats arise at user, protocol, system, communication and hardware levels. To secure information, each level has to execute a set of protection tasks. Full trust will be achieved after all levels are proven immune from attack. In a conventional system, security is guaranteed if the hosting system is wholly controlled by the applications. Therefore, to protect confidential data between applications in a shared system, the traditional approach is to separate the entire system by either spatial or time methods. Here we introduce a resource separating and grouping mechanism that physically and logically separates system resources by adaptable scale to eliminate security problems and reduce the overall cost. © 2006 IEEE.","Data security; Resource management; Virtual machines","Data storage equipment; Distributed computer systems; Network protocols; Parallel processing systems; Problem solving; Program processors; Resource allocation; Private data; Process distribution; Resource management; Virtual machines; Security of data"

The method involves double random-phase encoding, fully phase-based encryption and a combined nonlinear JTC and a classical 4f-correlator for simultaneous recognition and authentication of multiple images. The encoded signal fulfils the general requirements of invisible content, extreme difficulty in counterfeiting and real-time automatic verification. Four reference images, double-phase encoded and encrypted in an ID tag are compared with the input images obtained in situ from the person or the vehicle whose authentication is wanted and from a database. Optical ID tags are satisfactory items to achieve remote and real-time optical authentication. On the one hand, effort has been focused on the tag design to provide a positive identification even though the receiver captured the ID tag under some distortion. On the other hand, demands on increasing security require ciphering the information prior to include it in the ID tag. A recognition step based on the correlation between the retrieved signature and a stored reference determines the authentication or rejection of the object under surveillance. In this work, we combine optical ID tags with the multifactor authentication procedure. Instead of basing the identification on a unique signature or piece of information, our goal is to authenticate a given person, object, or vehicle, by the simultaneous recognition of several factors. Some of them are intrinsic to the person and vehicle under control. Other factors, act as keys of the authentication step. The information of the whole set of factors is included in the ID tag. Remote identification of all factors is achieved. Such a system is proposed to control the access of people and vehicles in restricted areas, where the demand of security is high.","Fourier optics; Information security; Nonlinear correlation; Optical encryption; Optical ID tags; Optical recognition","Encoding (symbols); Fourier optics; Optical correlation; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Security systems; Nonlinear correlation; Optical encryption; Optical recognition; Random phase encoding; Electronic document identification systems"

In particular, to achieve IA, young and dynamic developing technologies and products should be using a defined lifecycle that leverages and builds (throughout the developmental lifecycle) on a rich and proven body of knowledge and practices in risk assessment and management. The lifecycle of software development must include the following (not necessarily sequentially): the needs and requirements; specifications; contractor selection; conceptual design; systems integration, demonstration, and validation; engineering manufacturing, development, and production; and maintenance and major upgrade. In addition to addressing the functionality of the lifecycle development, from the risk analysis perspective it is just as important to focus on (1) the people's perspectives - namely, the individual, the team, the management, and the stakeholder, (2) the hardware-software perspectives, especially the risks associated with the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and (3) the environment within which the entire system operates. This paper follows and builds on two papers previously published in this journal on the risks of terrorism associated with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and other cyberdependent systems. Its thesis is that the reliability and integrity of such systems, and thus, the corresponding interdependent infrastructures served by them, are contingent on the following three principles of IA and cybersecurity. Adhering to these principles can be instrumental in achieving the desired level of IA and cybersecurity: (1) Risk of software intrusion must be assessed and managed throughout the lifecycle of software development, focusing on both the functionality of software development and on the people involved in the process, knowing that hackers will exploit every weakness in the system. (2) Achieving information assurance and cybersecurity must be placed high on the priority list of top management. {The two are intricately dependent on software quality and telecommunications fidelity). This is synonymous with performing a holistic risk assessment and management. (3) Risk management of cyberterrorism must be the domain priority of the entire development team and the organization's management. It must be achieved from the perspectives of the total system throughout the software and system development's lifecycles. Building on the multifarious sources of risk envisioned during the lifecycle of software development through Hierarchical Holographic Modeling, resilience in cybersecurity through risk management is discussed.

Interconnecting GIG networks and nodes, while supporting DoD's ongoing commitment towards IA, requires securing the peering sessions and routing information exchanges within the GIG routing control plane. Based on large-scale incidents on the Internet, elements within the routing control plane are particularly susceptible to vulnerabilities given insufficient preventive measures. A combination of adopting best common industry practices for hardening routing protocols, utilizing inherent routing protocol security features and leveraging additional next-generation network security measures will prevent the GIG from both intended and inadvertent insider and outsider attacks. Because the GIG network topology differs vastly from those based on Internet-like conditions, routing protocols will encounter the severest of network conditions. The advent of network mobility within the tactical regions of the GIG presents newfound challenges in terms of the operational costs and complexity of traditional routing security mechanisms. Robustness of the routing control flows under any condition or under any network attack is placed at the forefront of operational concerns. An in-depth security analysis of GIG inter-and intra-domain routing protocols in consideration is provided, thus allowing GIG network architects the capability to design their networks according to recommendations for maintaining message confidentiality and integrity, performing route peer authentication and authorization, utilizing adequate route policy and filtering mechanisms, and ensuring route origin authentication and path validity.","","Control system analysis; Information analysis; Intelligent agents; Internet protocols; Robustness (control systems); Security of data; Topology; Department of Defense; Global Information Grid; Routing information exchanges; Grid computing"

It will provide incentive (through lowered premiums) to firms to better secure their network thus reducing the threat of first party as well as third party damage, promote gathering and sharing of information security related incidents thus aiding development of global information security standards and practices, and finally, increase the overall social welfare by decreasing the variance of losses faced by individual firms via risk pooling as in other kinds of insurance. However, a unique aspect of cyber-risks is the high level of correlation in risk (e.g. worms and viruses) that affects both the insurer and the insured. In this paper, we present a discussion on the factors that influence the correlation in cyber-risks both at a global level, i.e. correlation across independent firms in an insurer's portfolio, and at a local level, i.e. correlation of risk within a single firm. While global risk correlation influences insurers' decision in setting the premium, the internal correlation within a firm influences its decision to seek insurance. We study the combined dynamics of these two to determine when a market for cyber-insurance can exist. We address technical, managerial and policy choices influencing both kind of correlations and welfare implications thereof. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","","Decision making; Internet; Risk assessment; Security of data; Cyber-insurance; Global information security standards; Internal correlation; Artificial intelligence"

Design/methodology/approach - The project used a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The grounded theory approach was used to analyze responses to open-ended questions answered by 220 certified information system security professionals. Using these responses, a survey instrument was developed. Survey results were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings - Evidence suggests that top management support is a significant predictor of an organization's security culture and level of policy enforcement. Research limitations/implications - During instrument validation, a special effort removed survey items that appeared overly intrusive to the respondents. In this endeavor, an expert panel of security practitioners evaluated all candidate items on a willingness-to-answer scale. While especially helpful in security, this scale may be used in other research domains. Practical implications - Practitioners should understand the impact of top management support on achieving security effectiveness. Based on the findings of this study, low levels of executive support will produce an organizational culture less tolerant of good security practices. Low levels of support will diminish the level of enforcement of existing security policies.

The low costs and high benefits of the spammers, and the high costs and low benefits of the spammed determine the illegal nature of the spamming. The spam poses challenges for e-mail recipients'property rights, fair trade, public morals, cybersecurity, personal data protection, and involves other concerns as well. In dealing with spam, technical and marketing solutions cannot work alone without the legal mechanisms. The legal regulation is justified by balancing the interest between senders, service providers and even users. Criminal sanctions, civil remedies, and international harmonization are alternative steps in establishing legal solutions. As a necessary part of the legislation, punishment for unsolicited commercial e-mails should be more severe Still, there are a number of limitations to the effectiveness of law enforcement against spamming, Spam must be eliminated by comprehensive mechanisms.

Design/methodology/approach - Four propositions were developed based on the literature and case studies in eight companies that used e-auctions for sourcing. Measures were developed for lack of e-auction knowledge, lack of supplier participation, information security concerns and importance of supplier relationships. Survey data were gathered from 163 US National Association of Purchasing Management members. GLM-MANOVA was used to test the propositions. Findings - E-auction adopters perceive information security to be less of a concern than non-adopters. No significant differences were found between adopters and non-adopters on the buyer's e-auction knowledge, lack of supplier participation, and the importance of supplier relationships. Research limitations/implications - The small sample size limits statistical power, so small differences may not have been detected. The results may not generalize beyond the sample. Practical implications - Supply managers should focus on reducing information security concerns within their organizations to facilitate adoption.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on literature review, a research model was formulated by extracting the antecedents of ISM, and an empirical study was conducted to show how the organizational factors influence organizations in carrying out BS7799. Findings - The study result revealed that there were significant impacts of organizational factors, including IT competence of business managers, environment uncertainty, industry type, and organization size, on the effectiveness of implementing ISM. Research limitations/implications - The sample is limited to the organizational factors in Taiwan. It is suggested to replicate this study in other countries to reconfirm the result before adopting its general implications. Owing to the highly intrusive nature of ISM surveys, a cautious approach with rapport and trust is a key success factor in conducting empirical studies on ISM. Practical implications - IT competence is conducive to ISM implementation through subjective norms, leadership, belief, and behavior of ISM activities. Environmental uncertainty positively influences the need for greater innovation, which increases the dependence on IT, and therefore makes the effectiveness of ISM more desirable. Companies in an industry sensitive to security threats should pay more attentions to ISM practice. Corporate executives should also realize the size difference for adopting appropriate ISM strategies.

The shadows do not need to be changed when the shared secret is renewed, the access structure is altered, or old participants are deleted/new participants are added. All these shadows are shorter than or as short as the shared secret. Each participant shares many secrets with other participants by holding only one shadow, and in the recovery phase each participant is allowed to check whether another participant provides the true information or not.

While domain name information is typically created and updated off-line, dynamic DNS updates allow clients to manage domain names online, in real time. The current secure DNS standards (DNSSEC) require private keys to be kept online to sign dynamic updates, leaving private keys subject to network-based attacks. In this work, we develop a secure implementation framework of DNS servers that voids the above requirement. Our approach, called Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance (SCIT), strengthens DNSSEC through hardware redundancy. Our system uses a highly integrated cluster of DNS servers that constantly rotates the role of individual servers, handles one-server failures gracefully, confines the damages of successful intrusion to a limited time, and digitally signs dynamic updates by a clean server using the DNS zone key while keeping the key offline at all times. It is our belief that the availability and integrity of critical communications infrastructure, such as DNS, far outweigh the costs of hardware redundancy. In this paper, we present (1) the architecture of SCIT DNS clusters that achieves the above goals, (2) a secure Cluster Coordination Protocol (CCP) that servers in the cluster use to coordinate role changes without ever opening a port, and (3) the designs of our ongoing SCIT DNS cluster prototype. Preliminary experiences of our prototype show that role rotation and self-cleansing cycles are in the range of minutes, restricting the damages of even undetected but successful attacks to short time windows. © 2006 - Press and the authors.

In this context, information assurance (IA) refers to methodologies to protect engineering information by ensuring its availability, confidentiality, integrity, nonrepudiation, authentication, access control, etc. In collaborative design, IA techniques are needed to protect intellectual property, establish security privileges and create ©need to know"" protections on critical features. This paper provides a framework for information assurance within collaborative design based on a technique we call Role-Based Viewing. We extend upon prior work to present Hierarchical Role-Based Viewing as a more flexible and practical approach since role hierarchies naturally reflect an organization's lines of authority and responsibility. We establish a direct correspondence between multilevel security and multiresolution surfaces where a hierarchy is represented as a weighted directed acyclic graph. The permission discovery process is formalized as a graph reachability problem and the path-cost can be used as input to a multiresolution function. By incorporating security with collaborative design, the costs and risks incurred by multiorganizational collaboration can be reduced. The authors believe that this work is the first of its kind to unite multilevel security and information clouded with geometric data, including multiresolution surfaces, in the fields of computer-aided design and collaborative engineering.

Initially, audit mode, operation mode, penetration degree, company size, number of business sites, and type of industry are considered to be the factors that could influence the labor time, and thus the ""quantitative analysis I"" is conducted with these factors. However, it was revealed that the number of business sites and the type of business do not exert decisive influence on labor times. Therefore, our analysis was done, employing these four as factors: audit form, operation form, penetration degree, and business site size. However, the results were not sufficiently positive. As a result, by dividing audit mode into regular and emergency audit and by using company size as the factor, labor time estimation formula has been established by means of the regression analysis. Compared to the traditional estimation by skilled systems engineers with around 15% error, this proposed formula has 6 to 11% error, which means that this formula has enough practical accuracy.","Audit plan; Information security audit; Labor time estimation; Labor times; Quantitative analysis I; Regression analysis","Administrative data processing; Estimation; Information analysis; Management; Mathematical models; Personnel; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Statistical methods; Audit plan; Information security audit; Labor time estimation; Skilled systems; Security of data"

For managers, building and implementing an information security policy (ISP) has long been assumed to be an effective managerial measure to elevate an organization's security level. This paper attempts to investigate the dominant factors for an organization to build an ISP, and whether an ISP may elevate an organization's security level? Design/methodology/approach A survey was designed and the data were collected from 165 chief information officers in Taiwan. Findings The empirical results show that some organizational characteristics (business type and MIS/IS department size) might be good predictors for the ISP adoption and that the functions, contents, implementation and procedures of an ISP may significantly contribute to managers' perceived elevation of information security. Practical implications Building or adopting an ISP is examined empirically to be an effective managerial measure to elevate its security level in Taiwan, and that the building of an information security should focus on the comprehensiveness of its contents, procedures and implementation items, rather than on the documents only.

It is shown that the double-random-phase encoding encryption scheme is a linear symmetric block cipher cryptosystem and its linearity opens avenues of attacks. Under the known-plaintext attack, attacker can obtain the phase key (s) in the input plane using the typical phase retrieval algorithms and subsequently deduce the phase key (s) in the Fourier domain easily.

After receiving a client's image export request, the DICOM-NAS sent it to the DICOM server using the DICOM protocol. The server then provided DICOM images to the DICOM-NAS, which transferred them to the client, using HTTP. The DICOM-NAS plays an important role between the DICOM protocol and HTTP, and stores the requested images only temporarily. The DICOM server keeps all of the original DICOM images. If an unauthorized user attempts to access the DICOM-NAS, medical images cannot be accessed because images are not stored in the DICOM-NAS. Furthermore, the DICOM-NAS has features related to reporting and MPR. Therefore, the DICOM-NAS does not require a large storage capacity, but can greatly improve information security.","","CD-ROM; Computer Security; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Radiology Information Systems; Security Measures; Software; article; compact disk; computer program; computer security; hospital information system; information retrieval; Internet; medical record; organization and management"

Cisco has announced that it is to buy a video surveillance company - SyPixx Networks for $51 million. With the acquisition, it plans to connect video cameras to the IP network. The merging of the technology would potentially allow for a video to be more rapidly searched than if using analog. In addition, there will be no need for analog viewing central control room onsite, claims Cisco. Video could be speedily shared between different locations. The network giant reckons that the market will be worth $2 billion by 2007. The small acquisition of SyPixx, which has only 27 employees, could be sign of a bigger shift towards convergence for the industry as a whole. Cisco plans to get customers from retail, transport, banking, financial services and gaming markets. All of the big surveillance companies are moving towards IP. In addition, companies are starting to have the IT security and physical security functions both reporting into the same boss - the Chief Security Officer (CSO). Infosec is concerned with watching what we do virtually and physical security monitors what we do physically. A combined picture would be more powerful. Many solutions to information security problems have been stolen from the physical security approach. The idea of protecting the physical castle perimeter with walls is akin to the firewall protecting the soft vulnerable network. But the network no longer follows the fortress-like ideology. The opening up of networks for mobile access will need a rethink for guarding blurry boundaries. In the physical world, the boundaries are much clearer. Infosec may not be able to learn from physical secuity practices to fix that one. People have always been concerned with their physical security. But security of information is a more recent phenomenon. Both types of security have been traditionally disparate. But with phyiscal security moving towards electronic mechanisms - surely both can be converged? Dr Andy Jones discusses. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To obtain a stable interference pattern, a technique involving a photorefractive material is also proposed. The proposed scheme is composed of digital encryption and optoelectronic decryption. For the encryption process, a BPCGH that reconstructs the original image perfectly is designed, using a simulated annealing algorithm, and the resulting hologram is regarded as the image to be encrypted digitally. In addition, a reference image with key information is created using a random two-phase generator. The hologram is then encrypted using the reference image and the interference rule. For the decryption process, the interference intensity is obtained by interfering the reference image and the encrypted image, binarized with software, and then transformed into phase information. Finally, the original image is recovered by an inverse Fourier transformation of the binary-phase information. During this process, since the intensity information generated by the interference of the two images is very sensitive to external vibrations, a stable interference pattern is achieved using a self-pumped phase-conjugate mirror made of the photorefractive material BaTiO3. © 2006 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","","Algorithms; Computer generated holography; Computer simulation; Cryptography; Fourier transforms; Holograms; Light interference; Optoelectronic devices; Photorefractive materials; Security of data; Binary-phase computer-generated hologram (BPCGH); Optical information security; Optoelectronic decryption; Optical data processing"

The technique encodes the target image into two different phase only masks (POM) using a concept of free-space angular spectrum propagation. The two phase-masks are designed and located in any two arbitrary planes interrelated through the free space propagation domain in order to implement the optical encryption or authenticity verification. And both phase masks can serve as enciphered texts. Compared with previous methods, the proposed algorithm employs an improved searching strategy: modifying the phase-distributions of both masks synchronously as well as enlarging the searching space. And with such a scheme, we make use of a high performance floating-point Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to accomplish a design of multiple-locks and multiple-keys optical image encryption system. An evaluation of the system performance is made and it is shown that the algorithm results in much faster convergence and better image quality for the recovered image. And two masks and system parameters can be used to design keys for image encryption, therefore the decrypted image can be obtained only when all these keys are under authorization. This key-assignment strategy may reduce the risk of being intruded and show a high security level. These characters may introduce a high level security that makes the encrypted image more difficult to be decrypted by an unauthorized person.","Cascaded phase retrieval algorithm; DSP; Information optics; Information security; Optical encryption; Parallel hardware","Algorithms; Digital signal processing; Iterative methods; Optical systems; Security of data; Cascaded phase retrieval algorithm; DSP; Information optics; Optical encryption; Parallel hardware; Cryptography"

The security products can help make reasonably successful efforts to prevent intrusion by unauthorized entities. In case the security product should fail in preventing a hacker from intruding into the system, the security products help analyze the attack. The purchase of security products involves a continuing expense in personnel for managing the products, in training of the personnel and in developing processes for proper use of the security products. The products are also required to be continuously updated due to improvements in technology, the improved techniques of attack and the continuous change in the needs of an enterprise. However the difficult issue for every enterprise is the process of making a decision about the quantum of investment required to be made for security products. The decision-makers will like to apply the methods of ROI for determining the level of investments in security products. But the information system security projects cover a number of non-quantifiable factors not amenable to simplistic cost benefit or ROI analysis. Moreover security projects have to comply and deal with statutory issues and differ from case to case. We have conducted a survey to learn about the practices that the businesses use to decide about the investments in security products. The results, presented in the paper, show that none of the respondents use a scientific method for making such decisions. A Progressive ROI-based protocol for Budgeting Information Security (PROBIS) is presented in this paper. PROBIS helps decision-makers use a systematic method for deciding about the level of such an investment. The method becomes progressively better since it learns by comparing the results obtained against the decisions taken in the previous iteration.","Cost benefit and ROI analysis; Decision matrix to assist stakeholders; Information security expenditure; Non-quantifiable factors in IT security projects; Option price based ROI; Total cost of ownership of IT security","Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Information technology; Network protocols; Personnel training; Information security expenditure; Non-quantifiable factors; Total cost of ownership; Security of data"

The coherent ultrashort light pulse CDMA is a promising system for an optical local area network (LAN) due to its advantages of asynchronous transmission, high information security, multiple access capability, and optical processing. The nonlinear optical thresholder is based on frequency chirping induced by self-phase modulation (SPM) in optical fiber, and discriminates an ultrashort pulse from multiple access interference (MAI) with picosecond duration. The numerical results show that the thermal noise caused in a photodetector dominates the bit error rate (BER). BER decreases as the fiber length in the nonlinear thresholder and the photocurrent difference in the photodetector increase. Using the nonlinear optical thresholder allows for the response time of the photodetector to be at least 100 times the duration of the ultrashort pulses. We also show that the optimum cut-off frequency at the nonlinear thresholder to achieve the minimum BER increases with fiber length, the total number of users, and the load resistance in the photodetector.

The PC and its back-end servers remain important in a pervasive system, and the technology could involve new ways of interfacing with a PC and/or various types of gateways to back-end servers. In this research, cellular phone was used as the pervasive device for accessing an Internet application prototype, a multimodal Web system (MWS), through voice user interface technology. This paper describes how MWS was developed to provide a secure interactive voice channel using an Apache Web server, a voice server, and Java technology. Securing multimodal applications proves more challenging than securing traditional Internet applications. Various standards have been developed within a context of Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) platform to secure multimodal and wireless applications.

Used without direction or by not following privacy by design principles results in ineffective privacy protection. What is required is a complete solution, that gives due consideration to all models, and is easily integrated in to all types of environments.

If necessary, any t members can provide their secret shares together and recover the secret by using a publicly specified algorithm. Multisecret sharing schemes allow a dealer to share multiple secrets among a group of participants securely and efficiently. In recent, Shi proposed an efficient multisecret sharing authenticating scheme. In his scheme, not only the shares held by the participants are reusable, but also the shares distributed by the dealer and the shadow shares provided by the participants are verifiable. This paper analyzes the security of Shi's scheme. It first points out a design error in his scheme, and then demonstrates an attack to show that both of his share-authenticating and shadow-key-authenticating methods are insecure. Specifically, using the attacks, a dishonest dealer can distribute false shares to participants, and malicious participants can easily forge false shadow shares such that the authenticating equality is satisfied. The result is that honest participants will be cheated and misled to believe that the recovered secret is correct. In addition, improvements are provided to avoid the identified design error and attacks.","Cryptography; Information security; Multisecret sharing; Secret sharing","Cryptography; Security of data; Information security; Multisecret sharing; Publicly specified algorithm; Secret sharing; Shadow key authenticating methods; Share authenticating; Public key cryptography"

The study assessed whether firms approach the budgeting process for information security expenditures in a rational economic manner-based on cost-benefit analysis. Emperical evidence shows that cost-benefit analysis is a sound basis for budgeting information security expenditure. The cost associated with information security activities relate to a host of items, including hardware, software and personnel. A rational economic process used for budgeting capital investments applies cost-benefit analysis using the net present value (NPV). The use of NPV approach to derive an optimal expenditure level can be regarded as an ideal economic approach for budgeting information security. The ability to estimate benefits is a key factor driving the use of NPV analysis in decisions concerning the level of expenditures on information security.","","Budget control; Computer software; Costs; Decision making; Investments; Personnel; Cost-benefit analysis; Net present value (NPV); Security of data"

Design/methodology/approach Risk management involves a number of human activities which are based on the way the various stakeholders perceive risk associated with IS assets. Cultural theory claims that risk perception within social groups and structures is predictable according to group and individual worldviews; therefore this paper examines the implications of cultural theory on IS risk management as a means for security experts to manage stakeholders perceptions. Findings A basic theoretical element of cultural theory is the grid/group typology, where four cultural groups with differentiating worldviews are identified. This paper presents how these worldviews affect the process of IS risk management and suggests key issues to be considered in developing strategies of risk management according to the different perceptions cultural groups have. Research limitations/implications The findings of this research are based on theoretical analysis and are not supported by relevant empirical research. Further research is also required for incorporating the identified key issues into information security management systems (ISMS). Originality/value IS security management overlooks stakeholders' risk perception; for example, there is no scheme developed to understand and manage the perception of IS stakeholders. This paper proposes some key issues that should be taken into account when developing strategies for addressing the issue of understanding and managing the perception of IS stakeholders. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Data security; Information control; National cultures; Risk management","Human engineering; Information management; Risk perception; Security of data; Social sciences; Cultural theory; Information control; Information security managment systems (ISMS); National cultures; Stakeholders perceptions; Risk management"

Therefore, how to protect information security and avoid intrusions is an important issue. In order to prevent the behavior of intrusion to Internet, many software tools or methods such as intrusion detection systems have been proposing. However, in the past twenty years, the operation of intrusion detection systems still cannot be efficient. The reason is that existing intrusion detection systems are still with low detection rate and high false positive. Especially, high false positive lets system managers refuse to use intrusion detection systems. Therefore, in order to increase the effectiveness of intrusion detection and reduce the false positive, we propose a hierarchical clustering algorithm for intrusion detection. Our proposed method is the highly accurate hierarchical clustering algorithm, which is suitable for clustering network packets. The proposed clustering algorithm can accurately generate normal and abnormal clusters, and is more efficient and accurate than existing clustering methods.","Clustering Algorithm; Detection Rate; False Positive; Intrusion Detection System","Algorithms; Computer privacy; Data privacy; Internet; Managers; Packet networks; Security of data; Clustering Algorithms; Detection Rate; False Positive; Intrusion Detection System; Computer crime"

In many cases security in universities is approached through the addition of tactical solutions. Often systems security is added on as a final consideration instead of during early design stages. This approach can be incomprehensive and inefficient. Although this approach can provide limited security, there is no guarantee that business requirements for security are incorporated and integrated effectively. This situation is partly due to security management in Australian universities being challenged by the complexity of both university culture and diverse operating environments. In many circumstances the champion for security in universities tends to be relegated to an officer in the IT department, hidden away from the business itself. Often this person with operational responsibility for security will have a detailed understanding of what should occur in security, but faces difficulties in determining exactly how to go about achieving this on an enterprise level. In order to assist in securing university IT systems and thereby improving e-business security, this research proposes a security practitioner’s management model. This model is aimed at facilitating the transition of security knowledge into actual implementation across the enterprise, with an end goal of an improved culture of compliance towards security practices in the university sector. This work is of significant value as it results from a study into specific security management issues facing Australian universities. This study highlights that future research would be well-placed to focus on benchmarking information security management within the university sector. © 2006 Universidad de Talca-Chile.","Australian universities; Culture of compliance; E-security; Information model; Security framework; Security management",""

This report therefore focuses on analyzing the work reported in the past 20 SEC conferences, the flagship conference series of the IFIP Technical Committee 11 (TC-11). The study indicates that the focus of papers increased over time and that the output of papers became more technical. Certain topics such as auditing and business continuity have largely disappeared as a topic. The study confirmed an expected increase in the prominence of papers dealing with network related research.

Responses from 284 Chinese manufacturing firms were used to test the study's hypotheses. Results revealed that the frequency, diversity and formality of Internet communication played an important role in determining the level of purchasing performance. Additionally, formality was critical to managing information flows over the Internet and preventing potential Internet information security risks. Further, results indicated that two factors, perceived Internet security risks and norms of Internet information sharing, significantly influenced Internet communication behaviors.

Researchers from South African Universities showed shortcomings in information integrity and made recommendations to address them. The authors believe that some of the ""extreme measures"" used to ensure the integrity of financial matters should be applied to information security. According to the research, only 1/9 of processes to achieve integrity assurance are fully implemented. Three quarters are implemented in an ad-hoc manner or normally implemented, while 1/9 are never put in place. It was found that security reports are ""never"" distributed to business units and CEOs don't sign-off reports. The study also discovered that transactions were recorded and stored in an ad-hoc manner. In response to the identified shortcomings, authors recommend all network activities should be captured and stored, while CEOs should sign-off high-level IT security reports. This paper draws an analogy between the models that provide financial integrity and network information integrity. A comparative study between the financial integrity assurance model and the information integrity assurance model was conducted to identify possible information integrity assurance shortcomings or 'missing links'. Recommendations are made towards improving the generic information integrity assurance scenario to address the identified shortcomings. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of this information is private, and individuals are simultaneously becoming more aware of the value of the information and how the loss of control over this information impacts their personal privacy. As a partial solution to these concerns, this paper presents a mechanism that serves two purposes. The first enables the use of private, numerical data in the answering of queries while simultaneously providing a security feature that protects the data owners from a loss of privacy that could result from an unauthorized access. The second develops a compensation model for the use of the data that allows individuals to dynamically redefine their security requirements. The compensation model is built on the information-security mechanism to create the foundation of a market for private information. This paper illustrates how compensation models like the one presented here could be used in a self-regulating market for private information. Additionally, the compensation component of an intermediated market for private information is developed and extensively analyzed.

Their non-functional nature imposes complex constraints on the emergent behavior of software-intensive systems, making them hard to understand, predict, and control. To address these issues, we present novel techniques from software requirements engineering and knowledge engineering for systematically extracting, modeling, and analyzing security requirements and related concepts from multiple C&A-enforced regulatory documents.

Dario Forte and Richard Power grill the founder of the New York City FBI computer crime squad, Ed Stroz about corporate investigations. Ed Stroz believes that computer expertise is fundamental to any investigation. He said that clients need investigators who will know if computerized evidence exists, where it is and how it must be preserved. He believes that the information age has made investigation easier, but only if you have the expertise to do it properly. A computer evidence trail can demonstrate more clearly someone's actions, than surveillance ever could, he says. Often a private investigator with base-line computer expertise is needed to work hand-in-hand with a computer forensics expert. You need to know basics like how packet-switched networks operate, how servers and blackberries communicate, how printers store data and so on. He says that sometimes executives expect staff from the IT department to be computer forensic examiners. A big problem is the delayed reaction in getting the right expertise. If a computer forensic examiner is brought in too late, then sometimes the data needed for evidence has been overwritten, warns Stroz who is now a managing partner of Stroz Friedberg. He also recommends that it is important to have lawyers advising early on. Getting ahead of the curve on cyber forensics, e-discovery and other challenging aspects of corporate investigations into malfeasance (whether perpetrated by insiders or outsiders) is one of the most vital tasks that confronts 21st Century information security professionals.

A challenging task is how to maintain information security at a high level for multiple-destination video applications with the huge volume of data and dynamic property of clients. This paper proposes a novel Content-Aware Secure Multicast (CASM) protocol for video distribution that seamlessly integrates three important modules: 1) a scalable light-weight algorithm for group key management; 2) a content-aware key embedding algorithm that can make video quality distortion imperceptible and is reliable for clients to detect embedded keys; and 3) a smart two-level video encryption algorithm that can selectively encrypt a small set of video data only, and yet ensure the video as well as the embedded keys unrecognizable without a genuine key. The implementation of the CASM protocol is independent of the underlying multicast mechanism and is fully compatible with existing coding standards. Performance evaluation studies built upon a CASM prototype have demonstrated that CASM is highly robust and scalable in dynamic multicast environments. Moreover, it ensures secure distribution of key and video data with minimized communication and computation overheads. The proposed content-aware key embedding and encryption algorithms are fast enough to support real-time video multicasting. © 2006 IEEE.","Content-awareness; Key management; Secure multicast; Selective encryption","Algorithms; Communication; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Network protocols; Research; Security of data; Content-Aware Secure Multicast (CASM); Content-awareness; Key management; Secure multicast; Selective encryption; Video distribution; Multicasting"

We experimentally analyze 95 purchasing professionals' decisions to recommend using a B2B exchange. The experiment is a 2 × 2 between-participants design varying the scope and timing of an assurance report with an additional control condition of no assurance. The results suggest that purchasing professionals are more likely to recommend use of the exchange when general assurance over the reliability of the exchange's system is present than when specific assurance over the reliability of transaction information is present. Purchasing professionals are also more likely to recommend using the exchange when the assurance report is continuous than when it is static, issued at a point in time. However, the results also suggest that participants are less likely to recommend using the exchange when specific information assurance or static assurance is present than when assurance is not present at all. Further, other factors besides assurance, especially trust in the trading partner and propensity to trust, have a stronger influence on the decision to use a B2B exchange than the presence of either continuous or systems assurance. Potential implications for practice include redesigning existing assurance services to provide continuous assurance, de-emphasizing formalized reports and considering assurance services over other factors, such as web site design. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Questions such as ""Is she really who she claims to be?,"" ""Is this person authorized to use this facility?,"" or ""Is he in the watchlist posted by the government?"" are routinely being posed in a variety of scenarios ranging from issuing a driver's license to gaining entry into a country. The need for reliable user authentication techniques has increased in the wake of heightened concerns about security and rapid advancements in networking, communication, and mobility. Biometrics, described as the science of recognizing an individual based on his or her physical or behavioral traits, is beginning to gain acceptance as a legitimate method for determining an individual's identity. Biometric systems have now been deployed in various commercial, civilian, and forensic applications as a means of establishing identity. In this paper, we provide an overview of biometrics and discuss some of the salient research issues that need to be addressed for making biometric technology an effective tool for providing information security. The primary contribution of this overview includes: 1) examining applications where biometrics can solve issues pertaining to information security; 2) enumerating the fundamental challenges encountered by biometric systems in real-world applications; and 3) discussing solutions to address the problems of scalability and security in large-scale authentication systems. © 2006 IEEE.","Biometrics; Cryptosystems; Digital rights management; Grand challenge; Information security; Multibiometrics","Cryptography; Driver licensing; Pattern recognition; Social aspects; Telecommunication networks; Biometric systems; Digital rights management; Grand challenge; Multibiometrics; Security of data"

Some commentators including Bruce Schneier have declared that privacy is a luxury of a bygone era. Location-based services can pin down the whereabouts of your phone, PDA and car. With these new upcoming technologies, the need for privacy controls is increasing. Privacy has become an information security problem. Privacy means different things to different people so is difficult to specify in legislation. Confusion about data protection can lead to privacy breaches or the storage of unnecessary data. Research has stated that users should be able to control seven aspects of their private information knows as the seven Cs. They include the ability to authorise the use of personal information and the ability to indicate privacy preferences. Researchers Gunter at al advocate the use of Digital Rights Management to protect privacy. Privacy issues can be divided into collection, access and use. Breaches can occur during data collection, processing and dissemination. DRM would allow data owners to control the dissemination of their information. Violating privacy includes: breach of confidentiality, disclosure, secondary use, insecurity. If we can successfully codify privacy in a manner consistent with legal interpretations we may also be able to codify it to support software development and systems implementations that handle personal data. Robert Rowlingson surveys some privacy research. Privacy is a broad subject, encompassing a wide range of activities, and subtle legal issues. It is a much more complex concept than commonly recognized. This paper considers some recent publications which are helping to clarify our understanding of privacy. The work presented sheds light on how to harmonise real-world applications that use personal data, with legal structures which are the ultimate protectors of privacy. The research described could eventually help businesses, and developers of IT systems which increasingly embody privacy risks, to reflect privacy issues and provide appropriate information security counter-measures. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Routinely collected primary care data has underpinned research that has helped define primary care as a specialty. In the early years of the discipline, data were collected manually, but digital data collection now makes large volumes of data readily available. Primary care informatics is emerging as an academic discipline for the scientific study of how to harness these data. This paper reviews how data are stored in primary care computer systems; current use of large primary care research databases; and, the opportunities and challenges for using routinely collected primary care data in research. Opportunities. (1) Growing volumes of routinely recorded data. (2) Improving data quality. (3) Technological progress enabling large datasets to be processed. (4) The potential to link clinical data in family practice with other data including genetic databases. (5) An established body of know-how within the international health informatics community. Challenges. (1) Research methods for working with large primary care datasets are limited. (2) How to infer meaning from data. (3) Pace of change in medicine and technology. (4) Integrating systems where there is often no reliable unique identifier and between health (person-based records) and social care (care-based records - e.g. child protection). (5) Achieving appropriate levels of information security, confidentiality, and privacy. Conclusion. Routinely collected primary care computer data, aggregated into large databases, is used for audit, quality improvement, health service planning, epidemiological study and research. However, gaps exist in the literature about how to find relevant data, select appropriate research methods and ensure that the correct inferences are drawn. © 2006 Oxford University Press.","Continuity of patient care; Family practice; Health services accessibility; Models; Organizational","Biomedical Research; Data Collection; Databases; Humans; Medical Informatics; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; National Health Programs; Netherlands; Primary Health Care; computer system; confidentiality; controlled study; general practice; health care quality; human; information processing; medical information system; medical record; medical research; primary medical care; quality control; review; standardization; systematized nomenclature of medicine; disease classification; general practice; medical information system; nomenclature; social care; United Kingdom; world health organization"

Security analysts forecasts of corporate earnings are often seen as a potential driver for prices and so have also been investigated for evidence of over-reaction. While excessive volatility in analysts forecasts is reported in DeBondt and Thaler (1990) it has been suggested that analysts reactions may differ across different information types (Abarbanell and Bernard, 1992). Easterwood and Nutt (1999) hypothesize that analysts may under-react to negative information but over-react to positive information. This research examines analysts reactions to one major piece of negative information or 'bad news, namely the impact of 9/11 on international airlines.

Several industry groups are therefore taking steps to better coordinate and improve information security across sectors. Also, various different types of public-private partnerships are developing, where cyber incident information is shared across institutions. This cooperation may improve the understanding of various types of cyber incidents, their severity, and impact on various types of targets. Research has shown that different types of attackers may be distinguished in terms of sophistication, skill level, attacking style, and objective of attack. It may further be proposed that different sectors experience different types of attacks. Attack characteristics and information about the modus operandi of criminal offenders have been used to learn more about the attacker and the motive of an attack. This information may also be used to distinguish between cyber attacks towards different types of targets. The current study focuses on reported cyber intrusions by the commercial and government sectors. The reported data come from CERT®Coordination Center (CERT/CC), which has categorized the aspects of cyber intrusions in the current study. The aspects analyzed are: 'Method of Operation (MO)' which refers to the methods used by perpetrator to carry out an attack; 'Impact' which refers to the effect of the attack; 'Source' which refers to the source of the attack, and 'Target' which refers to the victim of the attack. The current study uses 839 cases of cyber attacks towards the commercial sector and 558 cases towards the government sector. The 23 variables from the four different cyber intrusion aspects; MO, impact, source sector and target sector, were analyzed using multidimensional scaling (MDS), which is a technique that has often been used when profiling traditional types of crimes. The analysis gave a Guttman-Lingoes' coefficient of alienation of 0.19 with 42 iterations in a 3-dimensional solution. It was shown that the commercial and government sectors experience different types of attacks, with different types of impact, stemming from different sources.

The new model is named MtACL (information flow control model for multithreaded object-oriented applications based on access control lists). The multithreaded problems solved by MtACL include the shared memory problem, the non-interference problem, and the combination leakage problem. This paper presents MtACL and proves that the model solves the multithreaded problems. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Many aspects are being investigated, such as agents' attitudes towards internet applications, the current state of internet use, the relative maturity of the web sites, and internet marketing by Greek tourist agencies. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was conducted. Greek Travel Pages (GTP), notified travel agents via e-mail sent about the online questionnaire web site. Travel agents willing to participate visited a tailor made web site replied to the questionnaire and the data were recorded to a database. A total of 117 questionnaires were answered. The questionnaire used included five sections and questions were adopted from previous researches. Findings - Facilitation of global marketing and completion of online services are the most important reasons for using internet practices according to tourism agents. Travel agencies generally do not use internet practices effectively as a relatively small number of transactions are completed on line. The web pages are merely used as another means to exhibit their static information. Security difficulties and the need for social interaction are the main barriers to marketing over the internet Research limitations/implications - This is an exploratory study addressed to agents on-line. Further research and studies are needed by a broader range of travel agencies Practical implications - Provides suggestions for good practices to tourism agents along with an understanding of their attitudes on internet use Originality/value - Enables travel agents to recognize the pros and cons of using internet and to make technology an essential part of the company. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Greece; Internet; Internet marketing; Tourism; Travel",""

While regular phishing attacks are easily thwarted, designing the attack to include user context information could potentially increase the user's vulnerability. To prevent this, phishing education needs to be considered. In this paper we provide an overview of phishing education, focusing on context aware attacks and introduce a new strategy for educating users by combining phishing IQ tests and class discussions. The technique encompasses displaying both legitimate and fraudulent e-mails to users and having them identify the phishing attempts from the authentic e-mails. Proper implementation of this system helps teach users what to look for in e-mails, and how to protect their confidential information from being caught in the nets of phishers. The strategy was applied in Introduction to Computing courses as part of the computer security component. Class assessment indicates an increased level of awareness and better recognition of attacks.

Identifying security threats and implementing countermeasures to stop them would eliminate loss from attacks in organizations. Providing security training for all employees in an organization will reduce the number of major security breaches. One way to increase the management awareness and interest in the information security discussion is to demonstrate the financial impact of security breaches.

In this paper we are presenting a new fundamental concept that allows implement a security policy by a systematic and efficient key distribution procedure. Specifically, we extend the polynomial Shamir key splitting. According to this, a global key is split into n parts, any k of which can re-construct the original key. In this paper we present a method that instead of having ""any k parts"" be able to re-construct the original key, the latter can only be reconstructed if keys are combined as any access control policy describes. This leads into an easily deployable key generation procedure that results a single key per entity that ""knows"" its role in the specific access control policy from which it was derived. The system is considered efficient as it may be used to avoid expensive PKI operations or pairwise key distributions as well as provides superior security due to its distributed nature, the fact that the key is tightly coupled to the policy, and that policy change may be implemented easier and faster.","Authentication; Information assurance; Policy; Security; Shared key","Computer networks; Computer system recovery; Distributed computer systems; Information dissemination; Information management; Real time systems; Access control; Authentication; Information assurance; Shared keys; Security of data"

In given scheme, wavelet coefficients corresponding to the same spatial locations are grouped together. Two such groups, selected at random, constitute a supertree. Some of these supertrees are quantized to embed the watermark information in the image. In the process of cryptanalysis we first identify the groups which are quantized during the watermark insertion process. Then we select the non-quantized groups and quantize them too, to remove the watermark. Experimental results show that the watermark is completely removed by this attack. The cryptanalysis falls under the cipher text only jamming attack which requires only a single watermarked copy. Further, we suitably modify the WTQ scheme to make it robust against such cryptanalytic attacks. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Cryptanalysis; Digital watermarking; Information security; Multimedia systems; Wavelet transform","Cryptography; Jamming; Multimedia systems; Robustness (control systems); Security of data; Spatial variables measurement; Wavelet transforms; Cryptanalysis; Watermark insertion process; Wavelet tree quantization; Digital watermarking"

This new approach incorporates a teaching hospital model originally developed for medical training. In this model, information security problems from industry and government are solved and abstracted into living-cases used for training and education of university students and public-sector employees. Such a model helps ensure that the curriculum stays current even as the field of information assurance continues to evolve. Solving industry problems hones research skills, while exposing students to living cases helps build context for concepts in information assurance. The success of this approach is contingent upon strong partnerships with government and private organizations that have real security issues as well as an active research program in information security that involves faculty and students. This article presents an implementation of this approach at CIFA. Development of the curriculum, observations gleaned through dissemination of the curriculum, and the infrastructure developed to support this concept are discussed.

Among them, Hippocratic databases offer mechanisms for enforcing privacy rules in database systems for inter-organizational business processes (also known as virtual organizations). This paper extends these mechanisms to allow for hierarchical purposes, distributed authorizations and minimal disclosure supporting the business processes of virtual organizations that want to offer their clients a number of ways to fulfill a service. Specifically, we use a goal-oriented approach to analyze privacy policies of the enterprises involved in a business process. On the basis of the purpose hierarchy derived through a goal refinement process, we provide algorithms for determining the minimum set of authorizations needed to achieve a service. This allows us to automatically derive access control policies for an inter-organizational business process from the collection of privacy policies associated with different participating enterprises. By using effective on-line algorithms, the derivation of such minimal information can also be done on-the-fly by the customer wishing to access a service. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Access control; Delegation; Information security; Minimal disclosure; Privacy protection; Private data management; Virtual organizations",""

Two recent legal measures namely the National Do Not Call List (DNCL) and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM), both designed to enforce the freedom of silence, have been found to have a relatively low efficacy. As such, a number of technologies have been developed to protect the freedom of silence. Technology-based solutions are the most effective means to limit the inflow of information rather than legally shaped. These technologies are not as slow-moving as the legal framework but are quick and adaptive reactions to other technologies.

As individual methods and small systems, these algorithms have shown great potential for application to many commercial and military needs in the areas of information assurance, communication and protection. However, one largely ignored aspect of data embedding development has been the systems perspective - how these technologies will contribute and interact with other critical technologies in the development of large scale system solutions. As the military moves toward network-centric, fully integrated systems it is expected that digital data embedding technologies will play crucial roles. Data embedding provides a range of enabling technologies which can help achieve data-centric, as opposed to application-centric, information assurance. The current state of the art in digital data embedding techniques and how they have matured in recent years will be addressed. The technology will be traced through the development of standalone algorithms to the small, integrated systems that are appearing today. Applications involving digital data embedding technologies integrated with other technologies, such as biometrics and cryptography, provide the first glimpses into the systems of the future. A projection as to how these integrated systems will evolve into the net-centric, system-of-systems will be presented. This challenge will require maintaining a strong connection from research through development and use, to ensure future architectures and the needs of users are addressed. While many open questions remain, the discussion will provide perspective and illustrate some challenges to be investigated as the field moves forward.","","Algorithms; Cryptography; Embedded systems; Government data processing; Information analysis; Large scale systems; Problem solving; Watermarking; Data embedding development; Digital data embedding; Digital data forensics; Integrated systems; Security of data"

Therefore, to avoid these weaknesses, while providing the same functions, we add confidentiality to the original group signature by distributing a shared secret among group members through an efficient group key agreement. However, in case of just combining a group signature and a group key agreement, if an attacker who does not belong to the group acquires a valid group signature, it is still possible for him to impersonate a valid group member and delegate the group. Thus, to avoid this possibility, the proposed scheme confirms whether or not the sender is equal to the signer by including a session key encryption in the signed message. In addition, we analyze the security of the proposed scheme and apply it to an anonymous statistical survey of attributes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

While responsibility for security rests largely with the national activities, the EU has also started planning a research area ""Space and security"" as a part of the 7th Framework Programme. As the justification for this research area it has been presented that ""Technology alone can not assure security, but security can not be assured without the support of technology."" Furthermore, the justification highlights that security and military research are becoming ever closer. The old separation between civil and military research is decreasing, because it has been noticed that both areas are nowadays utilising the same knowledge. In Finland, there is already now noteworthy entrepreneurship related to security. Although some of the companies are currently only operating in Finland, others are already international leaders in their area. The importance of the security area is increasing and remarkable potential for new growth business areas can already be identified. This however also requires an increase in research efforts. VTT has a broad range of security research ongoing in many technology areas. The main areas have been concentrating on public safety and security, but VTT is participating also in several research projects related to the defence technology. For identifying and defining in more detail the expertise and research goals, the Security research roadmap was developed. The roadmap identified three particularly significant areas related to security. The assurance of critical infrastructure emphasises the protection of energy networks, information networks, water supply, traffic and transport, and obviously also the citizens. For assuring the activities of entrepreneurship, significant areas include the security of production and services, the security of sites and assets, and information security for embedded systems. The most important security products and technologies needed are, for example, management of total security, detection, identification, localisation and communication, protection of information networks and systems, and physical protection.

Several encryption methods have been proposed in the literature, which includes optical double randomphase encryption, polarization encoding, encryption and verification using a multiplexed minimum average correlation energy phase-encrypted filter. All these reports employed a pseudo-random number for the code. But as such numbers are not uncorrelated, the security is not guaranteed because a wrong code may also extract some of the features of the coded information. The objective of the paper is to develop an optical security system employing orthogonal code for protection of personal identification information. As the orthogonal codes have zero or minimum cross-correlation depending on the offset between the codes, a wrong code can not decrypt any information. Here a simple encryption technique is proposed in spatial domain, where the input images are first spread in one dimension using an optical lens and then multiplied by the respective code. Finally, the individual encrypted images are superimposed on a common spatial domain. The individual images can then be decrypted by correlating the received signal with the respective address code. Computer simulation results show that any information containing binary characters can be encrypted and then decrypted successfully. The encrypted images are found to be secure, because no unwanted reproduction is possible without having the appropriate code. The technique also offers an efficient use of the storage or transmission capacity. Therefore, the proposed optical encryption technique can be applied to securing personal identification or similar information.","Optical encryption and decryption; Optical information processing; Optical security; Orthogonal coding","Computer simulation; Information analysis; Light polarization; Optical data processing; Optical sensors; Random number generation; Security systems; Signal systems; Optical encryption and decryption; Optical security; Orthogonal coding; Personal identification information; Transmission capacity; Cryptography"

In the past, companies chose between prosecution and fixing a breach. But fixing a compromise often meant destroying evidence. In America, 23 states have data notification laws regarding security breaches, and another 12 have legislation on the way. Different member states in Europe have different approaches to notifying customers. Notification of affected customers should be another part of incident response. If an organization resides in a member state that is not subject to a specific notification law, they should adhere to common law liability - taking each incident on a case-by-case basis. But is it always in the corporation's interest to notify customers of a breach as the hostile publicity can make a dent in the share price and as a result adversely affect shareholders? Also, if customers are being informed of every breach, trust may decrease in the company. Data theft has become a fact of everyday life. Businesses, non-profits, and government agencies have all experienced serious information security breaches that have put at risk the data of millions of individuals. Some attacks have been intricate electronic exploits targeting specific databases, while others have been simple thefts of hardware containing sensitive data. Attackers themselves range from disgruntled teens experimenting with hacking tools to sophisticated organized crime rings that seek out financial institutions, health care organizations, data aggregators, and government agencies, all of which process and store highly confidential information in aggregate. Such data represents a gold mine for ID thieves. In many cases, consumers may choose whether or not to disclose personal information to these organizations - they may decide against doing business with certain companies if it involves the disclosure of personal information. They do not always have that luxury, however, when dealing with government agencies. In fact, individuals may or may not know that a government entity is in possession of their personal information; they have no input into its protection, and often little recourse after a security incident. Given that, the question now becomes, when should an organization notify consumers of a breach in its data security? © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Insights that are fashioned from closely-held data stores are likely to possess a high degree of reliability. The degree of information assurance comes into question, however, when external databases are accessed, combined and analyzed to form new perspectives. ISO/IEC 17799, Information technology-Security techniques-Code of practice for information security management, can be used to establish a higher level of information assurance among disparate entities using data mining in the defense, homeland security, commercial and other civilian/commercial domains. Organizations that meet ISO/IEC information security standards have identified and assessed risks, threats and vulnerabilities and have taken significant proactive steps to meet their unique security requirements. The ISO standards address twelve domains: risk assessment and treatment, security policy, organization of information security, asset management, human resources security, physical and environmental security, communications and operations management, access control, information systems acquisition, development and maintenance, information security incident management and business continuity management and compliance. Analysts can be relatively confident that if organizations are ISO 17799 compliant, a high degree of information assurance is likely to be a characteristic of the data sets being used. The reverse may be true. Extracting, fusing and drawing conclusions based upon databases with a low degree of information assurance may be wrought with all of the hazards that come from knowingly using bad data to make decisions. Using ISO/IEC 17799 as a baseline for information assurance can help mitigate these risks.","","Codes (standards); Data acquisition; Information management; Quality assurance; Security of data; Standardization; Data sources; Homeland security; Information assurance; Security management; Data mining"

Design/methodology/approach - Various information security surveys indicate that misuse by legitimate (insider) users has serious implications for the health of IT environments. A brief discussion of survey data and insider threat concepts is followed by an overviewof existing research efforts to mitigate this particular problem. None of the existing insider threat mitigation frameworks provide facilities for systematically describing the elements of misuse incidents, and thus all threat mitigation frameworks could benefit from the existence of a domain specific language for describing legitimate user actions. Findings - The paper presents a language development methodology which centres upon ways to abstract the insider threat domain and approaches to encode the abstracted information into language semantics. The language construction methodology is based upon observed information security survey trends and the study of existing insider threat and intrusion specification frameworks. Originality/value - This paper summarizes the picture of the insider threat in IT infrastructures and provides a useful reference for insider threat modeling researchers by indicating ways to abstract insider threats.","Data security; Information systems","Computer hardware description languages; Information technology; Semantics; Information security survay; Information systems; Language semantics; Mitigation frameworks; Security of data"

Many advances are due to the introduction of new technologies that not only bring new opportunities but also can have a profound effect on human behaviours. Technology is always advancing steadily, but every so often there is evidence of a momentous leap forward. In fact this report is produced courtesy of a laptop, mobile phone and the Internet, i.e. powerful technologies that we regard as essential to modern life yet would have been considered science fiction only 30 years earlier. This ""information technology"" has empowered individuals like never before, however, it is indiscriminate and works just as well for those with good or bad intentions. Therefore, to safeguard the good from the bad, the field of Information Security was born. Information Security has been steadily evolving and has developed special technologies of its own to use in the fight to keep systems, information and individuals secure. One of these is the Smart Card (SC) that has proven itself to be tamper-resistant security token that can be deployed to end-users to secure systems and protocols. The cards have been very successful and have evolved steadily to a surprising level of sophistication; however, we may be just at the point when the smart card makes a momentous and assumption-shaking leap forward. The reason for this view arises because Smart Card vendors now have pre-production prototypes of High Density Smart Cards (that we will refer to as HDSCs) aimed initially at the mobile communications market, which could change our perception of security tokens and the associated system architectures and processes. This paper explores this possibility by first reviewing the current roles and limitations of conventional smart cards and then comparing with the HDSC. Finally, some thoughts will be presented on the business reality of introducing HDSCs. © 2006.","","Computer architecture; Computer science; Information technology; Internet; Mobile telecommunication systems; Security of data; Security systems; High Density Smart Cards; Mobile communications; System architectures; Tamper-resistant security; Smart cards"

Examining two illustrative case studies from major federal agencies, the author identifies serious structural flaws in the design and implementation of the relevant legislation. Through the lens of bureaucratic and organizational theory, he explains why the legislation is not well-suited to achieving comprehensive information security - and why the federal government's track record in this area has been so poor.

However, the dependence of the system on data exchange and the openness of interfaces raise information security concerns. This chapter analyzes security vulnerabilities and threats in distributed control systems and proposes security protocols to mitigate the threats. The feasibility of employing the proposed protocols was validated through experimental implementations and measurements showing that the overhead introduced by cryptographic algorithms is comparable to other typical functions of embedded controllers. The results demonstrated that state-of-the-art embedded devices are capable of performing complex encryption functions in a time period that is comparable to other common network functions. © 2006 Copyright © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Key findings indicate that SME owners lack sufficient awareness of the importance of information security and must be persuaded to invest in it, with an initial risk analysis potentially useful for this purpose. Other findings suggest that management commitment and leadership are important influences when reinforced by formal policies and procedures and a range of formal and informal security awareness activities.

Recently, external auditors are under pressure to provide realtime assurance. Movement of this kind has complicated as to when and how to grant the access privileges to external auditors. In addition, when there is a high degree of collaborative relationship among organizations, the collaborators need to establish policies of auditors' access controls and set up conditions and constraints for security and confidentiality reasons. Since auditors among the collaborators have different seniority, the access privileges should be granted based on the seniority of the auditors in the collaborative team members. In contrast, the growth of Web service becomes a new paradigm to provide collaborative auditing service via Web. The access control issue is a crucial issue for the future collaboration. In this study, we propose a rolebased Chinese Wall model, which organizes the corporate data into four different types of control groups with different access control policies, for the auditors to access the data among collaborating enterprises. Using the vendor-managed inventories (VMI) example, the study discusses how auditing tasks can be performed under the proposed access control environment. To ensure the functionality of the proposed framework, the study uses Oracle software to demonstrate the feasibility of the model. © 2007, Idea Group Inc.","",""

The study resulted in a number of value areas related to university general issues (UGV) and ISS issues important within an academic environment. The UGV and the ISS values can be further analyzed and transformed into ISS objectives suitable within an academic environment. Furthermore the identified values should be considered when ISS strategy to achieve those objectives is decided.

We describe a method to obtain four-factor authentication. The authenticators are: two different primary images containing signatures or biometric information and two different white random sequences that act as key codes. So far, optical security techniques deal with a single primary image (an object, a signature, or a biometric signal), not combined primary images. Our method involves double random-phase encoding, fully phase-based encryption and a combined nonlinear JTC and a classical 4f-correlator for simultaneous recognition and authentication of multiple images. There is no a priori constraint about the type of primary images to encode. Two reference images, double-phase encoded and encrypted in an ID tag (or card) are compared with the actual input images obtained in situ from the person whose authentication is wanted. The two key phase codes are known by the authentication processor. The complex-amplitude encoded image of the ID tag has a dim appearance that does not reveal the content of any primary reference image nor the key codes. The encoded image function fullfils the general requirements of invisible content, extreme difficulty in counterfeiting and real-time automatic verification. The possibility of introducing nonlinearities in the Fourier plane of the optical processor will be exploited to improve the system performance. This optical technique is attractive for high-security purposes that require multifactor reliable authentication.","Fourier optics; Information security; Nonlinear correlation; Optical encryption; Optical recognition; Optical signal processing","Codes (symbols); Copyrights; Fourier optics; Image processing; Optical systems; Random processes; Real time systems; Security of data; Nonlinear correlation; Optical encryption; Optical recognition; Optical signal processing; Cryptography"

To achieve business transformation within the UK Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector, BT is taking a strategic approach to outsourcing: this has resulted in a rapid and substantial increase in the outsourcing and offshoring of ICT development, maintenance and support contracts. Each and every outsourcing decision could have major security, legal, regulatory and contractual impacts. It is generally recognised that risks are likely to be compounded when outsourcing to companies based in countries that have different political, economic and cultural environments and, subsequently, that security assessments must be augmented to address this. However, difficulties can occur with the ongoing ownership of responsibilities for outsourced information and its processing, particularly when a number of vendors may be involved with the same product or service. Outsourcing security risks are becoming increasingly dynamic and complex, have major business implications and require both tactical and strategic responses. This presents many challenges for corporate security functions and, to be effective, security assessments must feed into business risk assessments and decisions. This paper describes the approaches taken by BT to ensure that security risk assessments are conducted within a consistent framework and integrated into decisionmaking processes for outsourcing ICT contracts. Specific tools and techniques have been developed to ensure that engagement with stakeholders is effective and timely, that risks and requirements are identified and understood, and that risk mitigation and management strategies are implemented within appropriate compliance and governance frameworks. The method employed by BT is based on the UK Government's Infosec Standard No. 1: Residual Risk Assessment Method (IS1) and has been tailored to suit a commercial environment. To implement the method, many sources of security profiling data have been consolidated from across the business to create a full picture of information confidentiality, integrity and availability risks; this includes legal and regulatory issues and BT's responsibilities as a fundamental component of the UK Critical National Infrastructure. This has enabled new approaches to categorising systems and applications in terms of data value and impact. To cater for the 'industrial scale' volume of outsourcing requests, automation has been introduced to enable consistent and speedy assessments and to improve the means of communicating the results to stakeholders. The paper also highlights the importance of a taking a hierarchical approach to conducting risk assessments and setting security requirements - within the context of system and contract lifecycles and the need for effective protective monitoring and audit regimes. © 2006 British Telecommunications PLC.","Audit; Availability; Compliance; Confidentiality; Critical National Infrastructure; Governance; Information assurance; Integrity; Offshoring; Outsourcing; Residual Risk Assessment Method (IS1); Security requirements; Security risk assessments; Security risk management","Availability; Critical infrastructures; Industrial management; Information technology; Management science; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Audit; Compliance; Confidentiality; Governance; Information assurance; Integrity; National infrastructure; Off-shoring; Residual risk; Security requirements; Security risk assessments; Outsourcing"

A number of encryption techniques have been proposed in the literature, which includes double random-phase encryption, polarization encoding, encryption and verification using a multiplexed minimum average correlation energy phase-encrypted filter. Most of these reports employ a pseudo-random code for each information to be encrypted, where it requires individual storage capacity or transmission channel for further processing of each information. The objective of this paper is to develop an optical encryption system employing quadrature multiplexing to enhance the storage/transmission capacity of the system. Two information signals are encrypted using the same code but employing two orthogonal functions and then they are multiplexed together in the same domain. As the orthogonal functions have zero cross-correlation between them, so the encrypted information are expected to be unaffected by each other. Each encryption and multiplexing process can accommodate two information signals for a single code and a single storage cell or transmission channel. The same process can be performed in multiple steps to increase the multiplexing capability of the system. For decryption purpose, the composite encoded signal is correlated using the appropriate code and the appropriate function. The proposed technique has been found to work excellent in computer simulation with binary as well as gray level images. It has also been verified that the encrypted images remain secure, because no unwanted reproduction is possible without having the appropriate code and function.","Decryption; Encryption; Optical information processing; Pseudorandom code; Quadrature multiplexing","Cryptography; Multiplexing; Optical communication; Optical correlation; Security of data; Cross correlation; Decryption; Pseudorandom code; Quadrature multiplexing; Optical data processing"

The motivation for remote operation is increased income, cost reductions and more efficient support. The technology used to support operations is changing from proprietary closed systems to standardized IT systems built on PCs and MS Windows connected to both internal networks and the Internet. In addition the operations and management of the oil and gas fields are increasingly being performed by a network of companies that functions as a virtual organization. The network organizations and the increased number of vulnerabilities create the need for improved information security. Our hypothesis is that an important contribution to improved information security is improved safety and security culture and improved communication during operations and incident handling. Safety and security culture should be explicitly focused and actions should be taken to improve the culture to an ideal learning culture. We have developed a method called CheckIT consisting of a questionnaire and a process to improve security and safety culture based on group discussions. The questionnaire consists of questions and exclusive response alternatives related to denial based culture, rule based culture and the ideal learning culture, to enable the participants to explore their culture and identify areas to be improved.

The majority of the hospitalizations are unplanned, thus leaving little time for preparation of patient records. Even though electronic health records (EHR) are becoming more and more prevalent, the patient information is usually scattered over several clinical systems since the clinical information is local or specific to wards. A patient may easily have hundreds of separate, overlapping records in various systems. This limits the availability of the information. A typical trend in order to solve this is by initializing integration efforts of the most central clinical systems, such as the laboratory systems, X-ray and EHR system. However, it is vitally important that the advantages of information integration do not sacrifice the patient privacy. Access control is therefore one of the key issues to be able to successfully merge and make efficient use of the large quantities of information. The flow of information between systems should not compromise the access control rules for the information in any of the systems, and this can be a challenge to achieve if not properly planned and implemented. Most countries have strict legislation when it comes to sharing of sensitive healthcare information, and it is an ongoing discussion on how the privacy requirements sometimes actually compromises the patient safety by limiting the information to specific personnel on a need-to-know basis. Functionality for emergency or ""blue light"" access is implemented in most of the central clinical systems, but there are indications that this is being used on a too regular basis and therefore undermines patient privacy. Hospitals are complex organization; something which is reflected in work flow and patient flow. This makes it difficult to create access control solutions, and will often result in either too wide general access control rights, or too extensive use of emergency access mechanisms. All this opens up possibilities for misuse. Discovering conflicts and grey areas is a first step towards understanding them and being able to mediate between the two important qualities patient safety and patient privacy. To avoid a belligerent conflict one needs a clear overview of both of these sides, which in turn makes it possible to let the safety and security aspects complement each other instead of being in opposition. In many's opinion there are two opposing trenches, with aspects related to information security on one side and patient safety on the other. This paper focuses on how to detect conflicts and grey areas between patient safety and patient privacy, and shows some typical examples of such conflicts. It describes a set of applicable methods for analyzing planned or on-going healthcare integration efforts with a special focus on access control, and shows how these methods can be used to detect and mediate conflicts between health information security and patient privacy. The methods have been developed for and applied on some of the major hospitals in Norway. © 2006 by ASME.","","Health care; Hospitals; Safety engineering; Clinical information; Electronic health record; Health informations; Information integration; Laboratory system; Patient information; Privacy requirements; Safety and securities; Access control"

This prescriptive model states that, when faced with a choice, a rational decision maker will pick the prospect that offers the highest expected utility. But as has been demonstrated by Kahnemann and Tversky in Prospect Theory, decision-making under uncertainty often deviates from what Expected Utility Theory predicts, largely depending on whether the decision is framed as a gain or a loss. According to their model, choices framed as gains often lead to risk-averse behavior, and choices framed as losses often induce risk-seeking behavior. This paper reviews various theories of decision-making under uncertainty and evaluates the relevance of Prospect Theory in the information security context. An instrument is developed to evaluate relevance, preliminary results are presented, and implications for future research are discussed.","Information security; Prospect theory","Decision making; Information systems; Security of data; Decision makers; Expected utility; Expected utility theory; Model state; Prospect theory; Decision theory"

Slovic's perception of risk theory will be used as a theoretical foundation for this study. The paper will focus on the neglected human element of information security management, with the primary focus on employees' actions that unintentionally expose organizational information to security risks. These employee actions can threaten information contained within the organization's computer-based systems as well as information in the form of computer-based system output, such as printed reports, customer receipts, and backup tapes. There has been substantial literature exploring the human threat to organizational information; however past research has focused on intentional behavior, typically referred to as ""computer abuse"". Less research has investigated employees' actions that unintentionally expose an organization to information security risks. Based upon this premise, the purpose of this study is to draw attention to such human threats and in turn shed light on the relationship between unintentional threats caused by employees' behavior and information security risks. Using a case study conducted in a financial institution, this study investigates these unintentional threats and management's perception of potential information security risks that these employees' actions may cause. The research reveals that many of management's taken-for-granted assumptions about information security within their organization are inaccurate. It is suggested that by increasing management's awareness of these risks, they will take precautions to eliminate this behavior to ensure that the organization's information is better secured.","Information security; Information security threats; Perception of risk","Human resource management; Information systems; Management; Research; Security of data; Security systems; Computer abuse; Computer-based system; Financial institution; Information security managements; Information security policies; Information security threats; Organizational information; Risk theory; Security risks; Technology solutions; Theoretical foundations; Risk perception"

A complementary view to understanding the influences of user behavior is the organizational context within which users act. Investigating both influences of user behavior and organizational context simultaneously is proposed to best answer the recent calls to use a socio-organizational approach in IT security research. Two prominent bodies of research, the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) used to frame the influences of user behavior and the organizational behavioral contextual concept of psychological climate, are integrated to develop a multidimensional facet-specific IT security model.","IT security; Psychological climate; Theory of planned behavior","Climate models; Extranets; Information systems; Security of data; Security systems; Behavioral intention; IT security; Organizational context; Psychological climate; Theory of Planned Behavior; User behaviors; Behavioral research"

Also, organizations often outsource risk assessment tasks and often conduct these assessments periodically (annually or bi-annually) rather than continuously. Solutions that support continuous analysis of threats, vulnerabilities, and risk impact data are very important because they allow security staff to reevaluate and enhance the controls to prevent successful intrusions, which results in reducing the harm caused by successful attacks as well as decreasing the risks of losing the data and the need to perform recovery and extensive postincident forensic analyses. Therefore, there is a need for the increase of automated auditing and intelligent reporting mechanisms that must support risk assessment and threat management.

(2) If so, is such a reference architecture useful for security architecture design in software product lines? Initial evidence suggests that both questions can be affirmed. The main contribution of this chapter is a reference architecture that draws upon state-of-the-art techniques and practices from software product line engineering and information security and constitutes a decision support framework for security architecture design in software product lines. To validate the reference architecture, the chapter also presents our experiences from using it at three distinct companies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","",""

Adverse selection in InfoSec budgeting occurs when top management cannot validate the soundness of the ISF's requests for InfoSec investments. IT governance may control adverse selection because it aims at the alignment between business and IT and facilitates monitoring and bonding. Three types of governance mechanisms - process-based, structural, and relational, are analyzed. They are hypothesized to help to reduce information asymmetry. Less asymmetry leads to reduction in adverse selection, which, in turn, boosts top management confidence in InfoSec success. Based on these, a research model is presented and survey research designed to test it.","Adverse selection; Agency theory; Information asymmetry; Information security; IT budget","Information systems; Risk management; Security of data; Adverse selection; Agency theory; Information asymmetry; IT budgets; IT governance; Research models; Survey research; Top management; Budget control"

For example they may provide extensive information on a region's nuclear power plants or water supply systems or emergency preparedness. It is possible for terrorists and other malcontents to use such information to identify 'soft targets'. However, due to laws such as the Freedom of Information Act, and also due to precedent, the government cannot simply choose not to provide much of this information. This calls for a mechanism whereby the government may be able to intelligently control the dissemination of information so as to reduce the probability of sensitive information falling into the wrong hands. In particular, the government needs a system to analyze and assess the legitimacy of claims to information. This paper proposes an agent-based framework that has the potential to allow the government to control, in an intelligent fashion, the dissemination of sensitive information via government websites. This framework employs the 'Toulmin method for analyzing arguments' to assess the legitimacy of claims to information on government websites.","Government websites; Information security; Toulmin","Information systems; Nuclear power plants; Security of data; Terrorism; Water supply systems; Websites; Agent-based framework; Emergency preparedness; Freedom of Information Act; Government websites; Intelligent fashion; Right-to-know; Sensitive informations; Soft targets; Toulmin; Information dissemination"

But security is notoriously hard to quantify, since absence of activity challenges us to establish whether lack of successful attacks is the result of good security or merely due to good luck. However, viewing security as the inverse of risk enables us to use computations of expected loss to develop a quantitative approach to measuring gains in security by measuring decreases in risk. In using such an approach, making decisions concerning investments in information security requires calculation of net benefits expected to result from the investment. Unfortunately, little data are available upon which to base an estimate of the probabilities required for developing the expected losses. This paper develops a mathematical approach to risk management based on Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen non-parametric estimators of the probability distributions needed for using the resulting quantitative risk management tools. Differences between the integrals of these estimators evaluated for enhanced and control groups of systems in an information infrastructure provide a metric for measuring increased security. When combined with an appropriate value function, the expected losses can be calculated and investments evaluated quantitatively in terms of actual enhancements to security. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally, policy specification has not been an explicit part of the software development process. This isolation of policy specification from software development often results in policies that are not in compliance with system requirements and/or organizational security and privacy policies, leaving the system vulnerable to data breaches. This paper presents the results and lessons learned from a case study that employs the Requirements-based Access Control Analysis and Policy Specification (ReCAPS) method to specify access control policies for a web-based event registration system. The ReCAPS method aids software and security engineers in specifying access control policies derived from requirements specifications and other available sources. Our case study revealed that the ReCAPS method helps identify inconsistencies across various software artifacts, such as requirements specification, database design, and organizational security and privacy policies. Had these problems not been identified and resolved, they would have crippled later phases of software development, resulted in missing or incomplete system functionality, and compromised the system's security and privacy. This case study reinforces, validates, and extends our previous recommendations that access control policy specification should be an integral part of the software development process for information systems to achieve information assurance and improve the quality of the information system. © 2006 IEEE.","Access control; Policy specification; Requirements analysis; Software design","Information retrieval systems; Product development; Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Security of data; Specifications; Access control; Policy specification; Requirements analysis; Software design; Computer aided software engineering"

Furthermore, Boards of directors should consider information security an essential element of corporate governance and a top priority for board review. In establishing this approach, there are five principles that will help guide executive thinking: 1. The first principle is that the CEO must get involved in the understanding of the security program, the measurement of that program and the relation that program has to business operations. 2. The second principle is that the organization itself has to understand that information assets must be thought of as being as measurable and as tangible as buildings and plants and other valuable business infrastructure 3. The third principle is that we must follow the information and not the system. 4. The fourth principle is that we evaluate the information security services that have been implemented and find a way to validate that they are working. 5. The fifth principle, every bit as important as the others, is that it is vital for organizations to analyze where they stand in their information security governance efforts compared to others in their industry. To implement these principles, information security stakeholders need to make significant shifts in their perspective. Such shifts allow them to ask the right questions, make better decisions, and select actions appropriate to the effective governance of enterprise security. We will explain these shifts. The next point is to divide the work across five areas of responsibility. According to our principles, we will describe a framework addressing all components of the enterprise security program not just the technical components.","","Blending; Industrial management; Boards of directors; Business infrastructure; Business operation; Corporate governance; Enterprise security; Essential elements; Information assets; Information security governance; Security of data"

The theoretical model developed is based on the framework of the theory of planned behavior and Hofstede's cultural dimensions and indices. Several hypotheses about the moderating effect of culture on the strength of the model's relationships were developed.

Technically, they possess several hundreds of extensively interconnected and heterogeneous IT systems performing tasks that vary from Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) to real-time control and monitoring of the processes, such as Distributed Control System (DCS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA). Organizationally, the enterprise system embraces business processes and business units using, as well as maintaining and acquiring, the IT systems. Information and systems are to a large extent becoming integrated in industry operations since communication and sharing of information are becoming more efficient and faster than before. However, the networking and interconnection of systems can increase the enterprise exposure to information security risks. The significance of information security has been continuously increasing in the management of organizations and in ensuring their operating ability as well as in maintaining disturbance-free and efficient operations. Thus, enterprise information security has become an increasingly important system quality. Assessing a sufficient level of information security is a necessary pre-requisite for the continuance and credibility of operations. But assessing the level of information security in an enterprise is a serious challenge for many organizations, since the area still lacks sufficient support for decision-making on a top-management level. One problem with such assessments is that there are various views on what, exactly, should be measured. There are different opinions on what the constituent parts of enterprise information security are and what these parts' relative importance is. Addressing that problem, this paper presents an operational definition and prioritization of the field of enterprise information security. First, the paper proposes a framework for capturing the semantic essence of enterprise information security. Then, the relative weights of the framework's subdomains are quantified. Two methods for prioritization are used to obtain the weights. The results demonstrate to what extent different standards committees, guideline authors and expert groups differ in their opinions on what the important issues are in enterprise information security. As prioritization sources, the ISO/IEC 17799, the NIST SP 800-26, the ISF standards committees, the CMU/SEI OCTAVE framework authors and an expert panel at the Swedish Information Processing Society (DFS) are considered. To demonstrate the practical consequences, the effects of varying prioritizations on the enterprise information security assessment results in a European energy company are presented.","Assessment; Enterprise; Information; Prioritization; Security","Data processing; Distributed parameter networks; Electric utilities; Enterprise resource planning; Industry; Real time control; SCADA systems; Security of data; Semantics; Assessment; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Industry operations; Information; Information security risks; Operational definition; Prioritization; Security; Information technology"

The technology used to support operations and exception handling is changing from proprietary closed systems to standardized IT systems built on PCs and MS Windows. The PCs are integrated in networks that can be connected to the Internet. This leads to a major change in which threats the industry faces. PCs using MS Windows are vulnerable, new exploits are continuously found and the number of hacker attacks is increasing. The reliance on MS Windows and Internet is thus increasing the vulnerability of the oil and gas production. In addition, a network of companies that functions as a virtual organization is increasingly performing the operations and management of the oil and gas fields. These virtual organizations and the increased number of vulnerabilities create the need for common safety and security culture, communication and incident management during regular operations and when handling information security incidents. In this paper, these challenges are presented and discussed, and a suggestion for a standardized scheme for Incident Response Management in the North Sea is proposed. We suggest exploring information security incidents across the virtual organizations, and to standardize on reporting and on training to be able to establish common goals and objectives. All in order to establish more resilient organizations and systems related to information security. © 2006 by ASME.","","Computation theory; Internet; Oil fields; Personal computing; Response time (computer systems); Safety engineering; Security of data; Exception handling; Incident Management; Incident Response Management; Information security incidents; Oil and gas production; Safety and securities; Support operations; Virtual organization; Information technology"

Security people maintain that the safety people are just a gang of old men who are unwilling to learn something new, the safety people retaliate that the security people are youngsters who haven't realized that they're re-inventing the wheel! Certainly there is a communication problem between the two groups: each has developed its own vocabulary for similar - or even identical - concepts, which at least produces confusion. In this paper, some of the common properties and differences between terms and techniques in the two communities are discussed with the aim of reconciling potential conflicts and exploring potential for cooperation, convergence and mutual benefits. We concentrate on the context of information technology, i.e. safety related software and information security. The underlying concepts of safety and security are indeed not identical, they're complementary. In both cases we have a ""system"" in an environment. The system might be able to have an undesirable effect on its environment, but the environment can equally well have an undesirable effect on the system. The inability of the system to affect its environment in an undesirable way is usually called safety; the inability of the environment to affect the system in an undesirable way is usually called security. Depending on the type of system, its environment and the types of undesirable effects one can have on the other we get a multitude of definitions for safety and security. While safety related software aims at protecting life, health and the natural environment from any damage the system may cause, within information security the main goal is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in the system,. Safety focuses on unintentional events, while security also focuses on threats coming from outside the system, often caused by malicious parties. These differences result in different foundations for prioritizing solutions. A closer cooperation between safety and security experts will cover both unintentional and intentional events. When analyzing the risks for an IT-system one should focus on the whole picture - including both safety and security, not just one or the other. By doing so one obtains a complete overview of potential threats/hazards towards a system. The techniques used in software safety have been around for quite some time and are well established and tested. Some of these techniques may be useful also for security people who may thus benefit from the experiences of the safety community. On the other hand, there are also security techniques that will become significant for the safety community. For example, in the near future we will see more use of open communication networks for remote control of industrial and transportation applications. When vitally important commands are transmitted through such open networks, security techniques such as encryption and access control will become indispensable for safety. Security techniques will have to become an integral part of safety thinking. Software safety and information security are not separate issues. Information security breaches can compromise the ability of software to function safely, or they can enable misuse of safe software in an unsafe way. Safety breaches can make information security impossible. As such, both sides stand to benefit from closer cooperation. To enable cooperation one needs to reach an agreement on which terms to use and how to interpret them, and also on what techniques to use. Although the safety field has a longer track record, to be able to cover both aspects one needs to adopt techniques from both fields - or possibly merge existing techniques or create new ones. © 2006 by ASME.","","Communication; Computer software selection and evaluation; Information technology; Safety engineering; Communication problems; Natural environments; Potential conflict; Potential threats; Safety and securities; Safety related software; Software safety; Undesirable effects; Security of data"

When microdata is released to users, attributes that clearly identify individuals are generally removed. However, it is still possible to link released data with some public or easy-to-access database to obtain confidential information. Numerous techniques, such as generalization, suppression, and microaggregation, have been proposed to modify the released data to safeguard privacy. In this paper, we propose attribute-oriented granulation as a data modification method. We address the computational issue of searching for the most specific granulation that satisfies confidentiality requirements. A breadth-first search algorithm with basic pruning strategies is presented and its properties are investigated. The properties can be used to improve the efficiency of our algorithm. We also define the quantitative measures of data quality and safety, and apply evolutionary computation techniques to find the optimal granulation for privacy protection. © 2006 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Computational methods; Cryptography; Data structures; Security of data; Attribute-oriented granulation; Privacy protection; Search algorithms; Data privacy"

However, how to design an integrated information system to achieve effective diversity is still a challenge due to combinatorially exploded solution space and multiple conflicting design objectives. In the paper, we present a systematic framework employing a combination of configuration evaluation through controlled system simulations and a neural network based feedback learning mechanism to explore the solution space, thus achieving an effective design solution for the integrated system. A simulation model is employed to evaluate design solutions, and an artificial neural network is trained to approximate the behavior of the system using system feedback. Guided by the trained neural network, a multiple-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is proposed to search the solution space and identify potential good solutions. The MOEA incorporates the concept of Herbert Simon's satisficing. It integrates the decision maker's preference and uses his/her aspiration level for the performance as its search direction. Potentially good solutions are then evaluated through simulation. The newly obtained simulation results can refine the neural network. The exploration process stops until the result convergences or a satisfied solution is found. We demonstrate and validate our framework through a case study.","Artificial neural network; Diversity/diversification; Information assurance; Multiple-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA); Satisficing; System functionality defense","Computer simulation; Design; Neural networks; Viruses; Diversity/diversification; Information assurance; Multiple-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA); Satisficing; System functionality; Information systems"

Inter and intra connected ICT systems, open ICT architectures and shared communication infrastructures have been adopted for information exchange and maintenance purposes by technologically advanced power utilities. They are also becoming a reality in the future ICT applications supporting the remote control of interconnected power infrastructures composed by bulk and dispersed power generation, and the associated power grids. Any standard for ICT security management requires performing security risk assessment. Efforts for adapting these standards to industrial control systems are ongoing. In the electricity sector, two basic research directions on risk assessment have been undertaken: the definition of a vulnerability and risk assessment procedure specific for cyber security and the development of probabilistic approaches to the risk analysis of electrical contingencies. However the emerging frameworks, while allowing a more in-depth analysis with respect to the deterministic approach based on the N-1 criterion, do not cover the evaluation of both contingencies and automation failures, and a comprehensive risk assessment methodology is far from becoming a state of practice. The paper aims at providing a step forward in the cyber security analysis of electric power control systems, introducing the key aspects of a methodology supporting the security evaluation of power utility information systems, as complex interacting infrastructures involving process knowledge, advanced control and information and communication technologies. The methodology is mainly addressed to security technical managers as an offline analysis tool supporting the power system design and planning phases. It may also be used by the security operators as a support tool for security audits and intrusion monitoring activities during the system operation phase, thus contributing at preventing and counteracting the risk of control system degradation or block. The three basic functions of the methodology are: the correlation of security concepts, the computation of security indexes and the consequent evaluation of security failures.

Disruption of critical operational information systems can have serious financial impacts. According to a CSI/FBI report (2004), losses from security breaches have risen rapidly in recent years and exceeded $200 million in 2003. The information security field is very diverse and combines disciplines such as computer science, business, information science, engineering, education, psychology, criminal justice, public administration, law, and accounting.

While responsibility for security rests largely with the national activities, the EU has also started planning a research area ""Space and security"" as a part of the 7th Framework Programme. As the justification for this research area it has been presented that ""Technology alone can not assure security, but security can not be assured without the support of technology."" Furthermore, the justification highlights that security and military research are becoming ever closer. The old separation between civil and military research is decreasing, because it has been noticed that both areas are nowadays utilising the same knowledge. In Finland, there is already now noteworthy entrepreneurship related to security. Although some of the companies are currently only operating in Finland, others are already international leaders in their area. The importance of the security area is increasing and remarkable potential for new growth business areas can already be identified. This however also requires an increase in research efforts. VTT has a broad range of security research ongoing in many technology areas. The main areas have been concentrating on public safety and security, but VTT is participating also in several research projects related to the defence technology. For identifying and defining in more detail the expertise and research goals, the Security research roadmap was developed. The roadmap identified three particularly significant areas related to security. The assurance of critical infrastructure emphasises the protection of energy networks, information networks, water supply, traffic and transport, and obviously also the citizens. For assuring the activities of entrepreneurship, significant areas include the security of production and services, the security of sites and assets, and information security for embedded systems. The most important security products and technologies needed are, for example, management of total security, detection, identification, localisation and communication, protection of information networks and systems, and physical protection.

Earlier, business operations of most large companies were supported by a number of isolated software systems performing diverse specific tasks, from real-time process control to administrative functions. Today many companies possess a highly complex enterprise-wide IT system; in large organizations several hundreds of interconnected systems may be employed. The industry is challenged by two major changes; the integration of administrative systems and operation support systems and the deregulation of the electricity market. The deregulation affects the deployment of IT in many ways; new IT support is needed for many business processes, e.g. billing. The ever changing business environment challenges contemporary organizations to constantly get most value from their IT. The Chief Information Officer, CIO, is responsible for IT management which is a significant challenge today. This paper uses the Architecture Theory Diagram (ATD) for modeling the CIO's responsibilities. The ATD spans the concerns of the CIO and is based on consolidated knowledge from existing architecture theories and frameworks. This paper presents the result from a survey where the concerns stated in the ATD were prioritized by CIOs at European electric power industries. The result can be used by CIOs for benchmarking. A prioritized set of concerns can be used for communicating to the rest of the organization what is important and be used as a basis for IT investments decisions and determining strategy. This paper is based on a survey answered by CIOs in the European electric power industry in January and February 2005. The survey was answered by twelve supreme IT chiefs at Electric Power Industries in Europe. All the respondents come from different countries and ten of the respondents are members in Cigré. The respondents consist of 75 % CIOs and 59 % of all the respondents' reports directly to their CEO. Results from the survey indicates that ""Developing strategies"", ""IT and business alignment"", and ""Information security"" are the three most important concerns for the European CIOs' in general. Then it is a large gap down to the fourth most important concern, which is ""Project management"". The paper is concluded with recommendation on how companies can use this survey to focus and communicating their prioritizations. The survey has been conducted in cooperation with the CIO-group at Vattenfall, Cigré and the Department of Industrial Information and Control Systems (ICS) at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden.","Chief information officer (CIO); IT management; Strategic information system management","Deregulation; Electric industry; Intelligent control; Investments; Personnel; Project management; Security of data; Surveys; Changing business environment; Chief information officer; Electric power industries; IT management; Operation support system; Real-time process control; Royal Institute of Technology; Strategic information systems; Information technology"

Organizations manage and exchange data and even control processes over an increasingly interweaved information highway. Along with this new paradigm of operation comes an ever-increasing reliance on this information technology infrastructure, not only internal to the organization, but externally as well. Essential business functions rely on its continuity. Survivability analysis is an area of research and practice designed to conduct a systematic evaluation of an organization's resilience against and also in the midst of adversarial events. The common solution to many of these analyses is to implement technological solutions such as redundant networks, new software patches, firewalls, automated backup systems, etc. Research in this area has failed to a large extent to address the most critical component of system survivability-the human. The strongest wall in the world does no good if the door is left unlocked, i.e. technological solutions will fail if they are not employed correctly. The first section of this paper will present a brief overview of survivability analysis and the potential impact of human performance with a focus on human error. Next, the paper examines human error and its effect on survivability issues including case studies and potential mitigation strategies. The purpose of this paper is to examine how human performance can influence computer network survivability. Additionally, this paper will introduce human reliability analysis (HRA) as a method for identifying and describing human performance as a system component for survivability analysis. In comparison with other domains such as aeronautics and the nuclear industry, the information technology domain significantly lags in its evaluation and assessment of human contribution to overall system performance including system survivability. While formal HRA methods may not be appropriate for all organizations, task analysis and data collection are activities that should be part of an ongoing information management program. While this paper focuses on the deleterious aspect of human performance, the positive impact of human performance must also be noted. Although sometimes the weakest link in the chain, the human operator or employee can be a stop-gate that prevents system failure or compromise. For employees to be fully utilized as an asset in information security and network system survivability, a strong understanding of their role, skills, and performance shaping factors within their task domain is essential. © 2006 by ASME.","","Computer system firewalls; Errors; Information management; Job analysis; Nuclear industry; Research; Safety engineering; Security of data; Human reliability analysis; Information technology infrastructure; Network survivability; Performance shaping factors; Survivability analysis; System survivability; Systematic evaluation; Technological solution; Information technology"

However implementation of such a policy can be expensive and not feasible for Small businesses. This paper presents a study of Small businesses in South Wales that use a mixture of Internet connected standalone computers and Local Areas Networks (LANs). It looks at the security measures they have in place and whether or not they have an information security policy. Findings show that most Small Medium sized businesses do not have such a policy document, but many are using components that would normally form part of such policy, within their staff employment manuals. This is a much cheaper and less time consuming way of using the more important and relevant components that usually make up such a policy.","eMail use policies; Information security policy; Internet usage policies; Password policies and employment manual and staff manuals","Internet; Security of data; Critical information; Information security policies; Internet usage; Medium-sized business; Password policies and employment manual and staff manuals; Policy documents; Relevant components; Security measure; Small and medium sized business; Small business; Security systems"

This study also examines the effects of such announcements on a portfolio of the firm's competitors in an effort to examine the contagion and competitive intra-industry effects. We find that the market value of an affected firm's competitors increases following the announcement of a security breach, consistent with the competitive model of intra-industry effects. The magnitude of the competitive effect appears to depend on the nature of the security breach. The increase in competitor value is higher when the security breach involves non-confidential firm and customer information.

The height distributions of the two surface-relief PMs are designed by using an iterative phase-retrieval algorithm in combination with the conjugate-gradient method. Two PMs are located at the predesigned positions in the verification system. When a plane wave with a correct wavelength illuminates the optical verification system, the corresponding image is extracted to display on the output plane. Another incident plane wave with other different wavelength which was used in recording can produce another image. Only when all the frames of images recorded by different wavelengths are obtained, the user can then pass through the verification procedure. Compared with the previous encryption and verification technique, these predesigned wavelengths can be used as additional verification keys, which should significantly enhance the security of system. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed technique can successfully reconstruct the verification images for the authorized user having all the correct keys, but never for any unauthorized intruder. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

The new trend is to use economical models (mainly game-theoretic models) to characterize such malicious behaviors in the security context with the aim to mitigate the risk introduced by such malicious behaviors. However, there is a general lack in the integration of risk and security and this hinders the effectiveness of these existing economical models when applied in the security context for distributed systems. Recently, utility has become an important consideration for information security. We show that the decisions by security mechanisms, such as the authorization decisions in a distributed system can have a direct impact on the utility of the underlying system. However there is little work done on utility maximization when designing secure distributed systems. To address this gap, we present in this paper a new approach through integrating risk management into security with the help of a trust model. Furthermore, we show that the proposed trust based security model with risk management can be applied to maximize the utility of the underlying distributed systems. The new model possesses a unique feature - the ability to use trust evaluation to not only ""weed out"" malicious entities, but also allocate appropriate access permissions to the benevolent entities according to the risk levels. Using a mobile agent system as an example, we study the properties of the proposed model through simulation and present the experimental results which confirm the mew feature of the proposal. © 2006 IEEE.","","Computer simulation; Distributed computer systems; Game theory; Mathematical models; Security of data; Systems analysis; Distributed systems; Economical models; Mobile agent system; Risk management"

The report takes into attention administrative, procedural and software-hardware actions. Administrative methods include development of policy in the sphere of information security and drawing up documents that regulate solving of the assigned tasks. Among procedural actions are those that aim at work with personnel, equipping security utilities with technical security systems, supporting operating capability of information security systems and acting on security regime disturbance. SCADA/EMS systems are vulnerable for unauthorized access due to the fact that information security networks, telecommunications are complex and distributed. Therefore, there are a number of software-hardware methods, the purpose of which is to provide security.

From the perspective of an organization, security is an investment to be estimated as costsaving due to reduced losses from security breaches. Besides that, any new ventures that are profitable for the organization and would not be implemented without security countermeasures need to be considered. Any organization should follow a riskmanagement strategy according to their needs. Organizations that overprotect their information infrastructure will have spent too much on information security.

Systems such as Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) will improve efficiency of pre-flight and post-flight procedures and in-flight decision support. Enhanced communication, navigation, and surveillance systems will improve routing efficiency and situational awareness. Advanced maintenance systems will improve prognostics, diagnostics, and scheduling of maintenance actions. New cabin applications will enhance passenger services, such as buy-on-board programs and flight re-booking; passenger entertainment, including live audio and video; and passenger communications, such as in-flight cellular service and broadband Internet access for e-mail and web browsing. While many of these ""new"" aircraft functions may appear routine to users of the Internet, the inter-networking that is required both on and off the aircraft poses significant technical and operational challenges for airlines and their suppliers. Aircraft information security is one of the key challenges. This paper provides an overview of ARINC Report 811, Commercial Aircraft Information Security Concepts of Operation and Process Framework [1]. ARINC Report 811 was developed by airline and industry participants of the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) Aircraft Information Security (SEC) Subcommittee, and it was adopted by the airline members of the AEEC in October 2005. ARINC Report 811 describes a three-step risk-based information security process framework, that considers existing airline operations and the organizational impact associated with the introduction of new aircraft information security procedures, particularly with respect to the management of mobile, global aircraft assets. © 2006 IEEE.","","Aircraft; Aircraft instruments; Avionics; Costs; Decision support systems; Digital arithmetic; Electronics engineering; Finance; Industrial economics; Information management; Information services; Internet; Ion beams; Maintainability; Maintenance; Operating costs; Public key cryptography; Rhenium; Routing algorithms; Wireless networks; (e ,3e) process; (min ,max ,+) functions; air travels; aircraft systems; airline operations; Broadband internet access; Cellular services; Commercial aircraft; commercial airlines; Concepts of operation (CONOPS); Decision supports; Digital avionics; Electronic flight bag (EFB); Flight procedures; Growing demand; Information security; Inter-networking; Live audio; Maintenance actions; Maintenance systems; On-board; Operational challenges; Organizational impacts; passenger services; Pre flighting; Routing efficiency; Situational awareness (SA); Surveillance System (MSS); web browsing; Air transportation"

The compromised router can either passively or actively perform the malicious activities against the forwarding packets. The SQoS network does not explicitly specify the method to detect whether the data contained in the packets have been tampered by the compromised routers or by the end host itself.

SOA technologies embrace network services that are 1) platform neutral, 2) language neutral, 3) interoperable, 4) loosely coupled, 5) encapsulated and 6) support dynamic find-andbind capabilities. This emerging distributed Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS&A) SOA technology must provide wire-level interoperability using existing Internet protocols deployed on real Command and Control (C2) systems. The new distributed MS&A infrastructure must also support net-centricity, which requires supporting the following four Net Ready-Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPP): 1) compliance with the Net-Centric Operations and Warfare- Reference Model (NCOW-RM), 2) supporting DoDAF integrated architecture products, 3) compliance with Key Interface Profiles, and 4) verification of compliance with DoD Information Assurance (IA) requirements. To date DIS, HLA and TENA have ignored the fourth NR-KPP by not providing any innate security services. The-next generation distributed M&S standard used by the DoD must support IA by providing appropriate IA controls identified in the DoD 8500 IA regulations to satisfy the fourth NR-KPP. This paper will identify a convergence strategy to enable existing distributed MS&A standards to use Net-Centric Enterprise Services for Security (NCES-Security) by identifying an emerging four layer SOA model that can be integrated with NCES Security services with SIP/S, XMPP, HTTP/S and S/RTP protocol bindings. With the proper mix of popular Web protocols, SOA technology, publish, subscribe, notify, conferencing and the judicious application of NCES Security Policy Enforcement Points (PEP) and Policy Decision Points (PDP), net-centric distributed MS&A will become a reality in the next few years. The emergence of this new technology will not rely solely on either DIS, HLA or TENA, but it will be interoperable with them all and will not require the development of specialized distributed MS&A Multi-Level Security (MLS) guards (e.g., RMG, DTNG) but will instead leverage net-centric commodity firewalls supporting Web Services Description Language (WSDL) PEP interface. WSDL PEP interfaces are being supported by more firewall vendors and they appear to be the access control cornerstone for next generation net-centric C2 MLS guard technology. Now, after ten years, the next big epoch for distributed MS&A is upon us.","DIS; HLA; Information assurance; Mashup; SIP; SOA; TENA","Access control; Command and control systems; Computer viruses; Internet protocols; Microwave circuits; Network architecture; Service oriented architecture (SOA); DIS; HLA; Information assurance; Mashup; SIP; SOA; TENA; Interoperability"

Most of the commercial websites providing email facility today provide some form of programmable automatic filtration of junk mails, typically in the form of a set of rules to dispose of mails based on keywords detected in headers or message body. There are some other methods for the purpose as well, but an adaptive email filtering system based on Bayesian technique that can learn from its user's mail preferences appears to be a better solution. It not only considers the keywords that identify spam, but also words that denote innocent or legitimate mail which makes the filter more efficient. However direct marketers discover new ways to evade even the Bayesian filters, so as to reach the potential customers. The way most commonly adopted by the spammers to mislead the Bayesian filters is injection of out of context text in the email. This paper aims at presenting a critical analysis of the various ways adopted by spammers to dodge the spam filters. Further we explore the Bayesian Noise Reduction (BNR) technique which attempts to solve this problem by identifying and eliminating the 'out of context' data (so injected by spammers or otherwise) to provide a cleaner classification. © 2006 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Computer networks; Electronic mail; Filtration; Industrial economics; Information services; Information technology; Injection (oil wells); Internet; Learning systems; Porous materials; Technology; Junk mails; Spam filtering; Spammers; Spamming"

This is instrumental in managing complex and dynamic systems where change can impact other subsystems and associated documentation. It helps to identify the affected artefacts through many layers. Benefits to this approach would include better project planning and management, improved risk management, superior change management, ease of reuse, enhanced quality control and more effective acceptance testing. It would also improve the ability to audit, especially at a time when outsourcing of security functions is occurring throughout the world.

This paper explains why the decision to adopt an information security standard is one taken in a complex marketplace of competing standards, competing service providers, competing security design methods, and competing national and international legislative requirements, all under the oversight of closely watched audit firms and government regulators. While the dependence on standards for guidance in information security is growing, so is the complexity of the decision. The decision affects the economic justification of internal controls in information systems. Without regulatory standards, risk economics are necessary to justify acquisition and implementation of controls. With regulatory standards, risk economics are necessary to justify exceptions to the acquisition and implementation of controls. The impact of this economic shift may drive down organizational competitiveness or increase misleading compliance behaviour among IT professionals. © 2006 Richard Baskerville.","Compliance; Governance; Information systems security; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security standards","Commerce; Competition; Economic and social effects; Information systems; Risk analysis; Risk management; Security of data; Standards; Compliance; Economic justification; Governance; Government regulators; Information systems security; Internal controls; IT professional; Legislative requirements; Regulatory requirements; Regulatory standards; Security design; Security standards; Service provider; Technical decision; Regulatory compliance"

Indeed, the Internet and other large online proprietary business directories facilitate acquisition of business-related, or even technical, information for a particular organisation. It may also have potential implications on the competitiveness of an organisation, or lead to compromise of information assets, as vulnerabilities may be uncovered, publicised and potentially exploited through such exploratory operations of competitors. In the light of the importance of information security and many publicised incidents of corporate espionage, organisations are called to align competitive intelligence and information security within frameworks that emerge from the arena of Information Operations (IO). Secrecy and deception can be strategic business tools in an electronic business environment, however their use in an on-line world arises many issues. In this work, we firstly review the process of competitor intelligence and map it across the state-of-art information security and counter-intelligence measures. We afterwards try to expose the shaping of competitive intelligence as a business IO element and discuss on the implications and the challenging ethical issues that such a metamorphosis introduces, through practices such as perception management and vulnerability exploitation.","Business information warfare; Competitive intelligence; Ethics","Competition; Competitive intelligence; Security of data; Business information; Electronic business; Ethical issues; Ethics; Information assets; Information operations; Perception management; Strategic business; Philosophical aspects"

These networks are expected to execute additional queries or applications when the state of monitored phenomena is changing and, in general, have a dynamic set of applications deployed. In these kinds of networks resource management becomes an important issue, as the quality of information (IQ) delivered to a consumer may deteriorate significantly as applications are being added. In this paper we describe a framework which assures the quality of information delivered to a consumer in such a dynamic environment. The framework incorporates the characterization of various factors which affect the IQ. Namely, the resource contention between different applications is resolved via coordination of the selection of sensors which monitor the state of phenomena with the phenomena state distribution and resource allocation on individual sensors and their collective performance. The framework acts as an admission control scheme which assesses the above mentioned factors and application IQ requirements to decide if a sensor network is able to provide the required service. © 2006 IEEE.","","Data structures; Detectors; Information analysis; Information management; Knowledge management; Management; Monitoring; Natural resources management; Network management; Planning; Quality management; Resource allocation; Sensors; Admission Control scheme; Dynamic environments; Dynamic set; General (CO); Individual (PSS 544-7); international conferences; Monitor (CO); OF sensors; Quality of information (QoI); resource contention; Resource management (RM); State distribution (SD); Sensor networks"

Fundamental to the success of risk assessment and treatment is the decision making process that takes risk assessment output and assigns decisions to this output in terms of risk treatment actions. It is argued that the effectiveness of the management system lies in its ability to make effective, easytoimplement and measurable decisions. One of the key issues in decision making is ownership. In this paper two aspects of information security ownership are considered: ownership of the asset (as per the ISO/IEC 27001 definition) and ownership of the risk treatment actions. This paper discuses how traditional information security risk assessment methodologies confuse the ownership issue and raises the question as to whether this is simply because they are rebadged computer security risk assessment methodologies or because the significance and the complexity of ownership is underestimated in many forms of information security risk assessment.

Virtually all quantitative threat assessment and risk management programs use arithmetic means and expected values for analysis and resource prioritization and allocation. Although these methods work reasonably well around the centers of distributions, they underestimate the resources necessary to address threats from the tails of the distributions such as rare-but-deadly threats and ubiquitous-but-innocuous events; they also tend to over-allocate resources to relatively low-threat and low-impact risks. A cursory survey of current quantitative threat assessment and mitigation methodologies explains why their results may be inappropriate and how root-mean-square (RMS) methods for aggregating n-dimensional threat and impact components into Effective Risk Levels (ERL) yields results that correspond to expectations for risk management and resource-allocation purposes. Motivations and procedures for deriving continuous threat-factor functions are described and integrated into these hybrid RMS (HRMS) aggregation techniques, which may be used to construct security return-oninvestment (SROI) metrics for budget justification. These methods are also extensible to uncertain-programming applications (e.g. fuzzy logic) and reconciling differences of opinions among information security experts. When combined with operations research techniques such as multidimensional scaling, these methods may form the basis for developing the Emergent Standard Information Assurance Assessor. © 2006 IEEE.","","Finance; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Image segmentation; Industrial engineering; Information services; Instrument scales; Insurance; Management; Management science; Occupational risks; Ocean currents; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risks; Standardization; Standards; (2+1)-dimensional; (min ,max ,+) functions; Arithmetic means; Emergency warning systems; Expected values; Impact components; Indian oceans; Information security; International (CO); Metrics (CO); Multi dimensional scaling; prioritization; risk levels; Risk management program (RMP); Root mean square (r.m.s.); Security technologies; standard information; threat assessment; Risk analysis"

What is more worrying is that small businesses are being attacked more frequently in today's environment. Since protective measures often require significant managerial vigilance, an appropriate level of awareness and concern among managers may be a prerequisite for adequate security protection. Given its importance, there is a need to understand the factors that influence managers' security concerns. Using the Model for Managerial Perceptions of Security Risk as a framework, we explore the factors that influence security concerns of small businesses. Ten technology start-ups in Singapore participated in this study. Findings provide an in-depth understanding of the factors - Organizational Environment, IS Environment and Individual Characteristics. Two new factors that significantly influence managers' concern are identified - Trust between Managers and Employee, and Alignment to Business Needs.

Without an identity service it is impossible to provide the necessary authentication services required to yield session-level confidentiality services, which prevent unauthorized access to information. Providing an identity service is fundamental for securing access to intellectual property, sensitive information and export-controlled data. Within an enterprise's perimeter, it is next to impossible to enforce a ""need-to-know"" access policy to information on a persistent network without some form of an identity service. Modern net-centric Internet Protocol security paradigms use a combination of perimeter-based and application-level security services. Adopting both perimeter and application security services fosters the development of a defense-in-depth strategy for information assurance of automated information systems. [1] Net-centric services such as email, Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/S) and Secure Session Initiation Protocol (SIP/S) have authentication services integrated into themselves, which means that these services frequently provide or sometimes rely on an external identity service. It is not difficult to provide account identity services within an enterprise; however, having the ability to render account identity services across domains requires a minimum level of trust to be established. Most of today's applications have strong dependencies on identity services common to many operating systems. Kerberos, RADIUS, and Diameter provide private Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) or complex Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) using public X.509 certificates are often part of an integrated identity service solution. The emerging requirement for Trusted Third Party (TTP) identification services for distributed M&S is likely to adopt one or more of these technologies. It is unclear at this time which ones should be adopted. However, the identity service adopted will be predominately policy-driven and not technology-driven. Before delving straight into third-party identification services, one must describe a real-world security model adopted by most businesses and the model's core ideas trusted by most enterprises' IT security organizations. Additionally, one must identify existing Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards fitting into this same model while also supporting real-time applications. This paper describes how IETF Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) security services can be leveraged to complement DIS simulations by enabling them to operate in a persistent multi-enterprise environment. This can enable user-authentication in a distributed simulation across multiple enterprises. By adopting support for the SIP protocol, each enterprise can individually protect access to its simulation Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) resources with SIP Network Address Translation (NAT) firewalls and SIP proxy servers. The simulation firewall traversal capabilities described in this paper were demonstrated in a lab environment sponsored by Air Force Integrated Collaborative Environment (AF-ICE) efforts.

Then we propose a novel approach for an efficient intelligent detection and response using ""network quarantine Channels"" (NQCs). The NQC is defined as subnet zones that respond to packets as they are diverted to its hosts for analysis before being permitted into the internal network. The innovative approach includes feedback mechanisms involving adaptive rules, alert filters and policies of the IDS network sensors for various protocols.

Such a language needs to be able to represent causal relations between, and definitions of, various concepts as well as uncertainty with respect to both concepts and relations. To support decision-making properly, the language must also allow the representation of goals and decision alternatives.

Many organizations have worked to provide guidance to those responsible for these critical infrastructure assets, to increase security and reliability from both a physical and electronic access perspective. This paper addresses the new North American Reliability Council (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) requirements, which have replaced the guidelines in the previous NERC Standards 1200 and 1300 on cybersecurity. This paper is a tutorial on how to deploy Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and communications and security technology to satisfy each applicable section of the NERC CIP and reduce the chances of electronic intrusion. Through use of the information in this paper, each entity can begin the process of satisfying internal responsibilities to proactively improve security and strengthen their security posture. These steps include the following: • Understand communications installations and assess security vulnerabilities. • Create and maintain a cybersecurity policy to reduce security vulnerabilities. • Stop all unnecessary communications and block all unnecessary connections. • Encrypt all remote communications. • Pass all remote communications through a communications processor that filters all communications, prevents the introduction of malicious software, prevents the use of ""backdoor passwords,"" and controls the use of EAPs automatically and in response to commanded control. Use this communications processor to detect, alarm, stop, and lock out illegitimate communication. • Choose IEDs that provide communications access warnings for every communications port. • Create security administrator console with visibility and control of security features. • Create an early warning system using integrated new and in-service I/O processors and IEDs for substations, control centers, and engineering access workstations. • Create an engineering access method to collect and view diagnostics and data logs. • Appropriately authenticate all access via passwords, etc. • Place all PCs on secure LANs and configure appropriate NIST security.

Secure, efficient information asset usage lends increasing importance to the integration, protection, analysis, and storage in organisational systems. Information assets are valuable, not least to the individual, and the introduction of legislative and regulatory frameworks, such as the Data Protection Act acknowledges this; it is the duty of organisations to exercise Regulatory Compliance [Idc04, Fisma03, Sox02, Isgi06, and Grsm06], largely understood to be a component of the organisation's information security contexts and Information Lifecycle Management (ILM). Despite the increasing number of publications in security requirements engineering (RE), little or no research has so far taken place in order to address requirements for software systems to which Regulatory Compliance applies. Although a number of security RE approaches appear to offer potential for a solution, we argue that current approaches to security requirements are inadequate when it comes to addressing the issues of organisations as they face the changing legislation and regulation. This position paper also argues the need for a flexible and responsive approach to system RE that properly distinguishes between security and compliance requirements and facilitates the understanding of the overall role of compliance requirements in RE. It calls attention to the potential benefits to be had from the unification of the views of compliance requirements analysis from the standpoints of software RE and of organisational systems. Using Problem Frames, our research is exploring the use of conceptual tools as a foundation to model the impact of compliance requirements, and will lead to a stronger compliance RE framework that allows an organisation to engineer changes to their existing socio-technical systems and to do so in a non-disruptive manner.","","Regulatory compliance; Requirements engineering; Information life cycle management; Legislative and regulatory framework; Organisational systems; Requirements analysis; Security requirements; Security requirements engineering; Sociotechnical systems; University of California; Security of data"

While regular phishing attacks are easily thwarted, designing the attack to include user context information could potentially increase the user's vulnerability. To prevent this, phishing education needs to be considered. In this paper we provide an overview of phishing education, focusing on context aware attacks and introduce a new strategy for educating users by combining phishing IQ tests and class discussions. The technique encompasses displaying both legitimate and fraudulent e-mails to users and having them identify the phishing attempts from the authentic e-mails. Proper implementation of this system helps teach users what to look for in e-mails, and how to protect their confidential information from being caught in the nets of phishers. The strategy was applied in Introduction to Computing courses as part of the computer security component. Class assessment indicates an increased level of awareness and better recognition of attacks.","Computer education; Education; Information security; Phishing","Computer crime; Electronic mail; Teaching; User interfaces; Computer education; Phishing; Phishing education; User context information; Security of data"

Research into the protection of sensitive medical data is often technically focused and does not address information systems and behavioural aspects integral to effective information security implementation. Current information security policy and guidelines are strategically oriented which, whilst relevant to large organisations, are less supportive to smaller enterprises such as primary care practices. Further, the conservative nature of the medical profession has been shown to hinder investigation into information technology use and management, making effective improvement based on research problematical. It is an environment which relies greatly on trust, inhibiting good security practice. Research into how information security practice in this setting can be improved demands an interpretivist approach rather than a positivist one. Action research is one such interpretivist method that allows a creation of scientific knowledge with practical value. Whilst there is some opposition to the action research method on grounds of rigour, its fundamental cyclic process of participation, action and reflection promotes internal rigour and can overcome many of the barriers to research inherent in the primary care medical environment. © 2006 Patricia A H Williams.","Electronic medical records (EMR); General practice; Primary care; Privacy; Risk assessment; Risks; Security","Data privacy; Industrial management; Information technology; Medical computing; Medicine; Risk assessment; Risks; Security of data; Security systems; Action research; Barriers to research; Behavioural aspects; Cyclic process; Electronic medical record; General practice; Information security policies; Information security practice; Information technology use; Medical data; Medical fields; Medical profession; Primary care; Scientific knowledge; Security; Security implementations; Security Practice; Research"

Stringent delay constraints typical of sensor networks suggest that a classical capacity/throughput analysis of the communication infrastructure associated with a sensor network may not offer an accurate assessment of overall performance. Rather, the allocation of system resources should be carefully crafted to optimize overall system performance. This work explores the potential benefits of a cross-layer design in the context of detection over sensor networks. The allocation of system resources is considered and overall performance for sensor systems subject to hard delay constraints is analyzed. A continuous-time Markov model is introduced to capture the unreliable nature of wireless connections. Based on this model, a sensor equivalent single-server queue is introduced and an overall performance metric is proposed. Numerical results suggest that substantial gains are possible through cross-layer optimization. A queueing-aware architecture outperforms both the instantaneous transmission model common to the decentralized detection literature and the throughput maximization approach often favored by the sensor network community. The performance evaluation methods presented in this paper provides an elegant framework to quantify the amount of physical resources necessary to achieve a desired performance level at the fusion center. More importantly, this research underscores the importance of a global system-theoretic view in the design of real-time applications over sensor networks.","","Ad hoc networks; Computer architecture; Decision making; Detectors; Hybrid sensors; Markov processes; Network architecture; Optimization; Problem solving; Sensor data fusion; Sensors; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Communication infrastructures; Continuous-time (CT); Cross layer designs; Cross layer optimizations; Decentralized detection; Delay constraints; Fusion center (FC); Information assurance (IA); Markov modelling; Network communities; Numerica l results; Overall performance; Performance evaluation (PE); Performance level (PL); Physical resources; Potential benefits; Real-time applications; Sensor systems; Single-server queue; System performances; System resources; Throughput maximization; Transmission models; Wireless connections; Wireless sensors; Sensor networks"

The successful deployment of these electronic systems for ecommerce, Internet banking, government online services, VPNs, mobile commerce, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), etc., is dependent on the effectiveness of the security solutions. These security concerns are further compounded when resource-constrained environments and real-time speed requirements have to be considered in next-generation applications. Consequently, these IT security issues have been a subject of intensive research in areas of computing, networking and cryptography these last few years. This paper presents the design and implementation of a crypto processor, a special-purpose embedded system optimized for the execution of cryptographic algorithms in hardware. This cryptosystem can be used in wide range of electronic devices, which include PCs, PDAs, wireless handsets, smart cards, hardware security modules, network appliances, such as routers, gateways, firewalls, storage and web servers. The proposed crypto processor consists of a 32-bit RISC processor block and several IP cores that accelerates private and public key crypto computations, LZSS data compression, SHA-1 hashing, and wide-operand modular arithmetic computation. These dedicated crypto IP cores, which are implemented as coprocessors, permit high-speed execution of the compute-intensive operations in AES encryption, ECC and RSA-based digital signature, and other PKI-enabling functions. The proposed embedded system is designed using SoC technology, with hardware described in VHDL and the embedded software coded in C.

Heretofore, schemes of private key sharing based on channel characteristics have been proposed for countcrmeasure against eavesdropper in radio communication systems using carrier modulation. However, it is generally difficult to apply the existing schemes to UWB systems where no carrier is used. In order to resolve the problem, a private key sharing scheme suitable for UWB systems was proposed. In the scheme, measurement accuracy of the arrival time difference decreases in the low SN ratio area. Therefore, in this paper, a new measurement method of the arrival time difference at both authorized radio station is proposed. Computer simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in wireless PAN environments. The results of the computer simulations show that the proposed scheme can achieve 100% key agreement with the 3 bits error correction technique at signal-to-noise ratio of about 21dB.","Information security; Multipath time delay; Private key sharing; Ultra wideband; Wireless PAN","Broadband networks; Computer simulation; Cryptography; Security of data; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless networks; Multipath time delay; Private key sharing; Ultra wideband systems; Multipath propagation"

Their usage has significantly increased in ecommerce applications since their introduction. Because of their wide usage, security in web services has become an important point of interest for many. User data provided by users during their transactions with online web services can be stolen and illegally used. Thus web service providers have started to strengthen security. This can lead to lack of user privacy. Privacy has received relatively less attention during the growth of information technology. User privacy management needs to be both from the user side and from web application side. User awareness about information security is the factor for user side privacy management.

In order to keep usability and achieve safety, we have exploited ubiquitous cryptography named RAC (random numberaddressing cryptography). This is an innovative common key technique and has more promising performance than block cipher like DES and AES. Although RAC can be run on any platform, a dedicated processor is more preferable in order to achieve sufficient speed, performance, and strength in the cryptographic streaming of large quantity of ubiquitous information. In order to distinguish these features without deteriorating media processing, we have developed a ubiquitous processor named HCgorilla and its software support. It is a single chip multimedia mobile processor unified sophisticated features of RAC and processor techniques useful for low power, high throughput, and Java. The system combined HCgorilla and the software support works well for media processing as well as ubiquitous cryptography. © 2006 IEEE.","","Computer networks; International symposium; Media processing; Software support; Cryptography"

The systems are used for identification and tracking of equipment, staff and patients. There has been little public comment or analysis of these systems with regard to privacy as their implementation has been driven by security issues. The systems that gather this information include video, smart card and more recently RFID systems. The system applications include tracking of vital equipment, labelling of blood and other samples, tracking of patients, new born babies and staff. These applications generate a vast amount of digital information that needs to be correctly secured to protect the privacy of the individual. Separately each type of information has value, but if this information were analysed together then the intelligence that can be gleaned from this could become a major threat to privacy and security. There are various standards and legislation that cover healthcare information, such as CCTV, but are these known and what are the compliance levels? RFID use is increasing in the hospital sector and this is being linked with the patient medical record as it is becoming core to treatment in some hospitals. The indications are that this will become normal practice which means that surveillance information from RFID systems will be linked much more closely to a patient's medical record. Managers, owners and custodians of information within hospitals need to be aware of the issues and take steps to ensure that staff are fully aware and trained in information handling practices. They also need to ensure that external parties who handle surveillance information are compliant with standards and good practice. © 2006 Sue Kennedy.","Electronic surveillance; Information security; Ownership; Privacy; RFID (radio frequency ID)","Data privacy; Health care; Industrial management; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Regulatory compliance; Security of data; Security systems; Smart cards; Digital information; Electronic surveillance; Electronic surveillance systems; Good practices; Information handling; Medical record; Ownership; Privacy and security; Radio frequencies; RFID systems; Security issues; Surveillance information; System applications; Hospitals"

The risks in cybersecurity are increasing rapidly in our country. Because the cybersecurity defense and computer crime investigation system of our government and businesses have been threatened, the damage of cybercrime for the national security and public security will be more critical, even more than the violence crime and economic crime. The national cyber forensics mechanism and laboratory will play a very crucial role in dealing with cybercrime. In 2003 our government conducted a research of digital evidence, the standard procedure of operation and cyber forensic laboratory. It included the organization, training, technical capability, legislation and operation procedures. In 2004 the government made a policy to build the first nationwide cyber security and forensic laboratory. B It will be one of the major cybersecurity defense mechanisms in our country. Our bureau (MJIB) had made a plan and got the additional budget to build a cyber forensic lab this year[1]. This study has four aspects: 1. The study of reliable cyber forensic software and hardware. 2. The standard of operating procedure of cyber forensics. 3. The training courses for examiner, including the internationally well-known certification system in cyber forensics. 4. The study of certification of cyber forensic laboratory. Cyber forensics is still at its early stage in Taiwan. More professional cyber forensic manpower is needed, as well as a certified cyber forensic mechanism. It is expected that cyber forensic will become increasingly important for cybersecurity policy[1] and management in the future. Hence, building a certificated laboratory and establishing the SOP of cyber forensics from this study can be a basis to cultivate cyber forensic capability in our country. In this way the law enforcement will get more help from our laboratory. The laboratory through its operation also enhances the ability of Taiwan's cyber forensic professionals and provides more convincing digital evidence in the court.

This technique is termed Higher Order Path Analysis (HOPA) and focuses on the discovery of patterns in higher order paths in supervised learning datasets.

In this paper, we have developed a policy-oriented decision model based on object trust management to assist users in selecting reliable and secure information in an open system. In the proposed model, an object represents a topic or issue under discussion, and it may have multiple versions, each of which represents a subject's opinion towards the characteristics of that object. The developed trust-based decision model assists a user to select one object version with desired level of quality and security features from available versions of a given object. The model balances both positive and negative aspects of an object version, and an evaluator can explicitly specify, in form of a policy specification, which features of an object version are not acceptable and which features are favorable. A high-level policy language, called Selector, expresses the policy specification in an unambiguous way. Selector consists of primary and residual policy statements. It supports recursive function calls, and the invoked external functions are defined separately from the language itself. The proposed decision model doesn't guarantee to select the ""best"" version for a given object. Rather it ensures that the selected version meets a user's requirement for information integrity.","Information integrity; Information security policies; Policy language; Trust decision model; Trustworthy computation",""

In addition, the desired task-performing activity is modeled with another graph describing the required communications. Then, a few variants of the task assignment problem are formulated with potentially conflicting objectives (or constraints) of load balancing and communication costs. For some of these variants this paper provides efficient algorithms that solve the assignment problem.

It allows a correct data fusion and dissemination by the end-users, in the presence of content corruptions and/or timing failures that may possibly occur during data collection. Two key elements are required of the voting functionality: i) fielding asynchronously generated real-time or near-real-time data, and ii) handling large sized non-numeric data sets with problem-specific interpretations -e.g., terrain images from radar stations. Under the constraints (i) and (ii), we describe a highly asynchronous voting service to effect a timely and low-overhead delivery of data to the users. The paper analyzes the service-level properties of a voting machinery to meet the stringent needs of IA applications. The externally visible properties are prescribed in terms of 'safety' and 'liveness' requirements of the underlying voting protocols that reflect the application-specific data integrity and availability constraints. When voting is provided as a middleware service, an application designer may prescribe the necessary service-level parameters: the level of resiliency and the performance aspects of data delivery. © 2006 IEEE.","","Data acquisition; Data structures; Information dissemination; Middleware; Quality of service; Radar stations; Real time systems; Asynchronous voting service; Replica processes; Replica voting; Voting protocols; Information services"

To resolve the above shortcoming and enhance the applicability of risk analysis method to the network security problem, a new hierarchical fuzzy risk assessment method is proposed. In the proposed method, a fuzzy weighted average method is presented to calculate the fuzzy risk value on the basis of the hierarchical security structures, and the ROG-based similarity measure of generalized fuzzy numbers is used to create a complete linguistic approximation model for the network security risks.

Taking virus contagion as an example, the negative investment externality exerted by the contagion between firms in the network was investigated. Under such an environment, the investment threshold and factors concerned such as contagion probability and the number of investing firms were computed to determine several Nash equilibrium solutions with externality representing the risk. The model was analyzed further when the risk was endogenous and the invest threshold was much more complicated than that in exogenous environment. This endogenous threshold is determined not only by the probability of contagion between firms but also by the sign and absolute value of externalities. This method provides a novel viewpoint to information security risk management and advices for firms' decision on security investment and government policies to induce investment under externality.","Game theory; Interconnection networks; Investments; Security of data","Game theory; Interconnection networks; Investments; Probability; Risk management; Information security; Security investment; Security of data"

Formalised in the 1990s, it has not seen the take up of accreditations that could be expected from looking at accreditation figures for other standards such as the ISO 9000 series. This paper examines why this may be the case by investigating what has driven the accreditation under the standard in 18 UK companies, representing a fifth of companies accredited at the time of the research. An initial literature review suggests that adoption could be driven by external pressures, or simply an objective of improving operational performance and competitive performance. It points to the need to investigate the influence of Regulators and Legislators, Competitors, Trading Partners and Internal Stakeholders on the decision to seek accreditation. An inductive analysis of the reasons behind adoption of accreditation and its subsequent benefits suggests that competitive advantage is the primary driver of adoption for many of the companies we interviewed. We also find that an important driver of adoption is that the standard enabled organisations to access best practice in Information Security Management thereby facilitating external relationships and communication with internal stakeholders. Contrary to the accepted orthodoxy and what could be expected from the literature, increased regulation and the need to comply with codes of practice are not seen as significant drivers for companies in our sample.","Adoption; Best practice; BS 7799; Information security; ISO/IEC 17799; ISO/IEC 27001",""

In a designated-verifier signature the verifier is restrictive. The characteristics of proxy signatures and designated-verifier signatures are combined. Using the Schnorr signature scheme based on DLP, a designated-verifier proxy signature scheme is presented. The new scheme satisfies the security properties of both proxy signature schemes and designated-verifier signature schemes.

Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before they are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network. Since the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious attackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important. A witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this approach, the base station receives the fusion data and ""votes"" on the data from a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes, called as ""witnesses,"" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the base station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could forge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the vote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires more bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base station. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the witness-based approach using direct voting mechanism. The witness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a problem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the vote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times better overhead than the witness-based approach. © 2006 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Data transfer; Information retrieval; Telecommunication networks; Base station; Data fusion; Malicious attack; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems"

This elusive goal has been a major driver for information security for over three decades. Recently, the need for secure information sharing has dramatically increased with the explosion of the Internet and the convergence of outsourcing, offshoring and B2B collaboration in the commercial arena and the real-world demonstration of the tragic consequences of lack of information sharing in the national security arena. As technology has made the ""share"" aspect, ever easier so has it increased the difficulty of enforcing the ""protect."" aspect. The central contribution of this paper is to show that the emergence of industrial, strength Trusted Computing (TO) technology offers a range of novel solutions to the long-standing problem of secure information sharing. To this end we introduce a new framework of three layered models to analyze requirements and develop solutions, and demonstrate the application of this framework in context of TC and secure information sharing. The three layers are policy models (topmost), enforcement models (middle), and implementation models (bottom). Hence the name PEI models. At the policy model layer the secure information sharing space is divided into three categories called password based, device based, and credential based. For each of these policy categories various enforcement and implementation models can be developed. While we believe the PEI framework is relevant to security problems beyond secure information sharing, our goal in this paper is to demonstrate its application in this particular arena and identify questions for future research in this context. An essential, benefit of PEI is that the three layers allow us to focus on the more important issues at a higher level of abstraction at the policy and enforcement layers, while leaving deep detail to the implementation layer. This paper focusses on the policy and enforcement layers with only passing mention of the implementation layer.

However, without reliable estimates on attack probabilities, risk management is difficult to do in practice. Using a novel data set, we provide estimates on attack propensity and how it changes with disclosure and patching of vulnerabilities. Disclosure of software vulnerability has been controversial. On one hand are those who propose full and instant disclosure whether the patch is available or not and on the other hand are those who argue for limited or no disclosure. Which of the two policies is socially optimal depends critically on how attack frequency changes with disclosure and patching. In this paper, we empirically explore the impact of vulnerability information disclosure and availability of patches on attacks targeting the vulnerability. Our results suggest that on an average both secret (non-published) and published (published and not patched) vulnerabilities attract fewer attacks than patched (published and patched) vulnerabilities. When we control for time since publication and patches, we find that patching an already known vulnerability decreases the number of attacks, although attacks gradually increase with time after patch release. Patching an unknown vulnerability, however, causes a spike in attacks, which then gradually decline after patch release. Attacks on secret vulnerabilities slowly increase with time until the vulnerability is published and then attacks rapidly decrease with time after publication. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.","Disclosure policy; Economics; Patching; Risk management; Software vulnerability","Computer software; Economic and social effects; Information analysis; Risk management; Security of data; Disclosure policy; Patching; Software vulnerability; Computer crime"

This chapter focuses on employing and utilizing of inherent chaotic features in a nonlinear dynamical system in a useful manner. When it comes to employing deterministic chaos, there are tremendous advantages such as low-energy consumption, robustness of the controller performance, information security, and simplicity of employing chaos whenever it has chaotic attractive features in the original systems itself. If the original system does not have chaotic properties, deterministic chaos will be introduced to the system. Keeping these objectives, the control algorithm is constructed in order to control nonlinear systems, which exhibit chaotic behavior. We introduce two phases of control: First phase uses open-loop control forming a chaotic attractor or using chaotic inherent features in a system itself. Fuzzy model based controller is employed under state feedback control in the second phase of control. The Henon map and the three-dimensional Lorenz attractor, which have chaotic attractive features in their original systems, are taken into consideration so as to utilize the benefits of chaos. Then, a two-link manipulator is considered to illustrate the design procedure with employing deterministic chaos.

Surprisingly, no single database currently brings together all the various kinds of data from the vulnerability sites. Of particular interest to us was author and discoverer information since this provides valuable information about who is active in information security and occasionally might indicate the authors of exploits; current databases do not connect this to other relevant information. We found that the searchable parameters of the existing vulnerability databases were limited and inconsistent. Consequently, it is very difficult to get complete information about computer vulnerabilities by searching Web sites. Our approach was to bring together this information into a composite database. We did automated data collection from the existing Web vulnerability databases by creating Web bots that traversed Web sites and retrieved selected information from them, then imported the collected Web data into a relational database. A browser provides Web-based access to this database. [1] and [2] shows how such information can be used to build models of attacks in the form of graphs, trees, and finite-state machines, and thereby develop methods for system protection. We first wanted to use the Carnegie-Mellon US-CERT database (www.kb.cert.org/vuls) of 22,716 vulnerabilities from 1995. However, it is not downloadable online. So we took records from the Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) database (cve.mitre.org) with 15,000 entries, 11,000 entries from Secunia (www.secunia.com), 1,500 entries from US-CERT Vulnerability Notes Database (www.kb.cert.org/vuls) and 15,000 from SecurityFocus, more a newsgroup reporting vulnerabilities (www.securityfocus.com/bid). The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (nvd.nist.gov) contained mostly the same information as the CVE database in an XML format, and the Open Source Vulnerabilities Database (www.osvdb.org) appeared to duplicate most of the other information, so we did not use their data. Each database had its weaknesses. The US-CERT database could not be downloaded as a whole, only in small groups of records; the CVE database did not list discoverers or reporters of vulnerabilities; the Secunia and SecurityFocus databases did not contain data on all vulnerability alerts and candidates, and their vulnerability descriptions were often cryptic. Using ideas from [3], we created bots that collected information from the Web sources. These used crafted links to access forms pages and then processed the results in Java. Only the CVE database provided an easy means to download their database. The US-CERT Vulnerability Notes Database does not allow bots to search the database except by vulnerability number, and this appears randomly assigned from 1000 to 999999; so we manually grabbed the 54 pages of information containing vulnerability identifiers and iteratively searched for those with a bot. The Secunia database could be indexed by entry number ranging from 1 to 13000 with some omissions, so we just retrieved all 13000, getting blank pages for the omissions; however, some entries had no numbers and could not be found this way. Finally, we retrieved the SecurityFocus database pages in the same manner as Secunia, again getting some blank pages for nonexistent numbers. For each of these databases we analyzed the formats to develop ways to extract and organize the data on the page. We created a relational database using PostgreSQL, using character fields for each of the pieces of information extracted from the websites. Each site had a separate table for its data of 4000-15000 records. Text had to be cleaned up in a number of ways before entering it into this database, including conversion from HTML to strings, from strings to SQL char fields, from SQL char fields to strings, and from strings to HTML. There were also many small problems with non-English, Unicode, and punctuation characters, as well as the handling of a few large text entries. We created a Java servlet for free-text keyword search on the database. It can search on vulnerability name, author, CVE number, or affected system. These keyword searches are then coded into SQL and passed to the database. Selections, projections, and joins are made on our tables as necessary to produce the results. Currently, results are returned as tables, one for each of the selected source sites (Figure 1). Posing questions, like what percentage of vulnerability notices have a CVE number associated with them, involved some challenges in structuring the proper queries in SQL. These were fairly large tables and performing queries with join operations, such as finding data unique to one table, were prohibitively slow on a laptop computer. The CVE vulnerability numbers were quite helpful, since a vulnerability was often described quite differently by each organization. In seeking author or credit information, we found many entries of the Secunia site to state ""no credit."" Redesigning the Secunia bot to recursively search referenced advisories from those that provided no credit information reduced the number of ""no credit"" items from 40% to 15%. Interestingly, while the total number of vulnerabilities has been increasing since 1999, Mitre (the keeper of the CVE database) has labeled fewer candidate vulnerabilities (Figure 2). Another discovery was that the security-company data collection was not capturing the volume of vulnerabilities reported by the USCERT (Figure 3). Also of note is that individuals and private firms are critical to discovering vulnerabilities, since in both the Secunia and the SecurityFocus databases over 70% of the vulnerabilities were not found by the manufacturer of the software or hardware. Though not complete, this project has achieved most of its goals in collecting, storing, and accessing the computer-vulnerability database information from the Web. Even now, our system can provide some interesting data not easily gleaned from the Web. Comparisons between the commercial and the government sites will also prove interesting. Further development of the project would yield some answers about the timeliness of vendors in issuing resolution to problems, trends in systems vulnerabilities in contrast to competitors, identifying trends in authoring and submission of vulnerabilities, and measure how well the CVE naming convention for vulnerabilities is being used and applied. © 2006 IEEE.","","Data acquisition; Data mining; Information retrieval; Security of data; Web browsers; World Wide Web; Composite database; Data collection; Vulnerability database; Web-based access; Relational database systems"

This variability can be a function of the real-time SA/COP data, thus allowing it to dynamically respond to the operational events, in the near real-time.

The traditional method of conducting a risk analysis is technology-driven and has several shortcomings. First, its focus on technology is at the detriment of considering people and processes as significant sources of security risk. Second, an analysis driven by technical assets can be overly time-consuming and costly. Third, the traditional risk analysis method employs calculations based largely on guesswork to estimate probability and financial loss of a security breach. Finally, an IT-centric approach to security risk analysis does not involve business users to the extent necessary to identify a comprehensive set of risks, or to promote security-awareness throughout an organization. This paper proposes an alternative, holistic method to conducting risk analysis. A holistic risk analysis, as defined in this paper, is one that attempts to identify a comprehensive set of risks by focusing equally on technology, information, people, and processes. The method is driven by critical business processes, which provides focus and relevance to the analysis. Key aspects of the method include a business-driven analysis, user participation in the analysis, architecture and data flow diagrams as a means to identify relevant IT assets, risk scenarios to capture procedural and security details, and qualitative estimation. The mixture of people and tools involved in the analysis is expected to result in a more comprehensive set of identified risks and a significant increase in security awareness throughout the organization.","Business process; Data flow diagram; Information security; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risk scenario",""
