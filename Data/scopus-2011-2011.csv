Cyber terrorism in public is usually referred and is mostly mistaken for classic attacks on information systems. The cyber terrorism can with minimal effort and knowledge cause terrible consequences and threaten existence of every organization. Methods and techniques of such attacks do not differ from the operation of the classic information security threats. However, the terroristic attack strives to political and social changes in order to spread fear among general public. The most common attacks are pointed on information systems in critical infrastructure. The consequences of the terroristic attack on the organization's information system are mostly economical damage, employees' injuries or even death. The protection against such cyber threat is therefore necessary; however how it depends on every individual organization. With results explanations, gathered with interviews in Slovenian organizations we are able to learn about problems of understanding cyber terrorism as a threat and to properly adjust to the changes.","Cyber terrorism; Information security; Managing the threats; Risks; Threats","Cybernetics; Information systems; Risks; Security of data; Classic information; Cyber terrorism; Cyber threats; Economical damage; General publics; Managing the threats; Social changes; Threats; Terrorism"

Merely installing the software and performing a ""short list"" verification activity is insufficient-actual ""hands on"" execution of the software is needed-and when this can be done in a simulated live environment-a higher confidence level can be extended to the application target of evaluation (TOE) for implementation. This task is daunting not because of the nature of the testing-but of the need to setup and subsequently tear-down systems to participate in the performance of these tests. Fortunately-there are tools and techniques for testing application security-using a reduced set of hardware and yet maintaining operational fidelity. Virtual Machines (VM)'s and virtual networkenvironments (team architectures) offer a method for providing this level of testing confidence while allowing for a greater variety of tests and test participant systems. This paper presents a series of architectures and scenarios proposed to implement such a testing environment that retains the viability (and fidelity) of a 'real-world' network environment while providing an isolated and restricted test and analysis area. This is shown through a series of scenarios and VM Team setups (scenario players) in a virtual machine based environment. This approach allows a number of benefits: Isolation of the testing environment Focus on the Target of Evaluation (TOE) for testing Capture and provide metrics on tool and technique usage and impact Provide limits and mitigation of risk and liability issues for the TOE The VM environment also offers a unique opportunity to simulate interactions between various known systems under test (TOE)'s in a 'replicated' environment. A set of proposed scenarios and an environmental architecture, including toolsets and targets of evaluation (TOE) systems is proposed. The applicability of the VM 'team' systems approach is discussed through a suite of scenarios designed to illustrate ystem evaluation, monitoring, and detection.","Information assurance; Software assurance; Software testing; Virtual systems","Application programs; Network architecture; Network security; Testing; Verification; Virtual machine; Assessment technique; Confidence levels; Information assurance; Security assessment; Software assurance; Software testings; Testing environment; Tools and techniques; Virtual systems; Virtual team; Software testing"

However, the physical layer continues to be without any protection from signal privacy attacks and anonymity of attacker within the WLAN, and it has no solution in the standard. The MAC layer, too, has not quite achieved the confidence of the networking community at the level of IPsec as of yet. In this paper, we present the results of a study that looks at the IEEE 802.11-2007 MAC security in juxtaposition to IPsec. We thus compare the attacks that can be thwarted by IEEE 802.11-2007 MAC as well as IPsec and the manners in which they can be thwarted by each security layer. The results can be used to propose enhancements to the IEEE 802.11-2007 MAC layer in order for it to gain the same level of confidence as obtained by IPsec. The purpose is not to choose between IPsec and IEEE 802.11-2007 security (as both are required at different layers), rather it is to help understand what could be added to the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard to make it as secure as IPsec. © 2011 SIMULATION COUNCILS, INC.","Information assurance; IPsec; WiFi; WLANs","Mobile security; Security of data; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Different layers; Distribution mechanism; Information assurance; IPsec; Networking community; Privacy Attacks; Security layers; WLANs; IEEE Standards"

Increasingly, an organization's ability to protect information assets plays a critical role in its ability to meet regulatory compliance requirements, increase customer trust, preserve brand strength or company reputation, maintain business resiliency, and thereby enhance organizational performance. As information technologies, global connectedness, and business requirements continue to evolve at a fast pace, organizations must recognize the importance of implementing an overall information security strategy to protect business information asset from increasingly sophisticated threats. Given the dynamic level of business environments, the identification and understanding of the required capabilities to deliver an information security strategy becomes the key success factor. At the strategic level, organizations must be able to answer the question, ""What are the minimum essential organizational capabilities required to support effective planning and execution of an overall information security strategy that best achieves organizational objectives and gains competitive advantage?"" The aim of this study is to contribute to the body of knowledge about the organizational aspect of information security. It seeks to examine the issue of information security from the perspective of organizational capabilities. Based on strategic management and information security literature, this perspective suggests that organizational capabilities moderate the relationship between information security strategy implementation success and organization performance. A theoretical model is proposed and validated to demonstrate this relationship changes as a function of organizational capabilities. The organizational capabilities considered here consist of the ability to develop high quality situational awareness and understanding of the internal and external environments, the ability to collaborate, make and communicate decisions, the ability to possess appropriate means and resources to respond, along with the ability to coordinate and deploy organizational assets. A structural equation modeling approach is used to quantitatively analyze data and to test the validity of the research hypotheses. Results from this study are expected to yield practical value for business leaders and to provide a basis for understanding the viable predisposition of an organization in the context of information security as it competes in today's challenging marketplace.","Competitive advantage; Effective implementation; Information security strategy; Organization performance; Organizational capabilities; Structural equation modeling","Commerce; Information systems; Information use; Regulatory compliance; Security of data; Strategic planning; Competitive advantage; Critical business; Effective implementation; Information assets; Information security strategy; Modeling analyzes; Organization performance; Organizational capabilities; Security strategies; Structural equation models; Competition"

As such, information warfare is a critical topic for future military members to comprehend. Many schools teach topics in computer security, information assurance, and information warfare through a variety of formats. At the Air Force Academy, we have taught a Computer Security and Information Warfare course for several years to prepare future officers for the realities of modern conflict. In the past, our course has had two primary focuses: fundamental concepts in the theory of computer security delivered primarily through lecture, and a hands-on laboratory component to gain practice in current offensive and defensive tools and techniques. As we have evolved the course, we have added other components to the course such as virtual labs, web labs, competitions, and a research project. In addition to be motivational to the students, this hybrid approach has been successful in engaging students who do not have a strong background in computer science. Web labs have been especially helpful in providing a realistic hands-on experience without going into the tremendous amount of detail and background that surround modern computer and network systems. The competition we have introduced is unique from other university level cyber competitions in its design and format. The research project attempts to expose students to a complete research experience. The combination of these elements serves as an active learning approach to teaching students critical topics in IW. We have also had success employing them outside of the classroom to a broad range of students in a summer program. This paper will describe traditional approaches, our environment, the hybrid approach we use, our experience with it, and future plans.","Computer; Education; Security","Laboratories; Security of data; Security systems; Teaching; Air Force Academy; Fundamental concepts; Hands-on laboratories; Hybrid approach; Information assurance; Information information; Information warfare; Laboratory components; Security; Theory of computers; Students"

Chaos as a tool for information security is gaining wide acceptance for its inherent simplicity and ability to secure a communication link from the physical layer compared to other application layer-software encryption methods. Though they are lesser secured than the physical layer systems, the software techniques are still the order of the day. Since the physical layer techniques are still in the nascent stages of growth, this paper tries to go one step further, to utilise the chaotic scheme in securing optical communication. The idea is to generate a chaotic signal in the form of current and adding it to the message at the transmitter where the whole of this current drives an optical source-laser. At the receiver the same chaos signal is generated by prior synchronization. The received signal is photodetected to get the equivalent current. The difference between this current and the internally generated matched chaos yields the message. The efficiency of this technique is investigated for line of sight communication by modelling a free space optic channel (FSO) and accounting for attenuation caused by the same. © Indian Society for Education and Environment (iSee).","Chaos; Cryptography; Secure optical communication",""

This warning message is needed because of personal information and knowledge transfer from desktop PCs to mobile devices that are connected to wireless networks of different sizes and importance. The transfer brings along the adjustment of the traditional information security threats to the mobile environment, as well as the emergence of new characteristic dangers. Moreover, our presence as individuals on Web 2.0 widens the danger area even more. The problems solved here are of interest both for each of us, as individuals, and for the organisations managers-especially in a world in which the borderline between the work hours and the personal life is becoming more and more difficult to draw, and we can even discuss the PIM and PKM in an organisational context.","Mobile networks; Mobile threats; Personal information management; Personal knowledge management; Web 2.0 security threats","Competition; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personal communication systems; Security of data; Security systems; Wireless networks; World Wide Web; Information security threats; Knowledge transfer; Mobile environments; Mobile threats; Personal information; Personal information management; Personal knowledge management; Security threats; Knowledge management"

The information security risk management (ISRM) is the process that identifies the threats and vulnerabilities of an enterprise information system, evaluates the likelihood of their occurrence and estimates their potential business impact. It is a continuous process that allows cost effectiveness of implemented security controls and provides a dynamic set of tools to monitor the security level of the information system. However, the examination of existing practices of the enterprises reveals a poor effectiveness of information security management processes such as stated in the information security breaches surveys. In particular, the enterprises experience difficulties in assessing and managing their security risks, in implementing appropriate security controls, as well as in preventing security threats. The available ISRM models and frameworks mainly focus on the technical modules related to the development of security mitigation and prevention and do not pay much attention to the influence of business variables affecting the reliability of the provided solutions. This paper discusses the major business related factors for risk analysis and shows their interference in the ISRM process. These factors include the enterprise strategic environment, the organizational structure features, the customer relationship and the value chain configuration. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","","Mobile telecommunication systems; Public relations; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Business continuity; Customer relationships; Enterprise information system; Information security managements; Information security risk analysis; Information security risk managements; Organizational structures; Threats and vulnerabilities; Information systems"

Inability to provide a secure communication method, giving local/global protection is affecting inter-professional communications and hindering sharing among MDT members. This research aims to facilitate a secure collaborative environment enabling persistent control over shared information across boundaries of the organisations that own the data. This paper is based on the early stages of the research and its results will feed into following stages. It looks at the structure of a healthcare system to understand the types of inter-professional communication and information exchange that occur in practice. Additionally it presents an initial assessment identifying the Information Security (IS) needs and challenges faced in providing persistent control in a shared collaborative environment by using conceptual modelling of a selected medical scenario (breast cancer in Wales). The results show that a considerable number of professionals are involved in a patient's treatment. Each plays a well-defined role, but often uses different Healthcare Information Systems (HIS) to store sensitive and confidential patient medical information. These HIS cannot provide secure multi-organisational informationsharing to support collaboration among the MDT members. This causes inter-professional communication issues among team members that inhibit decision-making using the information. The findings from this study show how to improve information support from HIS stored information for MDT members. Also the resulting IS functions will be described which facilitate establishing secure collaborative environments guaranteeing persistent control over shared information.","Information security; Information sharing; Information system; Multi-disciplinary team; Persistent control; Secure collaborative environment","Decision making; Indium compounds; Information dissemination; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Patient treatment; Professional aspects; Security of data; Collaborative environments; Information sharing; Inter professionals; Multidisciplinary teams; Organisational; Persistent control; Professional communication; Secure collaborative environment; Shared information; Team members; Information use"

Our case data shows that many insiders who stole IP did so within 30 days of their termination. Based on this insight, this pattern helps reduce that risk through increased monitoring of departing insiders during their last 30 days of employment. The increased monitoring suggested by the pattern is above and beyond what might be required for a baseline organizational detection of potentially malicious insider actions. Future work will develop a library of enterprise architectural patterns for mitigating the insider threat based on the data we have collected. Our goal is for organizational resilience to insider threat to emerge from repeated application of patterns from the library. © Copyright 2011 Carnegie Mellon University.","Cyber security; Enterprise architecture; Information assurance; Information security; Insider threat; Organizational pattern; Security pattern","Industry; Intellectual property; Security of data; Cyber security; Enterprise Architecture; Information assurance; Insider Threat; Organizational pattern; Security patterns; Crime"

In addition, there are arguments that RSA's strong ties with China could place it at high risk of cyber war attacks. Presently because of very low broadband penetration in South Africa and in Africa, chances of it being used to launch attacks to other countries are limited. However, the fact that it will be hosting the 2010 FIFA World Cup increases the vulnerabilities as was experienced with previous soccer world cups in other countries. In either case there are national security implications associated with an increase in broadband access. In addition the compromised PC's of citizens could in future be used as a hub for launching cyber warfare type attacks on the rest of the world. This in turn will pose a national security threat not only to South Africa but also to the rest of the world. The central argument in this paper is that the exponential increase in internet broadband will result in an increase in security threats that will also take the battlefield to the home of the average citizen in rural South Africa. The paper adopts an argumentative analytical approach with the intention to sensitise all nations on issues of national security. We draw on the South African case to demonstrate the potential impact on South Africa that could follow the planned increase in broadband access in Africa as well as on the average RSA citizen. A national security generic framework is used to analyse these threats and the impact on the average citizen.

As our dependency grows so do the threats that target our military C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), as well as the operational components and electronic controls for our critical infrastructure. During our collaborative research one individual proclaimed it C8ISR. (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat systems, Collaboration, Coordination, Code, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) Given the U.S. military is the most modern, computerized force in the world, the challenge of cyber defense is far greater than for any other military in the world. Over the past decade we have experienced a substantial rise in the complexity and sophistication of cyber attacks, as well as a frightening increase in the impact of some of the attacks. Every computer is a potential cyber weapon waiting to be loaded and used by extremists, criminals, terrorists and rogue nation states. As the world becomes more and more dependent on computers and information technology, the greater the risk of cyber attacks. Government and military leaders now face this fact and our critical systems and infrastructure remain at great risk! This risk has made the ability to defend these critical systems and wage cyber attacks core capabilities required for the modern military. In the age of cyber conflict, leaders need to understand the weapons and strategies used to wage this rapidly evolving type of warfare. Public and private cooperation is not critical, it is essential if these threats are going to be addressed and proper safeguards put in place to protect the critical infrastructure from increasingly hostile cyber attacks. The realities associated with the threat of cyber conflict are beginning to set in after the attacks on Estonia, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan. The recent attacks over the July 4th holiday on the United States and South Korea have reinforced the need for immediate action and part of that action is education. Cyber warfare is now viewed as a component of a comprehensive national security strategy rather than a standalone option. It is paramount that the military, intelligence agencies, government leaders, and the homeland security community develop an appropriate doctrine to systematically and appropriately counter the threat of cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. This presentation is designed to introduce participants to the current threat environment and the current state of cyber vulnerabilities, cyber weapons and a framework for addressing cyber weapons.","Cyber warfare; espionage; strategies; terrorism; weaponry","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; National security; Network security; Public works; Security systems; Terrorism; Wages; 'current; Command control; Control communications; Critical systems; Cyber warfare; Cyber-attacks; Espionage; Networks and systems; Strategy; Weaponry; Critical infrastructures"

Risk analysis is a challenging process especially when the topic is information security. Today, a number of methods and tools are available for information security risk analysis. The hard task is to use the best fit for the certification. In this work we have proposed a process based risk analysis method which is suitable for ISO/IEC 27001:2005 certifications. Our risk analysis method allows the participation of staff to the determination of the scope and provides a good fit for the certification process. The proposed method has been conducted for an organization and the results of the applications are shared with the audience. The proposed collaborative risk analysis method allows for the participation of staff and managers while still being manageable in a timely manner to uncover crucial information security risks.","Flow chart; Information security; ISO/IEC 27001:2005; Process approach; Risk analysis","Human resource management; Information management; ISO Standards; Risk assessment; Security of data; Certification process; Collaborative process; Flow charts; Information security managements; ISO/IEC; ISO/IEC 27001:2005; Process approach; Process-based; Risk analysis methods; Security management systems; Risk analysis"

Humans are increasingly seen as the weak link in information security defences and attackers are starting to prefer exploiting human factors such as greed, curiosity and respect for authority. Problems with human behaviour in an information security context are assumed to be caused by a lack of facts available to the audience. Awareness therefore is largely treated as the broadcast of facts to an audience in the hope that behaviour improves. There is a tendency for technical experts in the field of information security to tell people what they think they ought to know (and may in fact already know). This ""technocratic"" view of risk communication is fundamentally flawed and has been strongly criticised by experts in safety risk communications as ineffective and inefficient. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of security awareness techniques this paper leverages safety risk communications which is a mature discipline with common objectives. A critical feature of safety risk communications which is missing from the information security approach is a set of methodologies to systematically evaluate audience requirements. Accordingly, this paper explores the concepts of bounded rationality, mental models and the Extended Parallel Processing Model in an information security context.","Bounded Rationality; Extended Parallel Processing Model; Human Vulnerabilities; Information Security Awareness; Mental Models; NIST 800-50; Risk Communication; Safety; Satisfying","Accident prevention; Behavioral research; Mobile security; Safety engineering; Bounded rationality; Extended parallel processing models; Human Vulnerabilities; Information security awareness; Mental model; NIST 800-50; Risk communication; Satisfying; Security of data"

Key national industries are the critical infrastructure (CI) and include telecommunications, energy, healthcare, agriculture, and transportation. These CI industries are becoming more dependent on a critical cyber infrastructure (CCI) of computer information systems and networks, which are vital to the continuity of the economy. Organized attackers are increasing in number and power with more powerful computing resources that increasingly threaten CCI software systems. The motivations for attacks range from terrorism, fraud, identity theft, espionage, and political activism. Government and industry research have found that most cyber attacks exploited known vulnerabilities and common software programming errors. Software publisher vendors have been unable to agree or implement a secure coding standard for two main reasons. The on-technical consumer is ill informed to demand secure quality products. These current conditions perpetuate preventable risk. As a result, software vendors do not implement security unless specifically required by the customer, leaving many systems full of gaps. Since most of exploited vulnerabilities are preventable, the implementation of a minimum level of software quality is one of the key countermeasures for protecting the critical information infrastructure. Government and industry can improve the resilience of the CI in an increasingly interdependent network of information systems by protecting the CCI with stronger software assurance practices and policies and strengthening product liability laws and fines for non-compliance. In this paper we discuss the increasing software and market risks to CCI and address the strategies to protect the CCI through enhancing software assurance practices and policies.","Critical cyber infrastructure; Secure programming quality; Software assurance","Computer software selection and evaluation; Critical infrastructures; Information systems; Information use; Network security; Product liability; Terrorism; Computer Information Systems; Critical cybe infrastructure; Critical infrastructure industries; Cyberinfrastructure; Energy; Infrastructure protection; Integrated information system; Secure programming; Secure programming quality; Software assurance; Cybersecurity"

However, I contend that because the rational predictability of game theory will continue to drive decisions and seek out patterns in them, game theory may identify (and intelligently weight) nodes of a decision tree that are not immediately recognizable to or favored by human decision-makers. While we can't create a network that is maximally resistant to random faults and maximally resistant to targeted faults, we can take into account the particular weaknesses and likelihoods of attack so that the weaknesses overlap in resistant ways--ways that correspond to risk preferences and security priorities. Moreover, using game theory to make a security strategy that is a calculated derivative of mapped potential outcomes will help us to avoid human biases and to respond to threats proportionately/economically. Rather than a process of continual growth, cyber evolution, like biological evolution, seems more aptly characterized as punctuated equilibrium-periods of relative stasis followed by quick, drastic periods of breakthrough. Reaching Nash equilibrium is unlikely in the cyberwar context because under unstable conditions, evolutionarily stable strategies don't run a typical course. While there may be no set of moves that is a ""solution"" in cyberwar strategy, game theory allows human decisionmakers to intelligently identify and weight decision paths to transcend cognitive biases. This paper seeks to change the way of thinking about cyberwar--from one of stockpiling weapons, to one of looking for patterns--thinking about the problem of cyber insecurity more holistically. The paper challenges some of the myopia in thinking about cyber in existing ""warfare"" terms and proposes that organic models' tendency toward game theoretic equilibrium may help us conceive of the cyberwar decisionmaking landscape more effectively.","Cyberwarfare; Game theory; Layered defense; Nash equilibrium","Biology; Computation theory; Cybersecurity; Decision trees; Cyberwar; Cyberwarfare; Decision makers; Decision paths; Human decisions; Layered defense; Minimax; Nash equilibria; Random faults; Risk preference; Game theory"

Therefore, detecting whether digital video is tampered is very important for information security. Aiming at the copy-move tampering of homologous video sequences, this paper proposes a method to detect copy-move tampering of video sequences by measuring the correlation between image contents. Firstly, the video frame content is transformed into a series of continuous image frames, the image is divided into blocks, and the eight feature vectors of each frame are extracted. Then the correlation between frames is calculated by using the Euclidean distance, and the dynamic deviation threshold is constructed by adding the deviation matrix to detect the copy-move tampering sequence. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve ideal results for copy-move forgery detection of homologous video sequences.  © 2023 IEEE.","deviation matrix; frame sequential copy-move; video tampering","Computer graphics; Multimedia systems; Software reliability; Video recording; Video signal processing; Copy moves; Copy-move forgery detections; Deviation matrix; Digital multimedia; Digital videos; Frame sequential copy-move; matrix; Multimedia equipment; Video sequences; Video tampering; Security of data"

Baking Trojans have been notoriously difficult to kill and to date most antivirus and security technologies fail to detect or prevent them from causing havoc. Zeus which is considered as one of the most nefarious financial and banking Trojans targets business and financial institutions to perform unauthorized automated clearinghouse (ACH) and wire transfer transactions for check and payment processing. Zeus is causing billions of dollars in losses and is facilitating identity theft of innocent users for financial gains. Zeus Crimeware does one thing very well that every security researcher envy's-obfuscation. Zeus kit conceals the exploit code every time a binary is created. Zeus Crimeware has an inbuilt binary generator that generates a new binary file on every use that is radically different from others; which evades detection from antivirus or security technologies that rely on signature based detection. The effectiveness of an up to date antivirus against Zeus is thus not 100%, not 90%, not even 50%-it's just 23% which is alarming. No matter how smart and how different Zeus binaries are, most of them share a few common behavioral patterns such as an ability to take screenshots of a victim's machine, or control it remotely, hijacking E-banking sessions and logging them to the level of impersonation or add additional pages to a website and monitor them, or steal passwords that have been stored by popular programs and use them. In this paper we present detection algorithms that can help the antivirus community to ensure a variant of a known malware can still be detected without the need of creating a signature; a similarity analysis (based on specific quantitative measures) is performed to produce a matrix of similarity scores that can be utilized to determine the likelihood that a piece of code or binary under inspection contains a particular malware. The hypothesis is that all versions of the same malware family or similar malware family share a common core signature that is a combination of several features of the code (binary). Results from our recent experiments on 40 different variants of Zeus show very high similarity scores (over 85%). Interestingly Zeus variants have high similarity scores with other banking Trojans (Torpig, Bugat, and Clampi) and a well know data stealing Trojan Qakbot. We present experimental results that indicate that our proposed techniques can provide a better detection performance against banking Trojans like Zeus Crimeware.","Anatomy of zeus; Banking trojans; Bugat; Clampi; Malware analytics; Malware similarity analysis; Torpig; Zeus crimeware","Codes (symbols); Crime; Cybersecurity; Data obfuscation; Finance; Anatomy of zeus; Banking trojans; Bugat; Clampi; Crimeware; Malware analytic; Malware similarity analyse; Malwares; Similarity analysis; Torpig; Zeus crimeware; Malware"

Respondents were presented with a range of questions designed to measure their experience and knowledge of security. In addition, 2 scenarios were presented to respondents which examined their understanding of security warnings and potential threats, including email phishing and a potentially fraudulent attack through downloading an application. The survey results revealed that end-users are still experiencing significant difficulties with understanding and reacting to current state-of-the-art security applications, messages and potential threats. Furthermore, evidence suggests there is a corresponding need for a novel approach to improve perception and usability of information security.","Human Computer Interaction; Interface; Messages; Perceptions; Security; Usability; Warning","Human computer interaction; Interfaces (materials); Mobile security; Sensory perception; Surveys; Usability engineering; Messages; Potential threats; Security; Security application; Security features; Security warning; Usability; Warning; Security of data"

This questionnaire asked each of the 117 participants to evaluate 50 emails-half that were genuine and half that were phishing emails. In addition, demographic, personality and cognitive information was elicited from each participant. The major findings of this preliminary investigation indicate that personal characteristics such as familiarity with computers, extraversion, openness and cognitive impulsivity each have a significant effect on an email user's response to phishing emails.","Human behaviour; Information risk; Information security (InfoSec); Phishing; Social engineering","Computer crime; Electronic mail; Personal computers; Security of data; Social networking (online); Surveys; Cognitive information; Collaborative research projects; Human behaviours; Information risk; Personal characteristics; Phishing; Social engineering; Web-based questionnaires; Behavioral research"

Despite the development, promulgation, and implementation of information assurance best practices, inevitably an organization will experience an information incident (e.g., the loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, and/or authenticity of an information asset). When this occurs, it is imperative to inform those that are critically dependent on the affected information resources in a timely and relevant manner so that appropriate contingency measures can be taken to assure mission operations. While various methods have been proposed to improve the timeliness of incident notification, little work has been done to investigate how to improve the relevance of notification to affected decision makers. In this paper, we explore recent developments in improving the relevance of notification that use shared mission representations as a means to efficiently communicate potential mission impacts following an information incident. Specifically, we consider the use of shared representations of the organizational functions, tasks, and processes, annotated with information dependencies and constraints, as a means to communicate relevant mission impacts to decision makers in a timely manner. We conjecture that the use of annotated models provides the ability to provide meaningful, actionable understanding of the potential impact following an information incident.","Mission assurance; Mission impact assessment; Situational awareness","Knowledge management; Data informations; Decision makers; Embedded information; Impact assessments; Military organizations; Mission assurances; Mission impact assessment; Mission impacts; Potential missions; Situational awareness; Decision making"

However, there is no systematic method for defining the complex mapping between cyber assets (hardware, software, data), missions and users. This paper reports the results of an interdisciplinary workshop on how to map relationships between cyber assets and the users, missions, business processes and other entities that depend on those assets. The workshop yielded information about types of impact assessment beyond mission and financial analyses; scenarios illustrating the complex relationships between assets, mission and users; and models for expressing those relationships. The results will be used to develop a system that will automatically populate an ontology from commonly available network data and allow computer network defense, information technology and disaster recovery practitioners to query the system for information about the impact of the loss or degradation a cyber asset. Two workshops were held: the first focused primarily on mapping relationships between cyber assets, missions and users in commercial operations, and the second workshop focused on military operations. The participants included people whose operational responsibility is to assure the availability of cyber assets for critical missions, and technology providers and researchers in areas related to the mapping of cyber assets to missions. They represented the armed services, intelligence community, small and large businesses, county government, universities, research companies and large systems integrators. The workshop goals addressed in this paper are: 1) define the types of impacts one needs to assess when a cyber asset is attacked or fails; 2) analyze scenarios that illustrate impacts of a failed cyber asset on missions and users; and 3) model relationships between cyber assets, missions and users.","Business continuity; Cyber war; Information security; Mission assurance; Mission impact; Ontology","Complex networks; Cybersecurity; Mapping; Military operations; Network security; Search engines; Business continuity; Business operation; Complex mapping; Cyber war; Cyber-attacks; Hardware/software; Mission assurances; Mission impacts; Ontology's; Systematic method; Ontology"

While attackers act more andmore globally and coordinated, network defense is limited to examine local information only due to privacy concerns. To overcome this privacy barrier, we use secure multiparty computation (MPC) for the problem of aggregating network data from multiple domains. We first optimize MPC comparison operations for processing high volume data in near real-time by not enforcing protocols to run in a constant number of synchronization rounds. We then implement a complete set of basic MPC primitives in the SEPIA library. For parallel invocations, SEPIA's basic operations are between 35 and several hundred times faster than those of comparable MPC frameworks. Using these operations, we develop four protocols tailored for distributed network monitoring and security applications: the entropy, distinct count, event correlation, and top-k protocols. Extensive evaluation shows that the protocols are suitable for near real-time data aggregation. For example, our top-k protocol PPTKS accurately aggregates counts for 180,000 distributed IP addresses in only a few minutes. Finally, we use SEPIA with real traffic data from 17 customers of a backbone network to collaboratively detect, analyze, and mitigate distributed anomalies. Our work follows a path starting from theory, going to system design, performance evaluation, and ending with measurement. Along this way, it makes a first effort to bridge two very disparate worlds: MPC theory and network monitoring and security practices. © 2011, ACM.

The result is that many countries are not properly prepared, nor adequately protected by legislation, in the event of a cyber attack on a national level.

In this paper, we suggestsa socio-technical model that was previously used to model USA's national computer security policy as a model that can be applied to the information security metrics area. The model can provide a unifying, holistic view on the area, illustrating interrelationships and gaps between various efforts at different abstraction levels. The proposed model can be mapped to some of the existing paradigms and, possibly, help address some of their individual limitations by offering a more unified perspective.","Information Security; Security Management; Security Measurement; Security Metrics; Security Models","Cybernetics; Security systems; Abstraction level; Dynamic aspects; Information-security measurement; Security management; Security measurement; Security metrics; Security model; Sociotechnical; Security of data"

Recently, researchers have started exploring the applicability of game theory to address the cyber security problem. The interaction between the attacks and the defense mechanisms can be considered as a game played between the attacker and the defender (system administrator). One of the techniques that has been proposed in the literature used stochastic game models to emulate network security games and showed how to determine the best strategy for the defender considering the possible attack strategy used by the attacker. However, the prior research assumes that the players have perfect information about the current state of the game, which generally does not hold in reality. Our model relaxes this assumption and enriches the prior game models by enabling them to capture more realistic scenarios. In particular, this paper presents a theoretical analysis by which the defender can compute his/her best strategy to reach the Nash equilibrium of a stochastic game assuming imperfect sensory information. In addition, this paper shows that if the defender follows the strategy prescribed by the perfect information model, the Nash equilibrium is not achieved and the attacker's payoff can be higher. Our theoretical analysis is tested in simulation experiments and the results validate our approach.","Game theory; Imperfect information; Nash equilibrium; Network security; Simulation; Stochastic games","Computation theory; Cybersecurity; Network security; Sensory analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Cyber security; Cyberspaces; Game models; Imperfect information; Nash equilibria; Networks security; Perfect informations; Security problems; Simulation; Stochastic game; Game theory"

In remote access systems, speaker utterances are recoded and communicated through a communication channel to a receiver that performs the identification process. Speaker identification is based on characterizing each speaker with a set of features extracted from his or her utterance. Extracting the features from a clean speech signal guarantees the high success rate in the identification process. In real cases, a clean speech is not available for feature extraction due to channel degradations, background noise, or interfering audio signals. As a result, there is a need for speech enhancement, deconvolution, and separation algorithms to solve the problem of speaker identification in the presence of impairments. Another important issue, which deserves consideration, is how to enhance the security of a speaker identification system. This can be accomplished by watermark embedding in the clean speech signals at the transmitter. If this watermark is extracted correctly at the receiver, it can be used to ensure the correct speaker identification. Another means of security enhancement is the encryption of speech at the transmitter. Speech encryption prevents eavesdroppers from getting the speech signals that will be used for feature extraction to avoid any unauthorized access to the system by synthesis trials. Multilevels of security can be achieved by implementing both watermarking and encryption at the transmitter. The watermarking and encryption algorithms need to be robust to speech enhancement, and deconvolution algorithms to achieve the required degree of security and the highest possible speaker identification rates. This book provides for the first time a comprehensive literature review on how to improve the performance of speaker identification systems in noisy environments, by combining different feature extraction techniques with speech enhancement, deconvolution, separation, watermarking, and/or encryption. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2011.","Chaotic baker map; Signal separation; Singular value decomposition; Speech deconvolution; Speech encryption; Speech enhancement; Speech watermarking; Wavelet denoising; Wiener filter","Audio acoustics; Audio watermarking; Cryptography; Deconvolution; Extraction; Feature extraction; Loudspeakers; Reviews; Security of data; Speech communication; Speech enhancement; Transmitters; Deconvolution algorithm; Encryption algorithms; Feature extraction techniques; Identification process; Security enhancements; Separation algorithms; Speaker identification; Speaker identification systems; Speech recognition"

The networked world has nourished an environment in which cyber warfare can flourish. Cyber warfare has become a desired mode of fighting when attacking a highly industrialized and wired nation. Nations throughout the world are developing and executing cyber warfare strategies to disrupt their enemy's communications, logistics, transportation and militaryinfrastructures. One of the most powerful attacks that can be rendered on a nation's ability to make war is a cyber attack on the computerized systems that control its critical infrastructure. Critical infrastructure includes a nation's communications, public works, financial and utility institutions. In the United States, the utility infrastructure control systems were designed as non-networked, stand alone entities to prevent unauthorized infiltration. With the privatization of utility services, these systems are now being integrated with corporate communication infrastructures in an effort to achieve cost savings and are now vulnerable to attack. The systems, with their dedicated software and hardware, are unable to be patched to address security concerns. Additionally, when utility services upgrade their control systems, budgetary constraints force them to select a commercially available software packages that are available throughout the world. These programs can also be purchased by the enemies of the state and then manipulated to gain knowledge of the system that can result in unfettered access to the nations critical infrastructure control systems. Although public and private organizations throughout the nation have taken the initiative and made small strives in security, more must be done. The government of the United States must develop and enforce standards on infrastructure control systems to safeguard the nation's lifeblood, its critical infrastructure. This paper provides a non-technical overview of the United States' critical utility infrastructure control systems. The overview includes the proliferation of their use, their history, security threats and incidents. Also highlighted are some of the initiatives that both public and private organizations have taken to address this issue. Finally recommendations to increase security are made.","Cyber warfare; Infrastructure control systems","Budget control; Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Network security; Networked control systems; Privatization; Public works; Security systems; Computer technology; Cyber warfare; Economic advantages; Infrastructure control system; Private organizations; Public organizations; Security weakness; System vulnerability; Utility infrastructure; Warfare strategies; Critical infrastructures"

Because of the reported cyber intrusions into America’s electric power grid and other utilities, there is the possibility that sensors could also be positioned in key privately-owned infrastructure assets and the associated cyberspace. Sensors provide situational awareness of adversary operations, but acting directly on the collected information can reveal key sensor attributes such as modality, location, range, sensitivity and credibility. The challenge is to preserve the secrecy of sensors and their attributes while providing defenders with the freedom to respond to the adversary’s operations. This paper presents a framework for using deception to shield cyberspace sensors. The purpose of deception is to degrade the accuracy of the adversary’s beliefs regarding the sensors, give the adversary a false sense of completeness, and/or cause the adversary to question the available information. The paper describes several sensor shielding tactics, plays and enabling methods, along with the potential pitfalls.

However, trust is a fuzzy concept that needs further examination and attention from multiple levels. For example, security is very important from a user's point of view in trusting that technology will function in accordance with the user's intended and requested function. This paper reviews the concept of patient safety, which thus far has been discussed and defined from a narrow technical perspective. We demonstrate that it is much more complex, and that it is not primarily the technical issues that are problematic, but rather the cultural, process-related and personnel issues. Our results point to a need for a new approach, which takes the patients' view of healthcare and the patient-related digital information as its focus. The discussion is made from a Swedish perspective, but the issues are international. The needs for information and knowledge in healthcare are obvious. Without clear definitions of concepts and roles, a good information flow or process cannot be designed. Our discussion shows that trusted digital patient information gives an opportunity for a patient-focused healthcare. Multidimensional trust must be addressed on all levels; organization, person and technology. More empirical research into trust in digital patient-related information is necessary, to develop a model for patient safety from a trust perspective that encompasses all levels of trust.","Electronic healthcare records; Information security; Patient safety; Trust","Health care; Mobile security; Communication and collaborations; Digital information; Digitized patients; Electronic healthcare records; Multi-dimensional trust; Patient information; Patient safety; Trust; Security of data"

Externally, an interdependent world linked by the Internet means that issues or problems that arise in any part of the globe can impact this country, from pandemics to drug trafficking to cybersecurity. What happens in countries little known to most citizens during the pre-9/11 era, such as Afghanistan or Yemen, can affect the United States in consequential ways. Consider that this nation seems engaged in an endless global war (dubbed the “long war” by some analysts) against terrorists and their network of supporters, a marked departure from the pre-9/11 era of conflicts between and among nations. Today’s wars appear “limited in scope yet virtually unlimited in duration,” where Americans are not asked to sacrifice (except for those in the military and their families) but “to go on with their routines, not change them” (Hampson 2011, 2A). Addressing these challenges and developments can provoke sharp disagreement among our national lawmakers. On March 10, 2010, for example, the House by a 356 to 65 vote overwhelmingly rejected a non-binding resolution (H. Con. Res. 248), offered by Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan within 30 days. Representative Kucinich’s basic point was that the cost of the ten-year (and counting) war in financial and other resources, in military casualties, and to nation-building at home is not worth the price. “Our supposed nation-building in Afghanistan has come at the destruction of our own,” he argued. The military surge announced by President Barack Obama in December 2009 “cements the path of the United States down the road of previous occupiers that earned Afghanistan its nickname as the ‘graveyard of empires’” (Congressional Record March 10, 2010, H1251). In response, then House Armed Services Chairman Ike Skeleton (D-MO) exclaimed: “Have we forgotten? Have we forgotten what happened to America on 9/11? Have we forgotten who did it? Have we forgotten those who protected and gave [al Qaeda] a safe haven?” (Ibid., H1255) (Skeleton was defeated for reelection in November 2010 when the GOP reclaimed control of the House.) © Cambridge University Press 2012.","",""

This trust relation is central to building services in distributed environments, and is closely related to information security. Almost every standard on information security is concerned with the internal control of an organization, and particularly with authentication. In this paper, we focus on a trust model of certificate authentication. Conventionally, a trust model of certificates is defined as a validation of chains of certificates. However, today, this trust model does not function well because of the fragmentation problem caused by complexities of paths and by fine a requirement at security levels. In this paper, we propose “dynamic path validation” together with another trust model of PKI for controlling this situation. First, we propose Policy Authority. Policy Authority assigns a level of compliance (LoC) to CAs in its trust domain. LoC is evaluated in terms of the certificate common criteria of Policy Authority. Moreover, it controls the path building with considerations of LoC. Therefore, we can flexibly evaluate levels of CP/CPS’s in a single server. In a typical bridge model, we need as many bridge CAs as the number of required levels of CP/CPS’s. In our framework, instead, we can do the same task in a single server, by which we can save costs of maintaining lists of trust anchors at multiple levels. © 2011 Information Processing Society of Japan.","",""

This paper is not only an update to the original research, to review the original hypothesis and determine if the predictions from four years ago were correct, but it also mines new data sources to take a fresh look at current contracts. In this research, the authors analyze the growing new opportunities in cyber warfare, strategic communications, psychological operations and cyber security. The scope of IO/IA is also expanding farther into areas of diplomacy, economics, and homeland security, while growing even more central to complex unconventional and conventional warfare applications. In addition, organizational change is accompanying these doctrinal and application area changes, which has led to a subsequent revision of the contract opportunities available. Likewise, new revisions of policy and documentation are also expected to arrive in the foreseeable future, which could lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of cultural values and psychological roles among the multiple political players. In this review, we explore what new and promising opportunities for collaboration exist for academics, and we hope that this paper can alert researchers to alternate opportunities for funding in the IO and IA arena that they may not have considered previously.","Contracts; Department of defense; Information assurance; Information operations; Proposals","Contracts; Cybersecurity; National security; 'current; Department of Defence; Fundings; Growth opportunities; Information assurance; Information information; Information operations; Information warfare; Operations contract; Proposal; Network security"

From a pedagogical perspective, understanding the Internet has become as essential as learning a language or learning to write. In our technology driven economy we must understand both its power and its limitations. Presently, cyberlaw scholarship is in its early stages particularly as it relates to surveillance issues and international legal frameworks for the prevention of cyber crime. Young students have much to contribute to this growing discipline and cyberlaw scholarship can contribute to the challenges faced by our Executive and Legislative Branches as they address important issues of national security and the growing incidence of cybercrime around the globe. Though many law schools offer courses on cyberlaw or ecommerce, there is an absence of these courses offered through the schools of management, computer science and engineering schools beyond a very basic level. Even scholars in the field have noted the importance of the subject matter, but there is a general lack of discussion among faculty as to how the course should be designed and delivered. Largely, these courses have focused on intellectual property rights and rights to privacy and have failed to cover the important topics of legal frameworks for surveillance, crime prevention, and the harmonization of laws among different cultures, jurisdictions and countries. The purpose of this paper is to develop a cyberlaw curriculum that will address the present void in this critical area of the law. The recommended curriculum will incorporate the current legal framework for regulating cyber crimes and contrast it with national cyberlaw systems around the globe. The curriculum will introduce basic theory, analytical dialogue, creative concepts, and relevant case studies that will persuade students to appreciate and apply cybersecurity concepts in their professional career. Using an empirical approach, our research will investigate, assess and evaluate legal frameworks for cybersecurity. The curriculum will be of value to students, professionals and academicians interested in (1) advancing their knowledge of the necessity for international law on cybercrime and warfare, (2) understanding legal authorities, jurisdiction and boundaries in engaging adversarial cyber activities, and (3) developing legal frameworks to provide cybersecurity for critical infrastructure.","Cyberlaw; Cybersecurity; Internet; Surveillance","Computer crime; Crime; Cybersecurity; Employment; Engineering education; Intellectual property; Monitoring; National security; Students; Teaching; Computer professionals; Cyber security; Cyber-crimes; Cyberlaw; Engineering professionals; Law schools; Legal frameworks; Legislative branches; Power; Surveillance; Curricula"

Whilst many initiatives, programs and strategies have been proposed to improve the level of information security awareness, most have been directed at organizations. Given people's use of technology is primarily focused between the workplace and home; this paper seeks to understand the knowledge and practice relationship between these environments. Through a developed survey, it was identifed that the majority of the learning about information security occurred in the workplace, where clear motivations, such as legislation and regulation, existed. Results found that users were more than willing to engage with such awareness raising initiatives. From a comparison of practice between work and home environments, it was found that this knowledge and practice obtained at the workplace was transferred to the home environment. Given this positive transferability of knowledge and the willingness to learn about how to remain secure, an opportunity exists to move away from specifc organizational awareness programs and to move towards awareness raising strategies that will develop an all-round individual security culture for users independent of the environment they are operating in.

The challenge is to design and evolve multi-disciplinary curricula that provide theoretical as well as hands-on experience and are also available to a broad student audience is of strategic importance for the future of reliable and secure systems. We present our experience in designing and evolving information security programs that have grown to over 650 students per year since their inception eight years ago and have graduated more than 250 students. We discuss three major directions in the evolution of the program: the increased focus of the core and growth of concentration electives, the design of cyber law curriculum and coordination with the business continuity programs, and the introduction of new educational technologies such as virtualization and video-collaboration and flexible online and blended delivery formats. The rapid growth of the program, the changes in the discipline and the great diversity of professional interests of our students required broadening of the curriculum with courses and modules on emerging technologies such as digital forensics, biometrics, security policies and procedures, privacy and security in health care, cyber law, as well as the coordination of the curriculum with existing programs in business continuity. Special efforts were expended to the introduction of more participatory pedagogy, more specifically by developing a series of virtual laboratories that brought real world situations into the class room and through video-collaboration tools that encourage team building. The accessibility of the programs was increased through the introduction of flexible delivery formats. After establishing the programs in the traditional classroom, we added an blended and online version that rapidly found a national audience.","Business continuity; Cyber law; Digital forensics; Information security education; Online and blended learning; Virtualization","Digital forensics; E-learning; Electronic crime countermeasures; Security of data; Security systems; Students; Teaching; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Blended learning; Business continuity; Cybe law; Flexible delivery; Information security education; Information security professionals; Online learning; Security curriculum; Video collaborations; Virtualizations; Curricula"

The proposed National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (NDAA FY2010) and the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (IIA FY2010) both contain provisions that would affect programs and funding for current and future cybersecurity-related programs. In May 2009, the Obama Administration issued its 60-day review of cybersecurity policy, declaring that U.S. information networks would be treated as a strategic national asset. There is no single congressional committee or executive agency with primary responsibility over all aspects of cybersecurity; each entity involved pursues cybersecurity from a limited vantage point dictated by committee jurisdiction. Many different initiatives exist, but because of fragmentation of missions and responsibilities, ""stove-piping,"" and a lack of mutual awareness between stakeholders, it is difficult to ascertain where there may be programmatic overlap or gaps in cybersecurity policy. Drawing from common themes found in the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Commission for the 44th Presidency, and the proposed near-term action plan from the President's recent Cyberspace Policy Review, this report identifies priority areas in cybersecurity for policy consideration. The report then lists and synopsizes current legislation that has been developed to address various aspects of the cybersecurity problem. It then lists the current status of the legislation and compares legislation with existing executive branch initiatives. Finally, analysis of information contained in executive branch initiatives and congressional legislation is used to offer cybersecurity-related considerations for Congress. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Governments have spent billions to monitor cyberspace and have entered agreements with corporations to provide surveillance data on adversarial groups, competitors, and citizenry (Reuters, 2010). The Chinese government's monitoring of the Internet (Markoff, 2008), the United Kingdom's plan to track every email, phone call, and website visited (Whitehead, 2010), and the recent announcement from the United States that a program named the ""Perfect Citizen"" (Bradley, 2010) will be used to identify those committing cybercrimes and terrorist activities. These government surveillance programs have many concerned that anonymity on the Internet is non-existent and that real objectivity and candidness found on news, educational, and research websites is being replaced with a ""big brother"" atmosphere; preventing open discussion and information transfers between domains. Although the initial intent of network and Internet monitoring may be honourable; terrorists, hackers, and cyber-criminals already have access to the necessary tools and methodologies to continue in their activities unabated. State and non-state adversaries can use these same tools and methodologies to divert malicious and offensive actions towards a common adversary, avoiding attribution while increasing tensions among non-actors. Concerned educators, scientists, and citizens are rebelling against Internet monitoring providing the impetus for developers and entrepreneurs to create methods, tools, and virtual private networks that provide secrecy for those wishing to remain invisible; avoiding detection from employers, law enforcement, and other government agencies (Ultimate-Anonymity, 2010). The intent of this research is to first briefly identify the efforts required by governments to track and monitor individuals and groups wishing to remain anonymous within the cyber community. The authors define ""cyber community"" as the boundaries within any tool, process, or mechanism utilizing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP), or similar protocols that allow for the transfer and aggregation of information and data. In contrast, the authors will then identify a process to remain wholly anonymous in the context of an internet identity. This will be demonstrated in a step-by-step case study using a ""paranoid"" approach to remaining anonymous.","Anonymity; Big brother; Foreign proxy; Hacker; Internet surveillance; Network","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Monitoring; Personal computing; Security systems; Terrorism; Transmission control protocol; Websites; Anonymity; Big brother; Cyber communities; Foreign proxy; Hacker; In networks; Internet monitoring; Internet surveillances; Network; Networks security; Network security"

We define a novel security policy language that can express what information a program may release, under what conditions (or, when) such release may occur, and which procedures are involved with the release (or, where in the code the release occur). We describe a dataflow analysis for precisely inferring these policies, and build a tool that instantiates this analysis for the Java programming language.

This evolution has led to a continuous remodeling of companies 'systems to enable them to adapt to the new needs. These changes increase these systems' complexity, making them more vulnerable. Computer attacks against organizations are therefore increasing considerably. If this is to be avoided, information security engineers need reliable and validated solutions with which to confront security problems, along with agile solutions to confront the new technological necessities in an optimal manner. Security patterns are good mechanisms with which to perform this task since they provide documented, validated and tested solutions to recurring problems.

Single Sign-On (SSO) projects are a special case of Identity and Access Management (IAM) projects. They are usually undertaken with the aim of increasing the user friendliness of Corporate IT systems' user log-on processes. This should result in abolishing the use of multiple username and password combinations the user has to remember and change at different intervals. The SSO aim should be achieved without jeopardizing information security in any way. Increasing user convenience in such a manner will increase user satisfaction with the IT department along with general productivity levels. Cost control related to IT help desks resetting forgotten passwords should follow. SSO can also help organizations address information security compliance requirements, through the central logging (and audit facilities) of all access attempts and authorization decisions granted in relation to the organization's restricted information resources. Sometimes compliance objectives are in fact the major business driver for SSO. In the consumer space customer loyalty and retention rates are often cited as an important commercial driver for SSO projects. With the advent of the de-perimeterized organization1 and increased scepticism around 'Cloud Security' is SSO still a viable worthwhile goal for organisations?

However, the use of this technology in support of military operations is constantly subject to adversarial threats. Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Other (CIAO) breaches of information can adversely affect the outcome of military operations. In order to enable the quantification of the effect of these breaches, we model military operations using Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). Operations are represented as process models as a set of interconnected activities. Each of the activities of a mission is analyzed to identify dependencies on the underlying information technology (IT) resources. IT resources are in turn protected by protector resources. The dependencies are represented using two dependency matrices. One matrix represents the dependency of military activities on information resources. The other matrix represents the dependency of information resources on their protecting resources. Based on one of the author's actual combat experience, we present a hypothetical, but realistic, military operation. For this operation we develop the following: 1) a BPMN representation of the operation from the Receipt of Operations Order (military term for the start of the mission) to the Change of Mission (military term for the end of the operation), 2) the list of information resources that are needed to support the activities of the operation, 3) the list of the protectors for these information resources, 4) the dependency matrix between the components of the activities of the BPMN and the information resources, and 5) the dependency matrix between the information resources and their protectors. We will discuss the impact of CIAO breaches by tracing the chain of affects on the information resources, the activities, and eventually the outcome of the operation itself.","BPMN; Information security management; Mission modeling; Security models","Information management; Information systems; Information use; Security of data; Systems engineering; Business process modeling; Business process modeling notation; Dependency matrix; Information resource; Information security managements; matrix; Mission models; Modeling notation; Security modeling; Technology resources; Military operations"

These customized 'cyber weapons' are undetectable to antivirus signature-based scanners and difficult to detect with heuristic-based scanners. Governments and many organizations simply cannot wait for commercial malware detection solutions, because researchers likely will never receive a targeted malware artifact-it may be the only instance in existence-unless the customer first finds it themselves and submits it for review. Unbeknownst to many antivirus customers, who mistakenly think they are watching the malware game from the safety and security of the sidelines, wily cyber criminals have quietly begun targeting them as the weakest players on the field. While several critical malware problems remain the focus of intense research, this research paper investigates methods of automatically identifying disparities between malware types using machine learning techniques. The results from these experiments can help all interested entities to better identify and classify specific artifacts that they discover possibly even enabling more expedient recovery procedures. Other applications of these methods include automatically classifying malware types for large malware repositories or assisting antivirus researcher agreement on a specific universal malware type standard. Fostering agreement in the antivirus research community on a universal type standard benefits both the research community and antivirus customers, because standards allow for effective and appropriate response and recovery procedures. These standards also allow academic research efforts to effectively leverage the expertise of the antivirus researcher community. Preliminary results on relatively small datasets demonstrate reasonable confidence in classification accuracy for three different malware types based on partial and full agreement between three major antivirus company products. This methodology serves as a quick look classification for identification and prioritization of work for appropriate information technology personnel. Increasing the number of samples, applying a variety of machine learning techniques, and incorporating other software types to this research will increase the significance of these results and help to define the essence of various software classes.","Classification; Machine learning; Malware; Network defense","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer system recovery; Crime; Cybersecurity; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Recovery; Sales; Scanning; Anti virus; Cyber-crimes; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Malware attacks; Malwares; Network defense; Recovery procedure; Research communities; Type classifications; Malware"

We believe that improved knowledge of the mission impact of a cyber attack will lead to improved, more targeted responses, creating more attack resistant systems that can operate through cyber attacks.

Phishing attackers try to steal the confidential information of the users such as their username, password etc. Phishing is done either by e-mails or instant messaging or by a spoofed website which is an exact replica of original one. It is very difficult to distinguish fake websites and legitimate websites. Homograph attacks help in phishing and make it more difficult for users to identify them. Some malware like key-loggers also help to steal the crucial information. A different type of malware called transaction generator (TG) is also used by attackers. Instead of passing the confidential information to attackers, a TG waits until users login into their accounts and then does the transaction illegally in the background. In this paper, we present several anti-phishing methods with their pros and cons. In addition, we propose an intelligent anti-phishing solution named Password-Transaction Secure Window (PTSW) in order to secure users and their personal information.

Among them, the dual random phase encoding method has received much attention since it was proposed by Réfrégier and Javidi in the middle 1990s. Since then, a number of works in the field were proposed introducing different variations of this technique. On the other hand, the space-time duality refers to the close mathematical analogy that exists between the equations describing the paraxial diffraction of beams in space and the first-order temporal dispersion of optical pulses in dielectric media. It is generally used for extending to the temporal domain well-known properties of spatial optical configurations. In this work a new approach is developed for the secure data transmission problem in fiber optic links. We propose the encoding of time-varying optical signals, mainly for short-haul applications, with encryption methods that can be considered the time domain counterparts of the dual random phase encoding process and two of its more frequent variations: the fractional Fourier transform dual random phase encoding and the Fresnel transform dual random phase encoding. Further, as performance is a very relevant subject in fiber optic links, we will analyze mechanisms to produce time limited, as well as bandwidth limited, encoded signals. To this end, the different signal broadenings produced by each stage of the encoding process, in both time and frequency domains, are analyzed by using the Wigner distribution function formalism, and general expressions for the time width, as well as the bandwidth, in every encryption stage is obtained. The numerical simulations show good system performances, and a comparison between the different encryption processes is made. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed methods is analyzed against the variation of typical parameters of the encryption-decryption setup. Finally, the implementation of this proposal with current photonic technology is discussed. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a program that analyzes what happens or has happened during an execution and finds indications that the computer has been misused. In this paper, we have proposed an effective IDS in which a local agent present in every node collects data from its own system and classifies anomaly behaviors using SVM classifier. The local agent uses the mobile agent to gather information from the neighboring node to check its integrity before it allows the system to send data to its neighboring node.

To facilitate such research, we define two formal methods that can be executed by computational agents in a multi-agent system. First, we formalize the definition of capabilities and business models as a 'viable system'. We generalize it to encompass technological, sociological, and economic aspects of a system, which together comprise its capabilities. Second, we formalize the method of pattern language. This allows agents to generate and reason about alternative solutions. This expands the space of possibilities, and thus simulates a form of inventiveness.

Because of the increasing in importance and quantity of natural language texts, linguistic steganography plays a more and more important role in Information Security (IS) area today. Substitution-based linguistic steganography is one of the most commonly used linguistic steganography methods, which is of considerable security and favorable simpleness. In this paper, we propose a straightforward method based on Relative Frequency Analysis (RFA), which makes use of the frequency characteristics of the testing texts (the texts being tested), to detect substitution-based linguistic steganography. We formally prove several properties about relative frequency which can be used in the detection process and propose a detection scheme. And then as an example, an existent synonym-substitution system T-Lex is examined and the detection experiment is carried out. In the experiment with pure literature texts, the accuracy, precision and recall of the detection are found to be as high as 98.64%, 97.77% and 99.55%, respectively, when the substitution count is 90, while in the experiment with balanced texts, the highest detection accuracy is 95%, which indicates that the detection scheme is promising. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Both strategy documents will contribute to a growing policy consensus regarding cyber security and defence as well as provide better policy insights regarding cyber offence. In doing so, they will contribute to a better understanding of how NATO and the U.S. want to prepare for, and conduct cyber warfare in a manner congruent with the law of armed conflict. In addition, they will determine to what extent this branch of the law needs to be better understood, developed, or reformed. Accordingly, this paper indicates how the existing legal and policy frameworks intersect with practical aspects of cyber warfare and associated intelligence activities, analyses how the new strategy documents develop and change the existing policy framework, and what repercussions this may have for the interpretation and application of the law of armed conflict. It also demonstrates how the new strategy documents inform the policy and legal discourse and hence help confirm that NATO and U.S. as well as other NATO Nations' cyber activities are, and will continue to be, lawful and legitimate.","Collective defence; collective security; Law of Armed Conflict; NATO Strategic Concept 2010; U.S. Cyberstrategy 3.0","Computer crime; Armed conflict; Collective defense; Collective security; Cyber warfare; Law of armed conflict; NATO strategic concept 2010; Operational laws; Policy framework; Strategic concepts; US cyberstrategy 3.0; Cybersecurity"

Such inevitable revolution brings about a lot of benefits but also several legal concerns. It has emerged from a recent study that security privacy and legal matters represent the main obstacles that are encountered when implementing cloud computing, because the market provides only marginal assurance. This paper briefly describes the main legal issues related to cloud computing and then focuses on data protection and data security, which are by far the biggest concerns for both cloud service providers (CSPs) and (potential) customers. I build on the work done last year as contributor to the European Networks and Information Security Agency (ENISA) 'Cloud Computing Risk Assessment' to further analyse data protection and data security issues.

Still, many intensive applications perform poorly on smartphones due to the shortage of resources for computation, data storage, network bandwidth, and battery capacity. While such applications can be re-designed with client-server models to benefit from subscribed cloud services, the users are no longer in full control of the entire application execution, which has raised a serious concern. Meanwhile, privacy and security are also important issues, and it is an ongoing debate if public cloud services could be trusted with sensitive data. For mobile users to take full advantage of cloud services, these issues need to be resolved. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework for mobile users to execute existing Android applications on a personal virtual phone safely in the cloud. Instead of using a client-server model, the entire virtual phone is mostly controlled by the user to minimize the intervention from the service provider. Virtualization and encryption are employed to protect against eavesdropping from cloud providers and network attackers. To quickly migrate an Android application between the physical phone and the virtual phone, we use a new application-level checkpointing mechanism and minimize the state of the application.","Cloud applications; Information privacy; Information security; Operating system; Pervasive computing; Smartphone; Virtualization","Android (operating system); Cryptography; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Security of data; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Ubiquitous computing; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Web services; Android applications; Application execution; Cloud applications; Information privacy; Operating system; Pervasive applications; Privacy and security; Smart-phone applications; Mobile security"

In order to clarify this situation, we offer the following definition: cyberspace is a time-dependent set of interconnected information systems and the human users that interact with these systems. We describe the background of the definition and show why this approach may be preferable over others. Specifically, we revisit the terms coined by Norbert Wiener (the father of cybernetics) and William Gibson. We show that timedependence is an overlooked aspect of cyber space and make a case for including it in our proposed definition. In addition, we look at the implications that can be drawn from the time-dependence of cyberspace, especially in regard to cyber conflicts, which we define as a confrontation between two or more parties, where at least one party uses cyber attacks against the other(s). Specifically we review the implications on the potential for rapid deployments of offensive and defensive actions in cyberspace, the feasibility of mapping cyberspace, and the need for constant patrolling and reconnaissance.","Cyber attacks; Cyber conflicts; Cyberspace; Definition; Time","Computers; Cybersecurity; Network security; Terrorism; Cybe conflict; Cyber warfare; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-terrorism; Cyberspaces; Definition; On state; Security fields; Time; Time dependence; Computer crime"

It is particularly desirable to identify the attack methodology (e.g. differential power analysis using correlation or distance-of-means as the distinguisher) able to produce the best results. Such attempts are complicated by the many and varied factors contributing to attack success: the device power consumption characteristics, an attacker's power model, the distinguisher by which measurements and model predictions are compared, the quality of the estimations, and so on. Previous work has delivered partial answers for certain restricted scenarios. In this paper we assess the effectiveness of mutual information-based differential power analysis within a generic and comprehensive evaluation framework. Complementary to existing work, we present several notions/characterisations of attack success with direct implications for the amount of data required. We are thus able to identify scenarios in which mutual information offers performance advantages over other distinguishers. Furthermore we observe an interesting feature-unique to the mutual information based distinguisher-resembling a type of stochastic resonance, which could potentially enhance the effectiveness of such attacks over other methods in certain noisy scenarios. © 2011 International Association for Cryptologic Research.","mutual information; side channel analysis","Magnetic resonance; Security of data; Stochastic systems; Comprehensive evaluation; Cryptographic implementation; Differential power Analysis; Evaluation framework; Measurements and modeling; Mutual informations; Side-channel analysis; Stochastic resonances; Side channel attack"

This paper highlights why this may be the case. Research into the security of medical information has shown that many primary healthcare providers are unable to create an environment with effective information security. Numerous factors contribute to this complex situation including a trustful environment, the resultant security culture and the capability of individual healthcare organisations. Further, the growing importance of new directions in the use of patient information is considered. This paper discusses these issues and positions them within the complex environment that is healthcare. In our current health system infrastructure, the points of origin of patient information are our most vulnerable.

This pilot study is part of a larger research effort focused on exploring this topic. This is an interesting problem to study because security managers must make decisions based on instinct and experience rather than empirical security performance data. Yet some of the security managers are doing a decent job despite the lack of any empirical data. They face daily decisions on a variety of issues dealing with maintaining and improving the security integrity of their enterprises. While this is a constant problem confronting these managers, many are very successful. These effective managers, recognized by reputation, community and anecdotally, have ways of measuring effectiveness. However, these measures are more art and the data is only in the heads of the managers. Exploratory research was conducted to validate a method to explore how security managers make decisions about the allocation of security resources for their enterprise information security architectures. This paper presents the initial findings from the pilot study. The subjects of this pilot study were the Chief Technology and Chief Security Officers (CTO and CSO) of a large enterprise. The research method used was open-ended interviews followed by transcript analysis and categorization. The interview transcripts were analyzed to identify important themes and processes resulting in twenty-three categories of decision influences. While all categories are defined, five were common to the CTO and CSO and are highlighted. A key finding is that while the CTO and CSO share some concerns, they also have unique perspectives. This will be explored in future research from the perspective of effective team building for enterprise security management. The results of this pilot study will be used to compose a larger research effort to explore and document decision processes for successful security managers.","Decision-making; Information security management; Open-interview","Decision making; Human resource management; Industrial management; Security of data; Security systems; Decision-based; Decisions makings; Information security managements; Open-interview; Performance data; Pilot studies; Research efforts; Security manager; Security officers; Security performance; Managers"

Access control is concerned with controlling the access permissions of a user to an object. The rigorous use of IT enabling technology and the implementation of large ERP systems have increased the importance of access control and especially this of role-based access control (RBAC). The success of a policy based on RBAC depends on the implementation of the role model which calls for both business engineering and information technology skills. This paper proposes a bottom-up and top-down combined approach for system roles implementation. The approach is integrated to ARIS modelling methods supporting the creation of the role system and facilitating its maintenance and future improvement.

Another advantage is that the SA is not able to forge a public key without knowing the user's secret key.

Firsdy, products and services have become increasingly commoditised, thus leading to successive waves of outsourcing and offshoring. Secondly, the introduction of intelligent end-point devices and direct accessibility of web-based services has blurred the boundaries of traditional companies and their perimeter. As a result, the ""cloud computing"" paradigm creates new challenges for security management, including the business value and cost-benefit considerations. Traditional security models often fail to address this new universe, inasmuch as they are based upon the axiomatic idea of a ""closed"" corporate IT environment. Practical difficulties in outsourcing or third-party situations are therefore, at best, treated as a business issue that is addressed at the contractual or legal level. In many instances, this causes legal and technical problems, as service level agreements and contracts are flawed instruments for describing a fully de-perimeterised IT environment and its practical requirements. This in turn increases the risk of systemic failures, operational damage, and legal ramifications. The ISACA Business Model for Information Security (BMIS) provides a systemic foundation for managing cloud-based products and services in terms of their security aspects. The paper shows how the general model is applied and how the use of BMIS enhances the overall security level. It is further shown how aspects of governance, risk and compliance (GRC) may be included in order to align operational information security management with business requirements. The paper addresses practical steps towards securing a heavily clouded environment using recognised frameworks such as COBIT or the ISO 27000 series. Recommendations are given to enable direct use of the BMIS in day-to-day security management. © Vieweg+Teubner Verlag | Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH 2011.","","Cost benefit analysis; Electronics industry; Industrial management; Security of data; Business requirement; Information security managements; Legal ramifications; Practical requirements; Products and services; Risk and compliances; Security management; Service Level Agreements; Outsourcing"

We develop an analytical model in which a variety of factors are balanced to best manage the detection component within information security management. The approach not only considers conventional factors such as detection rate and false-positive rate, but also factors associated with hacker behavior that occur in response to improvements in the detection system made by the firm. Detection can be improved by increasing the system's discrimination ability (i.e., the ability to distinguish between attacks and normal usage) through the application of maintenance effort. The discrimination ability deteriorates over time due to changes in the environment. Also, there is the possibility of sudden shocks that can sharply degrade the discrimination ability. The firm's cost increases as hackers become more knowledgeable by disseminating security knowledge within the hacker population. The problem is solved to reveal the presence of a steady-state solution in which the level of system discrimination ability and maintenance effort are held constant. We find an interesting result where, under certain conditions, hackers do not benefit from disseminating security knowledge among one another. In other situations, we find that hackers benefit because the firm must lower its detection rate in the presence of knowledge dissemination. Other insights into managing detection systems are provided. For example, the presence of security shocks can increase or decrease the optimal discrimination level as compared to the optimal level without shocks. © 2011 INFORMS.","Hacker learning; Optimal security management; Security shocks; Variable attack rates","Industrial management; Security of data; Discrimination ability; Hacker learning; Information security managements; Knowledge dissemination; Optimal discriminations; Optimal security; Security shocks; Steady state solution; Personal computing"

Comparing to the traditional television, the IPTV combines the digital contents like media. The communication and the advertisement with the interaction serve into the emerging business model to provide the users to watch television service. Because the IPTV contains many merits; therefore, the world holds the high interest to develop of the IPTV. IPTV application scope is quite big, not only include wired and wireless, but also unify the telecommunication entrepreneur to provide the handset service, mobile device service and so on. It will be possible to affect the traditional television in the future, and even to displace it. If the user can use the IPTV effectively, it could be an enormous market. Generally, because the users' identities are easily exposed when Internet Protocol Television authenticate them, the best way to secure information security is to hide the identities of users. This paper will design the internet authentication system which is anonymous and secured. It can apply to solve the smart card duplication and the data resending attack problems.

Simultaneously, how to authenticate more efficiently by encryption in smart card authentication process is also our research objective. Further, this paper will contribute to how to build a security mechanism to prevent from the attacks. Based on those researches, this project plans to propose a new efficient and safe Internet Protocol Television.

In order to address the limitations of current approaches - scalability and impact analysis - we propose a novel framework to analyze massive amounts of alerts in real time, and measure the impact of current and future attacks. Our contribution is threefold. First, we introduce the notion of generalized dependency graph, which captures how network components depend on each other, and how the services offered by an enterprise depend on the underlying infrastructure. Second, we extend the classical definition of attack graph with the notion of timespan distribution, which encodes probabilistic knowledge of the attacker's behavior. Finally, we introduce attack scenario graphs, which combine dependency and attack graphs, bridging the gap between known vulnerabilities and the services that could be ultimately affected by the corresponding exploits.

Many of the proposed image encryption methods are based on shuffling the image pixels to make the relation between the encrypted and original images unclear. The shuffling-based methods with small key space, usually, lack the security, since knowing the encryption algorithm will help the hacker recover the original image. In this paper, a new image encryption algorithm with large key space is proposed which uses least square approximation techniques in the decrypting stage. The encrypted image is obtained through multiplying the original image by randomly generated vectors. At the receiver, least square approximation techniques are applied on the encrypted image and the randomly generated vectors to recover the original image. The method has been tested on a large number of images and the simulations show the effectiveness and the enhancement in security of the proposed algorithm. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Decryption; Image encryption; Information security; Least square error","Approximation algorithms; Image enhancement; Least squares approximations; Personal computing; Security of data; Decryption; Encrypted images; Encryption algorithms; Image encryption algorithm; Image encryptions; Least square approximations; Least square errors; Original images; Cryptography"

At the same time, states' military and intelligence organizations are increasingly developing the capability to attack and defend computer systems. The progress of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways, inflicting new forms of damage; technological change enables cyberwarfare acts that do not fit within existing legal categories, or may reveal contradictions among existing legal principles. The paper examines the relationship between information warfare and the law, especially international law and the law of war, as it is apparent that some fundamental questions regarding this new and emerging type of security threat need to be explored. For example, what types of activities between nation states, could or should be called information warfare? What are 'force', 'armed attack', or 'armed aggression' - terms from the UN Charter - in the Information Age, and do they equate to information warfare? Information warfare is neither 'armed' in the traditional sense, nor does it necessarily involve conflict, so an important issue is if 'war' between states necessarily require physical violence, kinetic energy, and human casualties. A threshold question that arises from the development of information warfare techniques is thus the definitional one: has the development of information warfare technology and techniques taken information warfare out of the existing legal definition of war? Characteristics of information technology and warfare pose problems to those who would use international law to limit information warfare, and leave legal space for those who would wage such warfare. Consequently, there may be confusion over what limits may apply to the conduct of information warfare, and when information warfare attacks may be carried out. Prospects of new technological attacks pose problems for international law because law is inherently conservative. From this point of view, the paper examines how the law itself might change in response to the fast development of information technology and how will long-established legal principles such as national sovereignty and the inviolability of national borders be affected by the ability of cyberspace to transcend such concepts.","Charter of the United Nations; Geneva conventions; Information warfare; International law; Use of force","Computers; Cybersecurity; Kinetics; Network security; Charter of the united nation; Cyberspaces; Electronic communications; Geneva convention; Information warfare; Legal issues; Legal principles; Military organizations; Use of force; Kinetic energy"

The untrusted COTS programs in the SLS partitions send at-level file edits as diff transactions to the TCB. The TCB verifies that BLP semantics will be observed and then patches these transactions into its canonical representation of the file. Finally, it releases appropriately filtered versions back to each SLS partition for re-assembly into the COTS program's standard file format. Furthermore, by judiciously restricting how the user can interact with the system the multiple SLS instantiations of the COTS program can be made to appear as if they are a single MLS instantiation.

Transmitted data readings are organised in groups of fixed length. The watermarking algorithm then reorders data readings relative to each other according to the value of the secret watermark. The proposed scheme tolerates minor changes that might be caused by channel error. In case of a single attack, the proposed technique can identify the victim element with high probability.

The use of wireless technology allows providers to adapt to the changing healthcare environment by reducing medical errors and increasing time for patient interaction. Advancements such as wireless capsule endoscopy provide innovative solutions to patient treatment. Such technological developments do not come without newfound risks. Among the biggest liabilities providers face in building a wireless strategy is information security and the incompatibility of older legacy health information systems. While the benefts of a wireless infrastructure may be signifcant, it is critical that hospital executives consider the enormous fnancial cost and implementation problems when creating a robust wireless infrastructure.

There is generally a lag time between the release and application of a technology till a shortcoming is observed. Once a shortcoming is revealed it is a race to address that potential weakness with improved policy, updated strategy, a technological initiative to combat the shortcoming, or a necessary combination of all methods. The invent of computer reliant and networked systems has created a modern arms race which has seen more innovation and more need for updated policy and strategy than any other period in history, yet the United States continues to fall behind in this arms race. When security cannot be verified, but only risk mitigated, it is time to think deterrence. Unfortunately, deterrence falls apart when you cannot identify the perpetrator behind attacks. This paper will look at the role that information has played in previous conflicts, as well as the modern strategy towards protecting the United States in cyberspace, and will draw a singular conclusion as to the best course of action towards improving our security. Through a mix of policy, strategy, and technology the anonymity which attackers use as a shield needs to be eliminated in order to allow room for a strong policy of deterrence with a verifiable response. In establishing the means to identify our attackers and provide serious recourse cybersecurity can be greatly improved for the United States.","History; Information security; Information warfare; Policy; Security; Strategy","Computer crime; Network security; Course of action; Cyber security; Cyberspaces; Cyberwarfare; Information warfare; Lag-time; Networked systems; Policy strategies; Security; Strategy; Cybersecurity"

Technically cyberterrorism can be carried out through various information security exploits like targeting Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems or Denial of Services attacks on critical governmental web sites. Various factors have an influence on cyberterrorism and include the social factors, capabilities, goals, modes of operation and practices. In order to analyse how these various factors influence the development of a cyberterrorist, a mapping to the Observe-Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) loop is proposed. The OODA loop, previously proposed by Col. John Boyd, provides an apt framework to structure and describe issues that contribute to the development and operation of a cyberterrorist. The aim of this paper is to describe how various observations made by sections of the world population direct people into making decisions and committing acts of cyberterror. The paper will thus look at issues like the environmental factors, social standing, culture, religion, tribal relations, loyalties, and the drive for power and self-fulfilment. In addition, the mapping will also consider how information is received, transformed and utilised by cyberterrorists, by considering the evolution of information in the Information Hierarchy. The proposed model will thus map various aspects pertinent to the field of cyberterrorism to capture a more dynamic representation of the interacting forces. The mapping will try to show the main relationships between the OODA loop, Information Hierarchy and various factors like characteristics, social factors, terrorist types, capabilities, goals, targets, attack levels, support functions, practices and modes of operation. Overall, the goal of this paper is to succinctly represent some of the psychological and technical issues relating to cyberterrorism. The OODA loop will be utilised to convey these ideas as well mapping to other relevant fields like the Information Hierarchy. Overall, various components that impact the field of cyberterrorism will be integrated to show a more holistic representation of various operating forces.","Cyberterrorism; Information hierarchy; OODA loop","Cybersecurity; Denial-of-service attack; Digital storage; SCADA systems; Terrorism; Cyber-terrorism; Cyberspaces; Denialof- service attacks; Development and operations; Information hierarchy; Level mapping; Mode of operations; Observe-orient, decide, act loop; Social factor; Web-sites; Mapping"

In this paper, we develop models to assess the risk of failure on the availability of an information network due to attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities. Software vulnerabilities arise from software installed on the nodes of the network. When the same software stack is installed on multiple nodes on the network, software vulnerabilities are shared among them. These shared vulnerabilities can result in correlated failure of multiple nodes resulting in longer repair times and greater loss of availability of the network. Considering positive network effects (e.g., compatibility) alone without taking the risks of correlated failure and the resulting downtime into account would lead to overinvestment in homogeneous software deployment. Exploiting characteristics unique to information networks, we present a queuing model that allows us to quantify downtime loss faced by arm as a function of (1) investment in security technologies to avert attacks, (2) software diversification to limit the risk of correlated failure under attacks, and (3) investment in IT resources to repair failures due to attacks. The novelty of this method is that we endogenize the failure distribution and the node correlation distribution, and show how the diversification strategy and other security measures/investments may impact these two distributions, which in turn determine the security loss faced by the firm. We analyze and discuss the effectiveness of diversification strategy under different operating conditions and in the presence of changing vulnerabilities. We also take into account the benefits and costs of a diversification strategy. Our analysis provides conditions under which diversification strategy is advantageous.","Correlated failures; Diversification; Downtime loss; Network effects; Risk management; Security; Software allocation","Information services; Queueing theory; Repair; Risk assessment; Risk management; Correlated failures; Different operating conditions; Diversification; Diversification strategies; Information security risk managements; Network effects; Security; Software vulnerabilities; Network security"

However, unlike purely static mechanisms for information security, hybrid information-flow monitors incur run-time overhead. We show how static analyses can be used to make hybrid information-flow monitors more efficient, in two ways. First, a simple static analysis can determine when it is sound for a monitor to stop tracking the security level of certain variables. This potentially reduces run-time overhead of the monitor, particularly in applications where sensitive (i.e., confidential or untrusted) data is infrequently introduced to the system. Second, we derive sufficient conditions for soundly incorporating a wide range of memory abstractions into information-flow monitors. This allows the selection of a memory abstraction that gives an appropriate tradeoff between efficiency and precision. It also facilitates the development of innovative and sound memory abstractions that use run-time security information maintained by the monitor. We present and prove our results by extending the information-flow monitor of Russo and Sabelfeld (2010).

The market success of the enterprises depends on the ability to support their business processes. A possibility for exploring ways of this support is to extend information security - IT audit knowledge base to the top management, as tools for improving operations. This might even propagate to the staff the strategic importance of these disciplines, beyond the compliance to laws, and to the requirements of government administration. An illustration of the method is the improvement of corporate operations even during an outsource process. Top management usually decides to outsource an activity to spare at least some of its costs. Unfortunately, in quite a lot of cases, beyond a decrease in headcount - that looks nice at the stock exchanges, anyway - otsource does not yield other benefits. Even the quality of the outsourced services might deteriorate. In the followings examples for the identification of such corporate activities will be presented, and the way of exploring their desirable characteristics will be shown, that might help not only in avoiding disadvantages of outsource, but even in gaining advantages for both sides: to the customer and to the supplier just as well. © 2011 International Business Information Management Association.","Best professional practice of information security and IT audit; Operational excellence; Outsourcing operational activities","Information management; Knowledge based systems; Outsourcing; Security of data; Business Process; Corporate governance; Government administration; IT audit; Knowledge base; Operational activity; Operational excellence; Stock exchange; Industrial management"

Moderators are modelled as leukocytes that remove infected cells. The identification of infected cells is supported by a feedback mechanism that allows posters to rate both other posters and the performance of the moderators. To achieve an adaptive moderation, an artificial lymphatic system, modifies the group of moderators with the aim of improving the immune response when needed.

Most of the existing research in assistive healthcare follows a more passive approach and has focused on collecting and processing data using a static-topology and an application-aware infrastructure. However, with the technological advances in sensing, computation, storage, and communications, a new era is about to emerge changing the traditional view of sensor-based assistive environments where people are passive data consumers, with one where people carry mobile sensing elements involving large volumes of data related to everyday human activities. This evolution will be driven by people-centric sensing and will turn mobile phones into global mobile sensing devices enabling thousands new personal, social, and public sensing applications. In this paper, we discuss our vision for people-centric sensing in assistive healthcare environments and study the security challenges it brings. This highly dynamic and mobile setting presents new challenges for information security, data privacy and ethics, caused by the ubiquitous nature of data traces originating from sensors carried by people. We aim to instigate discussion on these critical issues because people-centric sensing will never succeed without adequate provisions on security and privacy. To that end, we discuss the latest advances in security and privacy protection strategies that hold promise in this new exciting paradigm. We hope this work will better highlight the need for privacy in people-centric sensing applications and spawn further research in this area. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Assistive healthcare; Location and context-awareness; Mobile handsets; Participatory sensing; Security and privacy policies","Computer privacy; Data privacy; Digital storage; Telephone sets; Ubiquitous computing; Assistive; Context- awareness; Mobile handsets; Participatory Sensing; Security and privacy; mHealth"

Merchants dealing with credit cards have to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) or face penalties for non-compliance. With more transactions based on credit cards, merchants are finding it costly and increasingly difficult to implement and interpret the PCI standard. One of the top reasons cited for merchants to fail PCI audit, and a leading factor in data theft, is the failure to adequately protect stored cardholder data. Although implementation of the PCI DSS is not a guarantee for perfect protection, effective implementation of the PCI standards can be ensured through the divergence of the PCI standard into wider information security governance to provide a comprehensive overview of information security based not only on security but also security audit and control. The contribution of this paper is the development of an integrated comprehensive security governance framework for 'information security' (rather than data protection) incorporating Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT), Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and ISO 27002.

Information security becomes very significant in data storage and transmission. However, widespread popularity of wireless data communication gadgets, integrated with the availability of higher bandwidths, has led to an increased user demand for multi media content rich information and images. To make the cipher more robust against any attack, the confidential key created must have high randomness. One has to be very cautious in constructing the cryptographic keys and its algorithm. The Chaotic - maps are the best alternatives for generation of random secret keys, since they have desirable properties of ergodicity and high sensitivity to initial conditions and other control parameters. Most chaotic- maps are as equivalent as traditional pseudo - random secret keys for multimedia content rich in data encryption. In this paper, we have presented two different approaches, new permutation-substitution based random sequence generation from an image pixel and blended chaotic Blum Blum Shub. A new approach is proposed to generate a random-bit sequence with a high degree of randomness. The proposed algorithm is a better alternative to satisfy the need for information security services. In this regard, we have developed an algorithm for the generation of random sequence of length 256 bit by shuffling and blending of image pixel based on Base 64 encoding and integrated chaotic Blum Blum Shub generator. The performance analysis of the proposed new approach is tested for randomness by carrying out various testing rules and statistical test on encrypted various images. Results of the various types of analysis are encouraging and imply that the proposed approach is very successfully able to meet the trade offs between the speed and protection. Hence it is suitable for the real-time secure transmission of image and video communication applications. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.","Base 64 encoding; Blum Blum Shub; Chaotic maps and Image based Cryptosystem; Random number generation",""

In the pursuit for better authentication approaches, few schools have implemented students' authentication during online exams beyond passwords. This paper aims to assess e-learners' intention to provide multibiometric data and use of multibiometrics during online exams. Design/methodology/approach: Based on data collected from 163 e-learners from two institutions, the authors compared such measures when provided by their university versus by a third-party service vendor. The multibiometrics discussed included fingerprint, face, and voice recognition. Findings: The results show a clear indication by the learners that they are significantly more willing to provide their biometric data and intend to use multibiometrics when provided by their university compared with same services provided by a third-party vendor. Research limitations/implications: Research implications include the need for better understanding of multibiometrics implementations in educational settings. Practical implications: The findings are profound for vendors of multibiometrics as they must adjust their approach when implementing such technologies at higher educational institutions, rather than simply opt to license the use of such solutions and to host them. Originality/value: This study helps higher educational institutions better understand that learners do not appear to object to the use of multibiometrics technologies during online exams, rather the way in which such technologies are implemented and managed on-campus. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Biometrics; Data security; E-learning; Higher education",""

If these two stages are combined, the duplicated scanning effort can be reduced and the encryption can be accelerated. In this paper, a fast image encryption algorithm with combined permutation and diffusion is proposed. First, the image is partitioned into blocks of pixels. Then, spatiotemporal chaos is employed to shuffle the blocks and, at the same time, to change the pixel values. Meanwhile, an efficient method for generating pseudorandom numbers from spatiotemporal chaos is suggested, which further increases the encryption speed.

Parallel implementations on the Tilera 64-core System on Chip and the Xilinx Virtex 5-LX FPGA are presented. For the Tilera, we employ a reduced state machine to recognize dictionary terms without requiring explicit tokenization, and achieve throughput of 37 MB/s at a slightly reduced accuracy. For the FPGA, we have developed a set of software tools to help automate the process of converting training data to synthesizable hardware and to provide a means of trading off between accuracy and resource utilization. The Xilinx Virtex 5-LX implementation requires 0.2% of the memory used by the original algorithm. At 166 MB/s (80X the software) the hardware implementation is able to achieve Gigabit network throughput at the same accuracy as the original algorithm. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Materials and methods: A pilot project was conducted in 2008-2009 at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington. Our PHR was architected to a flexible platform that incorporated standards-based models of Continuity of Document and Continuity of Care Record to map Department of Defense-sourced health data, via a secure Veterans Administration data broker, to Microsoft® HealthVault and Google® Health based on user preference. The project design and implementation were guided by provider and patient advisory panels with formal user evaluation. Results: The pilot project included 250 beneficiary users. Approximately 73.2% of users were <65 years of age, and 38.4% were female. Of the users, 169 (67.6%) selected Microsoft® HealthVault, and 81 (32.4%) selected Google® Health as their PHR of preference. Sample evaluation of users reflected 100% (n=60) satisfied with convenience of record access and 91.7% (n=55) satisfied with overall functionality of PHR. Discussion: Key lessons learned related to data-transfer decisions (push vs pull), purposeful delays in reporting sensitive information, understanding and mapping PHR use and clinical workflow, and decisions on information patients may choose to share with their provider. Conclusion: Currently PHRs are being viewed as empowering tools for patient activation. Design and implementation issues (eg, technical, organizational, information security) are substantial and must be thoughtfully approached. Adopting standards into design can enhance the national goal of portability and interoperability.","","Adult; Aged; Electronic Health Records; Feasibility Studies; Female; Health Records, Personal; Hospitals, Military; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Military Personnel; Patient Preference; Pilot Projects; Software; United States; Washington; access to information; adult; article; comparative effectiveness; data analysis; female; human; information retrieval; major clinical study; male; medical informatics; medical record; military service; pilot study; United States"

Such huge traffic makes an adversary's job impractical to investigate all of them and allows communicating parties to establish a secure covert channel to transmit steganographic covers. This renders summaries an attractive steganographic carrier. Therefore, summarisation-based steganography methodology (Sumstega), presented in this paper, takes advantage of the automatic summarisation techniques to generate summary-cover. Sumstega neither hides data in a noise nor produces noise. Instead, Sumstega manipulates the parameters and factors of automatic summarisation techniques in order to embed data without noise, which retains adequate rooms for concealing data. The validation demonstrates the capability of achieving the steganographic goal.

Based on Da Veiga and Eloff's (2007) framework for security governance and two high-level information security documents published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the authors present seven domains of information security governance. For each of the governance domains, they propose a main decision type, using the taxonomy of information technology decisions defined by Weill and Ross (2004). This framework recommends the selection of decision rights allocation patterns that are proper to those decision types to ensure good security decisions. As a result, a balance can be achieved between decisional authority and responsibility for information security.

To illustrate this, Orwell created the idea of newspeak, and the telescreen which made it possible to observe (interception) others' thoughts. The purpose of this essay is to draw attention to the disturbing fact that Orwell's 60 years old dystopia is an everyday reality of the 21st century's e-society. This is demonstrated both in documentary evidence and in scientific and technological developments. Moreover, the technological developments of the 20th century, unimaginable to Orwell, have exceeded the original dystopia: today's reality includes ECHELON, Carnivore, RFID; in other words GLOBAL BIG BROTHER.

Many visible watermarking techniques have been studied for text documents but there are very few for web based text. XML files are used to trade information on the internet and contain important information. In this paper, two invisible watermarking techniques using Synonyms and Acronyms are proposed for XML files to prove the intellectual ownership and to achieve the security.

In this model, a collection of subsets of the channels in the network is given, and a wiretapper is allowed to access any one (but not more than one) of these subsets without being able to obtain any information about the message transmitted. Our model includes secret sharing in classical cryptography as a special case. We present a construction of secure linear network codes that can be used provided a certain graph-theoretic condition is satisfied. We also prove the necessity of this condition for the special case that the wiretapper may choose to access any subset of channels of a fixed size. The optimality of our code construction is established for this special case.

In this paper, we study the stock market reactions to information-security-related events using the event analysis methodology with consideration of the effects of a number of contingency factors, including business type, industry, type of breach, event year, and length of event window. We found that pure e-commerce firms experienced higher negative market reactions than traditional bricks-and-mortar firms in the event of security breach. We also found that denial of service attacks had higher negative impact than other types of security breaches. Finally, security events occurred in recent years were found to have less significant impact than those occurred earlier, suggesting that investors may have become less sensitive to the security events. Most interestingly, our analyses showed that the magnitude and longevity of security breaches vary with time across sub-samples. This raises some serious questions regarding the validity of analyzing only short-term stock market reactions as an indicator of the cost of security breaches, and in general, an indicator of the value of IT-related events.

The telecommunications can be set using the classical cryptography. But this so-called classical cryptography provides cryptographic security. This means that security is based on the difficulty of some mathematics problems. On the other hand, quantum cryptography provides security without conditions based on the law of quantum physics. This method, called the theoretic information security is evidenced using the theory of information. Approach: In this study, we study whether quantum cryptography can be applied in the frame of the satellite telecommunications network. To do this in our project, we present theories regarding the following issues: Telecommunications Station and Satellite Communication Networks, Quantum Key Distribution, Open Space and Satellites, Analyses in different Scenarios between the Satellite and Earth station. Results: Quantum communications offers many advantages for secure data transmission, in our implementation study, we presented different scenarios of quantum key exchange between satellites and ground stations for possible approach to subsystem with quantum communication in space, capable of generating and detecting entangled photons as well as faint laser pulses. Conclusion: The use of satellites to distribute quantum photon provides a unique solution for long-distance. Moreover, quantum cryptography is a satisfactory solution to improve the safety problem. So, the quantum transmissions are the future of telecommunications. © 2010 Science Publications.","Classical cryptography; Laser transmission; Quantum cryptography; Quantum key distribution; Quantum physics; Satellite networks; Satellite transmission; Telecommunications network; Telecommunications station",""

In the addition operation, Many ECC designs that use projective coordinates over GF (p) have not considered a balance between area, hardware utilization, and performance factors which is important in many ECC applications. In this research we proposed to use the projective coordinates systems to compute the ECC point addition operation with no inversion operations due to the ability to convert each inversion to several multiplication operations that can be applied in parallel. We also present several architectures and design choices for point addition operation that will help to build ECC Coprocessor. These architectures consider different levels of parallelism which may give different choices in ECC design in terms of time and space. This paper proposes the different hardware architectures to design ECC Processor by varying the degree of parallelization benefiting from the inherent parallelism for ECC addition operation. It was shown that the throughput of the design with 4 parallel multipliers enhanced the system performance by 400% and 340% for both projections (X/Z, Y/Z), and (X/Z2, Y/Z3) respectively while the design with 5 parallel multipliers is considered the best fit for projection (X/Z, Y/Z2) due its ability to best utilize and parallelize the hardware arithmetic operations. However, the projection (X/Z, Y/Z) when applied using 4 parallel multipliers gave the best results in terms of hardware utilization, parallelization enhancements and cost factor which make it the first choice when you design the ECC Coprocessor using projective coordinates. A trade-off between security, area and performance is which control the ECC Coprocessor design, the more parallelization you make the more area needed the less time required which will lead to a better performance. © 2011 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","Elliptic Curves Cryptography; Point Addition; Projective Coordinates","Architecture; Computer architecture; Hardware; Network architecture; Security of data; Arithmetic computations; Arithmetic operations; Best fit; Co-processors; Cost factors; Elliptic curve; Elliptic curves cryptography; Hardware architecture; Hardware utilization; Inherent parallelism; Modular inversion; Multiplication operations; Parallel multipliers; Parallelizations; Performance factors; Point additions; Projective Coordinates; Design"

Because of the esoteric nature of the subject and, until recently, the very difficult access to reference materials, knowledge of these provisions was confined to a handful of scholars. Design/methodology/approach: To prepare this article, it was necessary to download the entire new ITU History Portal collection of treaty instruments, adding the US archive collection scans of missing documents, conversion to plain text, identification and linking of key provisions across time, detecting the differences, and then pursuing related material to find out why the text arose. Findings: What the material reveals is a 150-year history of cybersecurity law that is not only relevant to significant developments today, but also controlling as a set of obligations that virtually every nation has accepted. Research limitations/implications: It is hoped that this article will not only be helpful going forward in dealing with the difficult challenges of evolving these provisions, but will also serve as a kind of template for a new generation that not only questions authority, but also appreciates the value of source materials, accessing them, and doing the necessary analysis rather than just visiting a search engine.

In the model, the inter packets delay is used to transmit covert information, and the acknowledge packet of HTTP protocol works as a confirmation of the covert information, which forms a bidirectional covert channel. A reliable communication protocol, which keeps the transmitter and the receiver of the covert information to be synchronization, is designed to ensure the stability of RCTC. To improve the efficiency of covert channel, the encode way of covert information is analyzed, and the scheme of ""2-bits to one inter packets delay"" is adopted. The capacity of RCTC is deduced based on queue theory. The experimental environment of RCTC in the Internet is constructed and several experiments of covert communication with the channel are conducted. The results show that the capacity of RCTC is about 11 times of that of traditional timing channel, the robustness of the channel is much better than that of traditional timing covert channel, and the channel can maintain reliable even when the quality of network communication is poor.","Covert channel; Information security; Network security; Robustness; Steganography","Communication; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Internet; Internet protocols; Steganography; Telecommunication networks; Covert channels; Covert communications; Covert timing channels; Experimental environment; HTTP protocols; Information security; Network communications; Packets delay; Queue theory; Reliable communication; Robustness; Timing channels; Network security"

To implement an elective course in pharmacogenomics designed to teach pharmacy students about the fundamentals of pharmacogenomics and the anticipated changes it will bring to the profession. Design. The 8 sessions of the course covered the basics of pharmacogenomics, genomic biotechnology, implementation of pharmacogenetics in pharmacy, information security and privacy, ethical issues related to the use of genomic data, pharmacoepidemiology, and use and promotion of GeneScription, a software program designed to mimic the professional pharmacy environment. Assessment. Student grades were based on completion of a patient education pamphlet, a 2-page paper on pharmacogenomics, and precourse and postcourse survey instruments. In the postcourse survey, all students strongly agreed that genomic data could be used to determine the optimal dose of a drug and genomic data for metabolizing enzymes could be stored in a safe place. Students also were more willing to submit deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) data for genetic profiling and better understood how DNA analysis is performed after completing the course. Conclusions. An elective course in pharmacogenomics equipped pharmacy students with the basic knowledge necessary to make clinical decisions based on pharmacogenomic data and to teach other healthcare professionals and patients about pharmacogenomics. For personalized medicine to become a reality, all pharmacists and pharmacy students must learn this knowledge and these skills.","Drug safety; Instructional software; Personalized medicine; Pharmacogenomics","Computer-Assisted Instruction; Curriculum; Education, Pharmacy; Educational Measurement; Humans; Individualized Medicine; Pharmacists; Pharmacogenetics; Professional Role; Software; Students, Pharmacy; drug safety; instructional software; personalized medicine; pharmacogenomics; article; computer program; curriculum; drug safety; education; human; instructional software; methodology; organization and management; personalized medicine; pharmacist; pharmacogenetics; pharmacogenomics; pharmacy student; professional standard; teaching"

The Tag and the Verifier maintain a vector of n entries that is repeatedly refreshed by pairwise xoring entries, with a new vector of n entries that is randomly chosen by the Tag and sent to the Verifier as a part of each communication session. The general case in which the adversary does not listen in k≥1 sessions among any n successive communication sessions is also considered.

Furthermore, recent computer attacks such as the Stuxnet worm, have shown there are parties with the motivation and resources to effectively attack control systems. While previous work has proposed new security mechanisms for control systems, few of them have explored new and fundamentally different research problems for securing control systems when compared to securing traditional information technology (IT) systems. In particular, the sophistication of new malware attacking control systems-malware including zero-days attacks, rootkits created for control systems, and software signed by trusted certificate authorities-has shown that it is very difficult to prevent and detect these attacks based solely on IT system information. In this paper we show how, by incorporating knowledge of the physical system under control, we are able to detect computer attacks that change the behavior of the targeted control system. By using knowledge of the physical system we are able to focus on the final objective of the attack, and not on the particular mechanisms of how vulnerabilities are exploited, and how the attack is hidden. We analyze the security and safety of our mechanisms by exploring the effects of stealthy attacks, and by ensuring that automatic attack-response mechanisms will not drive the system to an unsafe state. A secondary goal of this paper is to initiate the discussion between control and security practitioners-two areas that have had little interaction in the past. We believe that control engineers can leverage security engineering to design-based on a combination of their best practices-control algorithms that go beyond safety and fault tolerance, and include considerations to survive targeted attacks.

The collaboration rules that typically govern large science experiments as well as social networks of scientists span across the institutional security boundaries. A common concern is that the increased openness may allow malicious attackers to spread more readily around the grid. We consider how to optimally respond to attacks in open grid environments. To show how and why attacks spread more readily around the grid, we first discuss how collaborations manifest themselves in the grids and form the collaboration network graph, and how this collaboration network graph affects the security threat levels of grid participants. We present two mixed-integer program (MIP) models to find the optimal response to attacks in open grid environments, and also calculate the threat level associated with each grid participant. Given an attack scenario, our optimal response model aims to minimize the threat levels at unaffected participants while maximizing the uninterrupted scientific production (continuing collaborations). By adopting some of the collaboration rules (e.g., suspending a collaboration or shutting down a site), the model finds optimal response to subvert an attack scenario. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Existing detecting methods such as Hurst parameter method and Markov model must ensure that the network traffic signal f (t) is a stationary signal. But its stability is just a regular assumption and has no strict mathematical proof. Therefore methods mentioned above lack of reliable theoretical support. This article introduces Hilbert- HuangTtransformation(HHT) . HHT does not need to be based on signal stability, but it monitors the similarity between Hilbert marginal spectrums of adjacent observation sequences so as to realize DDoS detection. The method is experimented on DARPA 1999 data and simulating data respectively. Experimental results show that the method behaves better than existing Hurst parameter method in distinguishing both the normal and the attacked traffic.","DDoS detection; HHT; Marginal hilbert spectrum; Similarity",""

Since the number of small odd primes used in the trial division affects the performance of the combination, researchers have studied how to obtain the optimal number of small odd primes to be used in the trial division and the expected running time of the combination for primality tests. However, in the case of safe primality tests, the analysis of the combination is more difficult, and thus no such results have been given. In this paper, we present the first probabilistic analysis on the expected running time and the optimal number of small odd primes to be used in the trial division for optimizing the tests.

Preserving user identity and limiting the access of web resources only to the humans and restricting 'bots' is an ever challenging area of study. With the increase in computing power and development of newer approaches towards circumvention and reverse-engineering, the recognition gap present between the machines and the humans is said to be decreasing. Turing test and its modified versions are in place to deal with such problems and ways to resolve them by developing complex algorithms for bot prevention systems like CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). This paper will deal with the use of ""Machine Vision"" for judging the ability of the machines to compete with humans in breaking sequences of security systems like CAPTCHA. Reverse Turing test will be put to practise here. Complex image recognition technologies and novel approaches towards using Human interactive proofs (HIP) are discussed. The progress of Turing test over the past 60 years has been paid due attention at the end.

This study has three major findings. First, the impact of the broad class of information security breaches on stock market returns of firms is significant. Second, when breaches are classified by their primary effect in terms of (i) confidentiality, (ii) availability or (iii) integrity, attacks associated with breaches of availability are seen to have the greatest negative effect on stock market returns. Third, there has been a significant downward shift in the impact of the security breaches in the sub-period following the 9/11/2001 attacks versus the impact in the pre-9/11 period. Apparently, with increased media reporting of information security breaches without apparent devastating effects on targeted corporations, investors lowered their assessment of the costs of such breaches. Two possible reasons for this downward shift are (1) more effective remediation and disaster recovery and (2) a perceived decrease in the tendency of customers to refrain from doing business with firms experiencing an information security breach. © 2011 IOS Press and the authors.

Confidential data such as military secrets or intellectual property must never be disclosed outside the organization. Therefore, one of the most severe threats in the case of cyber-insider attacks is the loss of confidential data due to exfiltration. A malicious insider who has the proper credentials to access the organization databases may, over time, send data outside the organization network through a variety of channels, such as email, crafted HTTP requests that encapsulate data, etc. Existing security tools for detection of cyber-attacks focus on protecting the boundary between the organization and the outside world. Numerous network-level intrusion detection systems (IDS) exist, which monitor the traffic pattern and attempt to infer anomalous behavior. While such tools may be effective in protecting against external attacks, they are less suitable when the data exfiltration is performed by an insider who has the proper credentials and authorization to access resources within the organization. In this paper, we argue that DBMS-layer detection and prevention systems are the best alternative to defend against data exfiltration because: (1) DBMS access is performed through a standard, unique language (SQL) with well-understood semantics; (2) monitoring the potential disclosure of confidential data is more effective if done as close as possible to the data source; and (3) the DBMS layer already has in place a thorough mechanism for enforcing access control based on subject credentials. By analyzing the pattern of interaction between subjects and the DBMS, it is possible to detect anomalous activity that is indicative of early signs of exfiltration. In the paper, we outline a taxonomy of cyber-insider dimensions of activities that are indicative of data exfiltration, and we discuss a high-level architecture and mechanisms for early detection of exfiltration by insiders. We also outline a virtualization-based mechanism that prevents insiders from exfiltrating data, even in the case when they manage to gain control over the network. The protection mechanism relies on explicit authorization of data transfers that cross the organizational boundary.

In these networks, sensor nodes are typically sprinkled liberally in the field in order to monitor, gather, disseminate, and provide the sensed data to the command node. Various studies have focused on key establishment schemes in homogeneous WSNs. However, recent research has shown that achieving survivability in WSNs requires a hierarchy and heterogeneous infrastructure. In this paper, to address security issues in the heterogeneous WSNs, we propose a secure clustering scheme along with a deterministic pairwise key management scheme based on public key cryptography. The proposed security mechanism guarantees that any two sensor nodes located in the same cluster and routing path can directly establish a pairwise key without disclosing any information to other nodes. Through security performance evaluation, it is shown that the proposed scheme guarantees node-to-node authentication, high resiliency against node capture, and minimum memory space requirement. © 2011 Reza Azarderskhsh and Arash Reyhani-Masoleh.","","Public key cryptography; Security of data; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless networks; Clustering scheme; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; Information security; Key establishments; Memory space; Pairwise key; Performance evaluation; Research challenges; Routing path; Security issues; Security mechanism; Symmetric keys; Wireless sensor networks"

As the old grid is rapidly being replaced with smart grid technology, a critical shortfall in workforce training and education has been identified; that is, there is a lack of well-trained, highly skilled electric power sector workers who are vital to deploying and maintaining a national clean-energy smart grid. © 2011 IEEE.","","Gas emissions; Power generation; Productivity; Systems analysis; Aging infrastructure; Cyber security; Data entries; Database administrators; Economic productivity; Electric power sector; Energy industry; Energy infrastructures; Greenhouse-gas emissions; Infrastructure improvements; IT system; Job creation; Manufacturing workers; Paradigm shifts; Power grids; Power systems; Smart grid; Tipping point; U.S. Department of Energy; Workforce training; Investments"

However, the importance of the physical gap's quality and stability continue to grow with the intensification of competition in the marketplace.

One of the reasons is a lack of methodology for asset analysis, which is an important process of risk assessment. As the features of IEC 61850-based power control systems are different from general IT systems, a specific methodology of asset analysis is introduced. Based on the requirements of risk assessment proposed in the BS ISO/IEC 27005 standard, the methodology for asset analysis is separated into asset identification and valuation. For asset identification, a structured asset model is defined to distinguish the assets, and a function-oriented business process model is defined to identify the business process and describe the relations between assets and business processes. For asset valuation, in order to objectively reflect the consequence incurred due to the loss of security properties, three levels of value are defined, which is value of information exchange, asset value of function level, and asset value of system level, respectively. Finally, the implementation procedure of the methodology is described. In the companion paper (Part II), an application instance is presented to support the usefulness of the methodology. © 2010 IEEE.","Asset identification; asset valuation; cyber security; power control system; risk assessment","Control system analysis; Electric substations; Identification (control systems); Power control; Rating; Risk analysis; Security of data; Asset identification; asset valuation; Asset value; Business Process; Business process model; cyber security; IEC 61850; Information security risk assessment; ISO/IEC; IT system; Security properties; System levels; Unsolved problems; Value of information; Risk assessment"

The paper also examines user characteristics including IT proficiency and risk propensity, which give rise to individual differences in such attitudes. Design/methodology/approach - To capture user attitudes toward a security measure, a construct called ""information security readiness"" (ISR) and its corresponding measurement items were developed. Observations were collected from a laboratory experiment based on a 2 × 3 factorial design, with data criticality and security level as the treatment variables. The participants were undergraduate students of a major American university. The moderating effect of data criticality on the relationship between security level and ISR was tested with multi-group structural equation modeling. In addition to the treatment variables, IT proficiency and risk propensity were included as covariates in the analysis. Findings - The results revealed a nonlinear relationship between security level and ISR. For data of high criticality, enhancing security level had a positive impact on ISR, but only up to the point perceived as appropriate by the participants. For data of low criticality, the enhancement of security level was perceived as unnecessary. In addition, IT proficiency was found to be a significant covariate, especially when data criticality was high. Practical implications - In practice, the specification of a security measure requires a trade-off between the utility of the data protected and the usability of the security method. The measure of ISR provides a means to locate the equilibrium by examining user attitudes across different security levels in relation to a particular level of data criticality. The significance of IT proficiency demonstrates the importance of user training. Originality/value - This study introduces the ISR construct to capture evaluation, power, and activity dimensions underlying an individual's cognitive beliefs, affective responses, and behavioral inclinations toward the adoption of security measures. The results provide interesting insights into the role of interaction between security level and data criticality in influencing ISR. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Data security; Information technology; Risk management","Criticality (nuclear fission); Information technology; Risk analysis; Risk management; Students; Affective response; Covariates; Data security; Design/methodology/approach; Factorial design; Individual Differences; Information security; Laboratory experiments; Moderating effect; Multi-group; Non-linear relationships; Security level; Security measure; Security methods; Structural equation modeling; Undergraduate students; User attitudes; User characteristics; User training; Security of data"

The only software component that is trusted in the system during runtime is XTRec itself, which contains only 2,195 lines of code permitting manual audits to ensure security and safety. We use XTRec to show whether a particular code has been executed on a system, or conversely to prove that some malware has not executed on the system. This is a highly desirable property to ensure information assurance, especially in critical e-government infrastructure. Our experimental results show that the imposed overhead is 2x-4x for real-world applications. This overhead is primarily due to CPU Branch Trace Messages(BTM), a ubiquitous debugging feature used to record control-flow instructions. Hardware improvements to BTM would therefore enable XTRec to run with minimal overhead. © 2011 IEEE.","","Systems science; Computing system; Control-flow; e-Government; Execution trace; Information assurance; Instruction-level; Lines of code; Malwares; Real time execution; Real-world application; Runtimes; Software component; Critical infrastructures"

Moreover, relation between money and malware becomes more complex. Many kinds of malware bear bots to get springboards. Meanwhile, for ordinary internet users, countermeasures against malware come up against a blank wall. Pattern matching becomes too much waste of computer resources, since matching tools have to deal with a lot of patterns derived from subspecies. Virus making tools can automatically bear subspecies of malware. Moreover, metamorphic and polymorphic malware are no longer special. Recently there appears malware checking sites that check contents in place of users' PC. However, there appears a new type of malicious sites that avoids check by malware checking sites.

As interoperability is the primary focus of our study and it is a broad concept, we restrict our discussion to holistic frameworks and models. In this regard, we survey the prominent holistic approaches namely Gartner, SABSA, RISE frameworks, AGM-based model and intelligent Service-Oriented EISA. In the next step, we compare the mentioned frameworks from technical, organizational and semantic interoperability aspects. We conclude that none of the frameworks, not even those which are holistic, practical and greatly elaborated, have explored interoperability clearly. We assert that the competitive advantages offered by interoperability, justify the costs needed for implementing the incompatible concepts of interoperability and security along with each other. In addition, we suggest that the requirements which are common to both interoperability and security should be extracted and the significance of interoperability to EISA should be apprehended © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Architecture framework; Enterprise architecture (EA); Enterprise information security (EIS); Enterprise information security architecture (EISA); Enterprise security management (ESM); Information security management (ISM); Interoperability","Architecture; Competition; Electrochemical corrosion; Industrial management; Industry; Information management; Information technology; Interoperability; Semantics; Architecture frameworks; Enterprise architecture; Enterprise information security (EIS); Enterprise information security architecture (EISA); Enterprise security management (ESM); Information security management (ISM); Security of data"

Companies need to examine themselves from two main perspectives, and not rely on threat information. The first is related to the objectives of the company and second is from a vulnerability assessment/evaluation arena. Critical infrastructure companies need to examine their systems looking for vulnerabilities, determine the consequences/impacts to the company's operations of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability, and determine the capabilities that are necessary to successfully exploit the vulnerability. Another area where critical infrastructure companies can gather information, used to convince managers to authorize the implementation of cybersecurity defenses, is to examine real-world industrial incidents and see if a purely cyber scenario resulting in the same consequences can be extrapolated.","","Public works; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Industrial incidents; Real-world; Critical infrastructures"

In some cases, secret information needs to be covertly broadcast to receivers in multiple locations at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel steganographic scheme, which covertly sends secret message to multiple receivers via a stream of running short text messages displayed on a media output screen, assuming appropriate optical character recognition (OCR) functionality at the decoder. We use Thai language short text messages as a case study. We analyze the characteristics of Thai short text messages and introduce some effective message-to-bit transformation methods. We find that one Thai short text message can be transformed into multiple secret bits. In principle, the proposed transformation methods can be applied to short text messages in any language. We use a provably secure construction that guarantees covertness, privacy, and authenticity of the secret data against active attacks. In an experimental evaluation, we show that four secret message bits can be embedded in each short text message. In addition, we find that the embedded bits can be retrieved correctly and easily by human observers without OCR functionality at the decoder. Thus, the scheme is practical and effective for covert communication from one sender to multiple receivers over public channels. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Covert communication; Information hiding; Information security; Steganography; Text steganography","Communication; Decoding; Optical character recognition; Signal receivers; Telephone systems; Active attack; Covert communications; Encrypted messages; Experimental evaluation; Human observers; Information hiding; Information security; Multiple receivers; Provably secure; Secret data; Secret information; Secret messages; Steganographic schemes; Text messages; Text steganography; Thai language; Transformation methods; Steganography"

We motivate the event-driven paradigm and take healthcare as a running example, because the confidentiality of healthcare data must be guaranteed over many years. We first consider how to enforce authorisation policy at the client level through parametrised role-based access control (RBAC), taking context into account.

The basic idea to resolve this issue is to monitor the trap-free cells among a plurality of prepared cells. The integrated batteryless electron timer is composed of a plurality of single-polysilicon-type solid-state aging devices that are connected in parallel. The first sample is fabricated in a standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process, and the measurements clearly exhibit the first evidence that we succeeded to remove the trap-detrapping- related fluctuation in the ticking operation.

This new book examines the cybersecurity research roadmap in order to define a national R&D agenda that is required to enable us to get ahead of our adversaries and produce the technologies that will protect our information systems and networks into the future. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

While the US HIPAA legislation on privacy and security went into effect over five years ago, healthcare information security remains a significant concern as organizations migrate to electronic health records. The recent HITECH legislation aimed at accelerating this migration contained mandates for greater security, including the addition of new requirements on breach reporting. We overview this legislation and examine a recently collected sample of inadvertently disclosed files found on internet-based file-sharing networks. We characterize the security risk of these files and also present evidence of the threat by analyzing user-issued searches. Our analysis indicates that the threat and vulnerability for the healthcare sector continued, even as HITECH became effective. © 2011 IEEE.","","Health care; Health risks; Hospital data processing; Internet; Records management; Security of data; Systems science; Electronic health record; File sharing networks; Healthcare sectors; Hi-tech; Information security; Internet based; Patient data; Patient health; Privacy and security; Security risks; Electronic document exchange"

Information security is a way to protect information against its confidentiality, reliability and availability. Hiding exchange of information is an important factor in the field of security. Cryptography and Steganography are two very important methods for this purpose and are both used to ensure data confidentiality. In Steganography a cover media is used to hide the existence of data where cryptography is used to protect information by transferring plain text into cipher text. Different methods have been studied for multimedia objects but there are very few methods for hiding information into text without altering its integrity. Web based attacks have been a very common practice in recent years and hence need strong security mechanisms for the sake of secret communication. Many robust algorithms can be developed using text Steganography for web pages as they contain a wide amount of bandwidth. A few techniques using web tools like HTML and XML have been proposed but they do not make use of features of these languages very well. This paper discusses some proposed methods, implementations of different embedding techniques and two different ways for hiding data and also a comparative analysis is made based upon some security variables.

Recently, many people have come to realize that failure detection ought to be provided as some form of generic service, similar to IP address lookup. However, this has not been successful so far; one of the reasons distributed systems. We first identify some of the most important QoS problems raised in the context of large wide area distributed systems. Then we present a novel failure detector scheme combined with self-tuning control theory that can help in solving or optimizing some of these problems. Furthermore, this paper discusses the design and analysis of implementing a scalable failure detection service for such large wide-area distributed systems considering dynamically adjusting the heartbeat streams, so that it satisfies the bottleneck router requirements. The basic z-transformation stability test is used to achieve the stability criterion, which ensures the bounded rate allocation with out steady state oscillation. We further show how the online failure detector control algorithm can be used to design a controller, analyze the theoretical aspects of the proposed algorithm and verify its agreement with the simulations in the LAN and WAN case.

With the widespread utilization of information technology applications, organizations are becoming more aware of the security threats to their resources. No matter how strict the security policies and mechanisms are, more organizations are becoming susceptible to a wide range of security breaches against their electronic resources. Network-intrusion detection is an essential defense mechanism against security threats, which have been increasing in rate lately. It is defined as a special form of cyber threat analysis to identify malicious actions that could affect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information resources. Data mining-based intrusion-detection mechanisms are extremely useful in discovering security breaches. This article will provide an overview of the applications of data mining techniques in the information security domain. The focus will be on applying data mining to intrusion detection and intrusion prevention.

To evade detection, malware has also been encrypted or obfuscated to produce variants that continue to plague properly defended and patched networks with zero day exploits. With malware and malware authors using obfuscation techniques to generate automated polymorphic and metamorphic versions, anti-virus software must always keep up with their samples and create a signature that can recognize the new variants. Creating a signature for each variant in a timely fashion is a problem that anti-virus companies face all the time. In this paper we present detection algorithms that can help the anti-virus community to ensure a variant of a known malware can still be detected without the need of creating a signature; a similarity analysis (based on specific quantitative measures) is performed to produce a matrix of similarity scores that can be utilized to determine the likelihood that a piece of code under inspection contains a particular malware. Two general malware detection methods presented in this paper are: Static Analyzer for Vicious Executables (SAVE) and Malware Examiner using Disassembled Code (MEDiC). MEDiC uses assembly calls for analysis and SAVE uses API calls (Static API call sequence and Static API call set) for analysis. We show where Assembly can be superior to API calls in that it allows a more detailed comparison of executables. API calls, on the other hand, can be superior to Assembly for its speed and its smaller signature. Our two proposed techniques are implemented in SAVE) and MEDiC. We present experimental results that indicate that both of our proposed techniques can provide a better detection performance against obfuscated malware. We also found a few false positives, such as those programs that use network functions (e. g. PuTTY) and encrypted programs (no API calls or assembly functions are found in the source code) when the thresholds are set 50% similarity measure. However, these false positives can be minimized, for example by changing the threshold value to 70% that determines whether a program falls in the malicious category or not. © 2010 Springer-Verlag France.","","Cryptography; Security of data; Anti virus; Antivirus softwares; API calls; Assembly functions; Detection algorithm; Detection performance; Executables; False positive; Information assurance; Malicious codes; Malware detection; Malwares; matrix; Metamorphic versions; Network functions; Quantitative measures; Similarity analysis; Similarity measure; Similarity scores; Source codes; Static analyzers; Computer viruses"

With numerous legacy control system installations already in place, current approaches for highly detailed simulations demand a significant modeling effort to be useful. Furthermore, the complexity and lack of technical uniformity in legacy SCADA systems often obscures their core operational semantics, making regulatory compliance monitoring only available to personnel with intimate knowledge about the system. To address these issues, the SCADASiM framework includes two parts. First, it allows rapid recreation of message-based interactions between cyber and physical entities. The resulting simulation is geared towards facilitating the development of strategic and near-real-time security related regulatory compliance monitoring capabilities for critical infrastructure owners. Second, it includes new language utilities for collecting and monitoring the system events necessary to demonstrate regulatory compliance in real-time. In an integrated framework, the simulation facilitates policy authoring using the new language utilities, which in turn allow the observance of policy violation with its operational impact using ""what-if"" scenarios about coordinated attacks on the infrastructure. The two parts of the framework are synchronized by a SCADA taxonomy described using semantic web representation standards. The abstract layers of our taxonomy map to regulatory requirements that mandate security controls in the critical infrastructure, while the lower layers map to actual system components and their events that characterize actual system behavior. Here we describe the design decisions and structure of the SCADASiM framework as well as its initial feasibility using an in-lab control system simulation that replicates a water supply system. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Compliance; Regulations; SCADA simulation","Computer programming languages; Computer simulation languages; Control theory; Critical infrastructures; Integration; Legacy systems; Public works; SCADA systems; Security of data; Semantic Web; Semantics; Taxonomies; Water supply; Water supply systems; Actual system; Compliance; Compliance monitoring; Control system simulations; Coordinated attack; Cyber security; Design decisions; Integrated frameworks; Legacy control systems; Near-real time; Operational impacts; Operational semantics; Regulations; Regulatory requirements; SCADA simulation; Security controls; Regulatory compliance"

An Introduction to Practical Formal Methods Using Temporal Logic provides an introduction to formal methods based on temporal logic, for developing and testing complex computational systems. These methods are supported by many well-developed tools, techniques and results that can be applied to a wide range of systems. Fisher begins with a full introduction to the subject, covering the basics of temporal logic and using a variety of examples, exercises and pointers to more advanced work to help clarify and illustrate the topics discussed. He goes on to describe how this logic can be used to specify a variety of computational systems, looking at issues of linking specifications, concurrency, communication and composition ability. He then analyses temporal specification techniques such as deductive verification, algorithmic verification, and direct execution to develop and verify computational systems. The final chapter on case studies analyses the potential problems that can occur in a range of engineering applications in the areas of robotics, railway signalling, hardware design, ubiquitous computing, intelligent agents, and information security, and explains how temporal logic can improve their accuracy and reliability. Models temporal notions and uses them to analyze computational systems.

Although there are no known reported incidents of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure as acts of terror, this could potentially become a tactic in the future. There are several methods for countering terrorist and insurgent information operations on the Internet. The federal government has organizations that conduct strategic communications, counterpropaganda, and public diplomacy activities. The National Framework for Strategic Communication guides how interagency components are to integrate their activities. However, these organizations may be stovepiped within agencies, and competing agendas may be at stake. This report does not discuss technical and Internet architecture design solutions. Some may interpret the law to prevent federal agencies from conducting ""propaganda"" activities that may potentially reach domestic audiences. Others may wish to dismantle all websites that are seen to have malicious content or to facilitate acts of terror, while some may have a competing interest in keeping a site running and monitoring it for intelligence value. Key issues for Congress: • Although the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative addresses a federal cybersecurity strategy and departmental roles and responsibilities, overclassification, competing equities, and poor information sharing between agencies hinder implementation of a national cybersecurity strategy. (See ""Federal Government Efforts to Address Cyberterrorism."") • Federal agencies have interpreted the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 USC. § 1461), also known as the Smith-Mundt Act,as creating a ""firewall"" between foreign and domestic audiences, limiting US government counterpropaganda activities on the Internet. (See ""Institutional Constraints."") • Some agencies favor monitoring and surveillance of potentially harmful websites, while others would shut them down entirely. (See ""Intelligence Gain/Loss Calculus."") • Different agency approaches to combating terrorists' use of the Internet and different definitions and strategies for activities such as information operations (IO) and strategic communications (SC) create an oversight challenge for Congress. (See ""Counterpropaganda: Strategic Communications, Public Diplomacy, and Information Operations."") Cybersecurity proposals from the 111th Congress such as S. 3480, which contained controversial provisions labeled by the media as the Internet ""Kill Switch,"" are likely to be reintroduced in some form in the 112th Congress.

A major threat is information leakage from database access patterns generated by query executions. The standard private information retrieval (PIR) schemes, which are widely regarded as theoretical solutions, entail ${O}(n)$ computational overhead per query for a database with $n$ items. Recent works propose to protect access patterns by introducing a trusted component with constant storage size. The resulting privacy assurance is as strong as PIR, though with $O(1)$ online computation cost, they still have ${O}(n)$ amortized cost per query due to periodically full database shuffles. In this paper, we design a novel scheme in the same model with provable security, which only shuffles a portion of the database. The amortized server computational complexity is reduced to ${O}(\sqrt{n\log n/k})$. With a secure storage storing thousands of items, our scheme can protect the access pattern privacy of databases of billions of entries, at a lower cost than those using ORAM-based poly-logarithm algorithms. © 2010 IEEE.","data privacy; Database; information security","Algebra; Computational complexity; Data privacy; Information retrieval; Access patterns; Computational overheads; Constant storage size; Database; Database access; Information leakage; information security; Logarithm algorithm; Lower cost; Online computations; Privacy assurance; Privacy protection; Private information retrieval; Provable security; Query execution; Secure storage; Security requirements; Theoretical solutions; Trusted components; Database systems"

By integrating IS experts' judgments, we constructed a quantitative Bayesian index model for the assessment of enterprises' IS risk. The risk assessment of enterprises' IS makes enterprises aware of their IS risk and enables them to make better decisions to reduce that risk. Through the Delphi method and in-depth interviews with domain experts, the risk factors of IS were grouped into five categories with a total of 29 risk items. The first five key indicators are as follows: (i) top management support; (ii) the impediment and detection of the attack by worms, viruses and spyware programs; (iii) the protective measure and technique against the known hacker's attack; (iv) system access privilege control password, gold key management and (v) the IS equipment/software meets the requirement. Finally, the model was cross validated with enterprises that have implemented International Organization for Standardization/International Electro-technical Commission 27001. The study demonstrated that a subjective Bayesian model can be used to develop a reliable index for measuring IS risk, with potential for practical application in the management of the IS risk. © The Author 2011.

This paper argues that these methodologies have a traditional orientation towards the identification and assessment of technical information assets. This obscures key risks associated with the cultivation and deployment of organisational knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to explore how security risk assessment methods can more effectively identify and treat the knowledge associated with business processes. Design/methodology/approach: The argument was developed through an illustrative case study in which a well-documented traditional methodology is applied to a complex data backup process. Follow-up interviews were conducted with the organisation's security managers to explore the results of the assessment and the nature of knowledge ""assets"" within a business process. Findings: It was discovered that the backup process depended, in subtle and often informal ways, on tacit knowledge to sustain operational complexity, handle exceptions and make frequent interventions. Although typical information security methodologies identify people as critical assets, this study suggests a new approach might draw on more detailed accounts of individual knowledge, collective knowledge and their relationship to organisational processes. Originality/value: Drawing on the knowledge management literature, the paper suggests mechanisms to incorporate these knowledge-based considerations into the scope of information security risk methodologies. A knowledge protection model is presented as a result of this research. This model outlines ways in which organisations can effectively identify and treat risks around process knowledge critical to the business. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Data security; Information systems; Risk assessment; Risk management",""

Based on a sample of 101 investment announcements of firms whose stocks are publicly traded in the U.S. stock market between 1997 and 2006, we find substantial support for the hypotheses that information security investment leads to positive abnormal returns for firms.

The computer systems of these users are weak-controlled and are outside of sphere of well-defined information security protection decisions. The technologies for data protection in case of theft or loss of computers and data devices and in case of data leakage are very important for eGovernment services users and must have appropriate properties to be useful for their security needs. A model of anti-theft technology implementation, which disables stolen computers and can send them data-destructive commands to erase sensitive data, is presented. The technologies for control over the channels which can lead to data leakage protect data by whitelisting or blacklisting some devices or ports, by prohibit and allow some actions and operations, or by transparent encryption of outbound data. Some technologies for control over the leaving data use pre-defined set of sensitive data type definitions.

The introduction of the full paper discusses what we believe to be the shortcomings of a number of papers in the open literature about real-time scheduling algorithms and then, in its last paragraph, proposes what we believe to be a new and better DTSA, which is explained in sections 1 and 2. Section 1 gives a dependable scheduling model which considers both reliability and security and is suitable for the distributed real-time system that has high requirements for dependability. Section 2 proposes our improved DTSA which combines fault-tolerant technology with information security technology; it uses the improved backup copy technology to effectively assign and schedule real-time tasks among many processors, thus enhancing the utilization of CPU resources. It also supports to handle hardware failure and software failure. Specially, it prevents these malice tasks from running on processor by checking its identify before running. Section 3 simulates our DTSA; the simulation results, presented in Figs. 1, and their analysis show preliminarily that, compared with other algorithms, our DSTA can obtain higher performance with little cost in hardware, thus having better dependability.","Algorithms; Assurance task model; Dependable task scheduling algorithm (DTSA); Real time systems; Scheduling; Security of data","Interactive computer systems; Multitasking; Real time systems; Security of data; Assurance task model; CPU resources; Distributed real time system; Fault-tolerant; Hardware failures; Information security technologies; Other algorithms; Real-time scheduling algorithms; Real-time tasks; Scheduling models; Simulation result; Software failure; Task-scheduling algorithms; Scheduling algorithms"

To explain and verify the proposed methodology, the substation automation systems are selected as a typical application field.

The use of a mobile agent, in particular, is an important breakthrough on the e-commerce applications. With the abilities of higher autonomy and mobility, a mobile agent can move freely among different execution environments, can automatically detect its resided environment, and can react itself accordingly. Besides, a mobile agent itself can complete the tasks assigned by the users. Because of these characteristics, a mobile agent becomes the most suitable application for e-commerce. However, it is always a risk to transfer confidential information over an open Internet environment. When a mobile agent roams itself among the servers over Internet or the mobile agents exchange information with each other, the users would concern whether the mobile agent was attacked by some manipulated servers or the carried confidential information is stolen or tampered by the others. All these worries make the safety of a mobile agent on the Internet be an important issue. Thus, this paper will propose a suitable and secure scheme for the mobile agent. The scheme, based on the bilinear pairing over elliptic curves, takes the concept of identity-based access control on a hierarchical key management. This paper also aims to increase improvements on the scheme presented by Volker and Mehrdad to resolve the problem of storage waste in their scheme because of storing the overlapping decryption keys of a mobile agent. From the results of the security and performance analysis in this paper, the proposed scheme is proven to protect the mobile agent in an efficient and secure way. © 2011 ICIC International.","Access control; Bilinear pairings; Information security; Key management; Mobile agent","Access control; Autonomous agents; Computer crime; Electronic commerce; Internet; Security systems; Bilinear pairing; Bilinear pairings; Confidential information; Decryption keys; E-Commerce; E-Commerce applications; Elliptic curve; Execution environments; Hierarchical key management; ID-based; Identity-based; Information security; Internet environment; Key management; Security and performance; Mobile agents"

However, the security of the fingerprint data is particularly important as the possible compromise of the data will be permanent. In order to protect the fingerprint data, the fuzzy vault scheme has emerged as a promising solution to the user privacy problem. The techniques, such as ""fuzzy vault,"" which is based on the difficulty of the polynomial reconstruction need to be developed for the smartcard-based environment. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient approach, which reconstructs a polynomial on a smartcard with the aid of a server by using fuzzy fingerprint vaults distributed into the smartcard and the server. The goal of our approach is, under the real-time constraint, to enhance the security level of the fuzzy vault scheme against not only the typical brute-force attack, but recently reported correlation attack which finds the real minutiae using multiple fuzzy vaults enrolled for different applications. Based on the experimental results, we confirmed that our secret distribution-based approach can perform the fuzzy vault-based fingerprint verification more securely (by a factor of 177 in brute-force attack, and by a factor of 10 9 in correlation attack) and quickly (by a factor of 17) on a combination of a smartcard and a server.","Correlation attack; Fuzzy vault; Information security; Secret distribution","Security of data; Authentication systems; Brute-force attack; Card holder verifications; Correlation attack; Fingerprint verification; Fuzzy vault; Fuzzy vault scheme; Polynomial reconstruction; Real time constraints; Secret distribution; Security level; User privacy; Smart cards"

Design/methodology/approach – A Bayesian network (BN) is created and analyzed over the relationship between mistakes and causes. The BN is created by eliciting qualitative and quantitative data from experts of industrial control system deployments in the critical infrastructure domain. Findings – The data collected in this study show that domain experts have a shared perception of how strong the influence of human and organizational factors are. According to domain experts, this influence is strong. This study also finds that security flaws are common in industrial control systems operating critical infrastructure. Research limitations/implications – The model presented in this study is created with the help of a number of domain experts. While they agree on qualitative structure and quantitative parameters, future work should assure that their opinion is generally accurate. Practical implications – The influence of a set of important variables related to organizational/human aspects on information security flaws is presented. Social implications The context of this study is deployments of systems that operate nations' critical infrastructure. The findings suggest that initiatives to secure such infrastructures should not be purely technical. Originality/value – Previous studies have focused on either the causes of security flaws or the actual flaws that can exist in installed information systems. However, little research has been spent on the relationship between them.

Perhaps most prominent was Wikileaks.org's unauthorized publication of more than 600,000 classified Department of Defense documents. Such incidents have further heightened congressional, media, and public interest in classified information policy. President Barack H. Obama issued Executive Order 13526 on ""Classified National Security Information"" on December 29, 2009, and Congress enacted P.L. 111-258, the Reducing Over- Classification Act, which President Obama signed into law on October 9, 2010. This report provides information on classified information policy, which also is called security classification policy and national security classification information policy. It discusses the history, costs, and agencies assigned roles in classified information policy. The report focuses on Executive Order 13526, which establishes much of the current policy, and the report identifies possible oversight issues for Congress. In broad terms, classified information policy aims to decrease the probability of persons or foreign nations accessing government-held information without authorization and using it to harm the national security of the United States. To this end, many authorities and policies limit access to information held by the federal government. Federal law defines ""classified information"" as ""information or material designated and clearly marked or clearly represented, pursuant to the provisions of a statute or Executive order (or a regulation or order issued pursuant to a statute or Executive order), as requiring a specific degree of protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national security (50 U.S.C. 426(1))."" According to the Information Security Oversight Office, government security classification costs were $8.8 billion in FY2009, although this figure excludes intelligence agencies' expenditures. Congress has enacted statutes to set aspects of classified information policy. More regularly, Presidents have issued executive orders to establish classified information policies and procedures. Typically, these directives have defined (1) who in the federal government may classify information; (2) what levels of classification and classification markings (e.g., ""top secret"") may be used; (3) who may access classified information; and (4) how and when classified information is to be declassified. E.O. 13526 revised the previous policies on these matters and established a National Declassification Center. This center, located at the National Archives and Records Administration, is tasked with eliminating a more than 400 million-page backlog of classified records that are 25 years old and older. Congress may opt to examine the implementation of E.O. 13526, including issues such as its mandate for agencies to review their security classification guides for fealty to current policy. Additionally, the practice of permitting the executive branch to set much of classified information policy may be subject to examination. Similarly, the enactment of the Reducing Over- Classification Act came less than a year after the issuance of E.O. 13526. Congress may choose to examine to what degree classifying agencies have implemented the new law and the executive order consonantly. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

At present, the main methods to estimate the density of the vulnerabilities focus on the macro level, but they can not reflect the essential of vulnerability. A prediction model based on micro-parameter is proposed to predict the number of vulnerability with the micro-parameters of software, and it extracts the typical micro-parameters from some software series for the purpose of discovering the relationship between the vulnerability number and micro-parameters. With the hypothesis of vulnerability inheriting, the prediction model abstracts the micro-parameters from software and tries to find a linear relationship between the vulnerability number and some micro-parameters. This model also gives a method to predict the vulnerability number of software with its micro-parameters and the vulnerability number of its previous versions. This method is verified with 7 software series, and the results show the prediction model is effective.","History vulnerability; Inherited vulnerability; Microscopic parameters; Software analysis; Vulnerability predicts","Mathematical models; Security of data; Inherited vulnerability; Linear relationships; Microscopic parameters; Prediction model; Software analysis; Software vulnerabilities; Vulnerability analysis; Vulnerability predicts; Forecasting"

This paper seeks to consider the global adoption of the ISO27000 series of standards, and to compare them with the adoption rates for ISO9000 and ISO14000. The paper aims to compare the barriers to adoption for the different standards. Previous studies suggest that ISO27001 adoption is slower than for the other standards. The uptake of ISO27001 has been slower than the related management system standards ISO9001 and ISO14001, with approximately half the certifications compared with ISO14001. In response to the issues raised in this analysis, the paper considers how an approach based on a maturity model can be used to help overcome these barriers, especially in smaller companies. The 2008 survey of ISO27001-certificated companies found that 50 per cent of the certificated organisations which responded had fewer than 200 employees, and were therefore in the SME category. Perhaps more surprisingly, around half of these had fewer than 50 employees The framework has used the ISO27002 code of practice to define the elements, which should be considered within the ISMS. Each element is then developed through a maturity model lifecycle to develop processes to the point where an ISO27001-compliant ISMS can be implemented. The principal contribution of the paper is a step-by-step framework designed to simplify the process for organisations working towards ISO27001 and offer significant benefits at milestones before systems are mature enough to achieve certification. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Incremental approach; Information security; ISO 9000 series; ISO14000; ISO27001; Total quality management","Industrial management; Security of data; Standards; Total quality management; Barriers to adoption; Code of practice; Design/methodology/approach; Incremental approach; Information security management systems; ISO 14001; ISO 9000 series; ISO 9001; ISO-9000; ISO14000; ISO27001; Management systems; Maturity model; Quality of information; Step-by-step; Information management"

However, we find that the PSI technique provides an attractive method to record the ciphertext, but contributes little to the security level of the cryptosystem. From the cryptanalysis point of view, in a certain simplified case, an attacker is only required to crack two equivalent decryption keys instead of the original random phase keys and geometric key. Moreover, a chosen-plaintext attack method is proposed, in which an impulse function is chosen as a known plaintext. By using this attack, the attacker can effectively recover any plaintext from the corresponding ciphertext. The validity of the attack is verified by computer simulations. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","chosen-plaintext attack; optical cryptanalysis; optical information security; phase-shifting interferometry","Computer simulation; Cryptography; Interferometry; Chosen-plaintext attack; Ciphertexts; Cryptographic schemes; Decryption keys; Impulse function; optical cryptanalysis; Optical information security; Phase shifting Interferometry; Plaintext; Random phase keys; Security level; Security of data"

A new algorithm of modular exponentiation is proposed based on Fast Fourier Transform. This new algorithm makes the best of previous computing result, reduces lots of repeated computation, and so gives higher efficiency. Another significance of the algorithm is that it can be parallel implemented, and then its efficiency can be greatly improved again.

In MBNS steganography, secret data are converted into symbols in a notational system with multiple bases. The pixels of a host image are then altered such that their remainders are equal to the symbols, when the pixel values are divided by the bases. Empirically it is observed that the moments of the entropy measure of the remainders in a stego image are larger than that of its clean counterpart. Based on this observation, we propose an active steganalytic approach which effectively breaks the MBNS steganography even with 5% payload capacity, utilizing these moments as features and also makes an estimation of the embedding rate.

The main idea is that the transmitter estimates channel information from a training sequence transmitted by the mobile terminal and randomly selects several antennas for fast switching transmission. Weighting coefficients of each antenna are calculated according to channel information and the spread-spectrum sequence. Therefore, the signal is a space-spreadspectrum signal associated with the spread-spectrum sequence and the channel information of each antenna. In this way, the desired receiver with a single antenna can demodulate the received signal as traditional spreadspectrum signals, while eavesdroppers cannot extract any useful information from the received signal even if eavesdroppers know the spread-spectrum sequence of the transmit signal because of the fast switching of the transmit antenna. Simulation results show that the signal has the same ability of anti-eavesdropping, and has anti-jamming capability with low probability of detection compared to a reference method.","Low probability of interception; Physical layer; Secure communication; Switched antenna array","Antenna arrays; Probability; Receiving antennas; Security of data; Security systems; Signal receivers; Spread spectrum communication; Anti-jamming capability; Channel information; Fast switching; Low probability of detections; Low probability of interceptions; Mobile terminal; Physical layer security; Physical layers; Received signals; Reference method; Secure communications; Simulation result; Single antenna; Spread spectra; Spread-spectrum signals; Switched antenna; Training sequences; Transmit antenna; Weighting coefficient; Mobile antennas"

Using this method, message bits are embedded into uncertain and higher LSB layers, resulting in increased imperceptible and robustness of stego-image.

However, detection-based techniques might be effective in collaboration with prevention-based techniques for securing WSNs. As a significant branch of detection-based techniques, the research of anomaly detection in wired networks and wireless ad hoc networks is already quite mature, but such solutions can be rarely applied to WSNs without any change, because WSNs are characterized by constrained resources, such as limited energy, weak computation capability, poor memory, short communication range, etc. The development of anomaly detection techniques suitable for WSNs is therefore regarded as an essential research area, which will enable WSNs to be much more secure and reliable. In this survey paper, a few of the key design principles relating to the development of anomaly detection techniques in WSNs are discussed in particular. Then, the state-of-the-art techniques of anomaly detection in WSNs are systematically introduced, according to WSNs architectures (Hierarchical/Flat) and detection technique categories (statistical techniques, rule based, data mining, computational intelligence, game theory, graph based, and hybrid, etc.). The analyses and comparisons of the approaches that belong to a similar technique category are represented technically, followed by a brief discussion towards the potential research areas in the near future and conclusion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The I component is transformed by double random-phase encoding based on FrFT using the H component and the new random phase as two phase plates. Then chaos scrambling technology is used to encrypt the image, which makes the resulting image nonlinear and disorder both in spatial domain and frequency domain.

Each type of data has its own unique features; therefore different data requires a different type of encryption algorithm. Most of the present day techniques are suitable for textual data and they are not suitable for multi- media content rich data such as images. Combined with nonlinear dynamic (chaotic) maps, a new algorithm is developed and applied to image based cryptosystems. In this proposed algorithm, we propose a pixel shuffling, base 64 encoding based algorithm, which is a combination of block permutation, pixel permutation and value transformation. In general, diffusion and permutation is performed in an iterative fashion. These two methods are opened and operated alternatively in every round of encryption process; at least four such chaotic sub keys are employed in every round of primitive encryption process. Decryption has the same structure, which operates in reverse order. The statistical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm has good immunity to various attacks and it is suitable for various software and hardware applications. A new approach is proposed to generate a random-bit sequence with a high degree of randomness. The proposed algorithm is a better alternative to satisfy the need for information security services. The performance analysis of the proposed new approach is tested for randomness by carrying out various testing rules and statistical test. Results of the various types of analysis are encouraging and imply that the proposed approach is very successfully able to adeptly trade offs between the speed and protection. Hence it is suitable for the real-time transmission of image and wireless communication applications.","Base 64 encoding; Chaotic maps; Image encryption; Logistic map and block cipher","Algorithms; Chaotic systems; Encoding (symbols); Internet; Pixels; Random processes; Security of data; Statistical tests; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Base 64 encoding; Block ciphers; Chaotic map; Degree of randomness; Encryption algorithms; Image encryption; Image encryption algorithm; Image encryptions; Image-based; Iterative fashion; Logistic map and block cipher; Media content; Non-linear dynamics; Performance analysis; Real-time transmissions; Reverse order; Secure transmission; Sub-keys; Textual data; Trade off; Unique features; Various attacks; Wireless communications; Cryptography"

The need for container security is evidenced by the Container Security Initiative launched by the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP). One method of monitoring cargo containers is using low power wireless sensor tags. The wireless sensor tags are used to set up a network that is comprised of tags internal to the container and a central device. The sensor network reports alarms and other anomalies to a central device, which then relays the message to an outside network upon arrival at the destination port. This allows the port authorities to have knowledge of potential security or integrity issues before physically examining the container. Challenges of using wireless sensor tag networks for container security include battery life, size, environmental conditions, information security, and cost among others. PNNL developed an active wireless sensor tag platform capable of reporting data wirelessly to a central node as well as logging data to nonvolatile memory. The tags, operate at 2.4 GHz over an IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, and were designed to be distributed throughout the inside of a shipping container in the upper support frame. The tags are mounted in a housing that allows for simple and efficient installation or removal prior to, during, or after shipment. The distributed tags monitor the entire container volume. The sensor tag platform utilizes low power electronics and provides an extensible sensor interface for incorporating a wide range of sensors including chemical, biological, and environmental sensors. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Container security; wireless sensor tags","Aerospace engineering; Characterization; Composite materials; Containers; Freight transportation; Laws and legislation; Power electronics; Security of data; Security systems; Sensors; Ships; Standards; Supply chains; Battery life; Bureau of customs and border protections; Cargo containers; Container security initiatives; Environmental conditions; Environmental sensor; Global supply chain; IEEE 802.15.4; Information security; Logging data; Low power wireless; Non-volatile memories; Port authorities; Sensor interface; Sensor tag; Shipping containers; Wireless sensor; wireless sensor tags; Wireless sensor networks"

The method consists of; firstly, the analytic hierarchy structure of the risk assessment is constructed and the method of PSO comprehensive judgment is improved according to the actual condition of the information security. Secondly, the risk degree put forward is PSO estimation of the risk probability, the risk impact severity and risk uncontrollability. Finally, it gives examples to prove that this method Multi Objectives Programming Methodology (MOPM) can be well applied to security risk assessment and provides reasonable data for constituting the risk control strategy of the information systems security. Based on the risk assessment results, the targeted safety measures are taken, and the risk is transferred and reduced, which is controlled within an acceptable range.","Analytic hierarchy process; Information security; Multi-objectives model; PSO; Risk assessment",""

Cyberterrorism is the exploitation of computer network tools to incur malfunction or shut down critical infrastructures with several keyboard punches, which is dramatically different from traditional terrorism. Due to the ubiquitous multimedia communication tools, they have radically transformed the ways concerning data transmission. Unfortunately, it also incurs unprecedented opportunities for committing cyber crimes that we were not able to foresee two decades ago. Undoubtedly, the mushrooming proliferation of mobile phones spectacularly triggers the information security leakage while most people heavily rely on mobile phones for daily communication.

It makes available a very easy-to-deploy environment, which once installed, is ready to be used. These two characteristics, make it a very attractive choice. But regarding information security and privacy, it presents several and important drawbacks. This is mainly due to the fact that it leaves the most serious tasks, like server configuration or access control in the hands of the system administrator or third-party module developers. This approach is understandable, as is that very fact what makes Moodle easy and therefore attractive. The aim of this paper is not to discredit this option, but to enhance it by means of standard cryptographic and information security infrastructures.

In this technique one can secure any type of files using Fibonacci series. The proposed encryption/decryption algorithm is loss-less, key-dependent. The performance of the popular symmetric key algorithms including DES, 3DES, AES, Blowfish, are compared with Fibonacci Series encryption/decryption by encrypting input files of varying contents and sizes.

It has been emphasized by BS 25999 standard that an organization must have a Business Continuity (BC) program in place to fulfill its obligations in this world of uncertainty. The main objectives are that in all unusual situations the business should sustain, maintain regulatory compliances and deliver its products and services with minimum losses to its employees, customers, vendors, and to the society at large. This paper illustrates the concept of BCP along with its implication to business in adverse circumstances and enunciates a methodology about how a Business Continuity Planning framework can be established in an organization. © 2011 IEEE.","BS 25999 standard; Business Continuity (BC); Business Continuity Management (BCM); Business Continuity Planning (BCP); Information Security","BS 25999 standard; Business Continuity (BC); Business continuity management; Business Continuity Planning (BCP); Information Security; Security of data"

Remote authentication is the most commonly used method to determine the identity of a remote client. This paper investigates a systematic approach for authenticating clients by three factors, namely password, smart card, and biometrics. A generic and secure framework is proposed to upgrade two-factor authentication to three-factor authentication. The conversion not only significantly improves the information assurance at low cost but also protects client privacy in distributed systems. In addition, our framework retains several practice-friendly properties of the underlying two-factor authentication, which we believe is of independent interest. © 2006 IEEE.","Authentication; biometrics; distributed systems; password; privacy; security; smart card","Authentication; Biometrics; Smart cards; Client privacy; Distributed systems; Generic frameworks; Information assurance; Low costs; password; Remote authentication; Remote clients; security; Security and privacy; Two factor authentication; Network security"

Due to uncertainty, the financial impact of threats attacking assets is often difficult to measure quantitatively, and thus it is difficult to prescribe which countermeasures to employ. In this research, we describe a decision support system for calculating the uncertain risk faced by an organization under cyber attack as a function of uncertain threat rates, countermeasure costs, and impacts on its assets. The system uses a genetic algorithm to search for the best combination of countermeasures, allowing the user to determine the preferred tradeoff between the cost of the portfolio and resulting risk.

Relative research shows that trusted platform module (TPM) plays a crucial role in efficiently enhancing the security of information system. However, existing TPM is designed for PCs, and thus cannot satisfy the specific application needs of embedded systems. Addressing this issue, we analyze the challenges in the research of TPM posed by the embedded system environment, and propose a novel embedded trusted platform module (ETPM) that can adapt to such environment. As important components in ETPM, bus arbitration improves the platform's control ability and increases the security of embedded system; symmetric cryptography engine accelerates the speed of symmetric encryption and decryption; and system backup-recovery enhances the reliability of the embedded system. Furthermore, ETPM supports star style measurement module in embedded system environment. ETPM has been tested in trusted PDA, and experiment results show that ETPM is practical, efficient, reliable and secure.","Embedded system; Embedded trusted platform module; Information security; Trusted computing; Trusted platform module","Cryptography; Security of data; Thermoelectric power; Bus arbitration; Symmetric cryptography; Symmetric encryption; System environment; Trusted computing; Trusted platform module; Embedded systems"

Design/methodology/approach - The framework assumes that the organization is aware of a set of remedies that can be employed to address end-effects that have been identified. The framework also assumes that the organization defines its information security policy by setting a minimum level of protection for each end-effect. Given the two sets of costs, that of the end-effect and the potential damage it can cause and that of the remedy and the required level of protection from each end-effect, this framework can be used to identify the optimal set of remedies for a given budget that complies with the organization's information security policy. The framework is illustrated using a practical example concerning investment decision optimization in a financial organization. Findings - The paper shows that exhausting the information security budget does not assure a higher level of security required by the organisation. Practical implications - Concentrating on end-effects and on the organizational requirements eases the process of remedy selection. The proposed methodology circumvents the common process of assuming probabilities of information security events. Originality/value - This research proposes a practical and an easily implementable framework, enabling the information security manager to align the information security remedies and best practice methodological requirements with organizational budget constraints and business requirements while maintaining a required level of security. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

As such, security can be seen as a cost function that leads to the prevention of loss, but not one that can create gains (or profit). With the role of a capital investment to provide a return on investment, security is a defense against unforeseen losses that cost capital and reduce profitability.

The confidential medical information is exposed to the risk of the damage and intercept. Secret sharing scheme is a method of dividing the confidential medical information into two or more tallies. Individual medical information cannot be decoded by using one tally at all. Our method has the function of RAID. With RAID technology, if there is a failure in a single tally, there is redundant data already copied to other tally. Confidential information is preserved at an individual Data Center connected through internet because individual medical information cannot be decoded by using one tally at all. Therefore, even if one of the Data Centers is struck and information is damaged, the confidential medical information can be decoded by using the tallies preserved at the data center to which it escapes damage.

This generalization allows us to compare different systems and to determine the key factors managers need to consider when adopting a new authentication system. The key factors are (1) additional implementation costs, (2) customer switching which is determined by the market share and customers' preferences, and (3) expected losses when the new system fails. This study also suggests that if the provider chooses an expensive new system, the provider needs to have a larger market share to justify the spending. Also, regulators can encourage the adoption of a more secure authentication system by changing the penalty a firm faces when the system fails.

We present two algorithms that calculate the probability of threat and the optimal investment for data center security respectively. Based on the insecurity flow model (Moskowitz and Kang 1997) of analyzing security violations, we first model data center topology using two basic components, namely resources and filters, where resources represent the protected resources and filters represent the security protection devices. Four basic patterns are then identified as the building blocks for the first algorithm, called Accumulative Probability of Insecurity, to calculate the accumulative probability of realized threat (insecurity) on each resource. To calculate the optimal security investment, a risk-neutral based algorithm, called Optimal Security Investment, which maximizes the total expected net benefit is then proposed. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach coincides with Gordon's (Gordon and Loeb, ACM Transactions on Information and Systems Security 5(4):438-457, 2002) single-system analytical model. In addition, numerical results on two common data center topologies are analyzed and compared to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A central question for the project is how information security issues are communicated within organizations, specifically underlining that communication is control in a cybernetic sense. Design/methodology/ approach - The research method applied can be expressed as applied general systems theory combined with design science. The project is carried out in a number of steps: to design modelling techniques and metrics for information security issues in organizations; to collect data from Swedish governmental agencies; to use the modelling techniques to model communication of information security in organizations from different perspectives; to apply metrics on the data in order to assess information security levels in the agencies; to identify gaps; and to identify needs for improvement. Findings - The motivation for the research is that communication of information security issues within organizations tend to be insufficient and the mental connections between IT-security and information security work are weak, which prohibits the organization from learning and adapting in its security work. An entity's authority depends on its ability to control and manage the variety in the 14 layers. The general control objectives needed were implied based on the information security management standard. Originality/value - The paper focuses on mind to mind communication conditions and how to adapt mechanistic systems. Copyright © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Information security professionals regularly monitor network resources and cyber security websites with an interest in understanding how such threats expose their enterprise's vulnerabilities and dependencies. However, information must be persistently and purposefully examined from a multitude of resources in order to establish context and situational awareness. This in turn, enables organizations to perceive, anticipate and counteract threats before they occur and helps assure their ability to accomplish their missions. Global information must be transformed into timely and local actionable knowledge. To achieve this, cyber event data coupled with knowledge of the semantic interrelationships between other location, object, agent, and event entities need to be factored to facilitate a clearer understanding of the total cyber landscape. In this work, we introduce an ontology driven framework comprising of a dynamic knowledge base, a functional and self-updating mission model, and the associated information and complex event processing capabilities.

ICSs can benefit from using IT security technologies, while ICS networks and HMIs are similar to IT systems and are subject to their usual vulnerabilities and threats. Joe Weiss provides a number of general recommendations to protect ICSs from different electronic threats. These recommendations involve developing a clear understanding of ICS cybersecurity, including associated impacts on system reliability and safety for industry, government, and private citizens and changing the culture around critical infrastructure so that security is considered in the same context as performance and safety.","","Accident prevention; Critical infrastructures; Information technology; Losses; Cyber security; Financial loss; Industrial control systems; IT security; IT system; System reliability; Intelligent control"

This paper gives a description of cloud computing followed by a general description of information security issues and solutions, and a brief description of issues linking cloud computing with information security. Security solutions must make a trade-off between the amount of security and its performance cost and impact on the end-user experiences. This is accentuated in a cloud computing environment where users desiring different levels of security share the same resources. An essential issue for cloud computing is the perception of security, which is beyond the simple technical details of security solutions. This paper includes a list of a few key information security challenges that also present significant research opportunities. Solving these key problems will encourage the widespread adoption of cloud computing.","Cloud computing; Information security; Virtualization","Computer systems; Research; Security of data; Computing environments; Cross section; End-user experience; General description; Performance costs; Research activities; Research opportunities; Security research; Security solutions; Technical details; Virtualization; Cloud computing"

The challenges of the current digital information era require experts who are effectively able to counteract piracy, forgery, copyright infringement, and so on. Digital watermarking is one possible technique for fighting piracy, which consists of the insertion of invisible but robust information to protect the data. In this paper, a new teaching approach, designed for testing student skills and progressing in multimedia data protection, is presented. This consists of a distributed security game where students compete by first using the developed watermarking techniques and then attacking each other's methods, thus verifying their robustness. Groups of students from different universities and countries play against each other, trying to compromise other teams' hiding systems while protecting their own data from attacks. The proposed methodology can be considered as an appealing approach for stimulating learning, cooperation, and team competition. The effectiveness of the teaching method is verified by a student survey and their academic results. © 2010 IEEE.","Competitive learning; computer utilization; data hiding; digital watermarking; engineering education","Competition; Computer science; Crime; Curricula; Digital watermarking; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Network security; Personal computers; Students; Teaching; Watermarking; Competitive learning; Copyright infringement; Data hiding; Digital information; Digital information security; Distributed security; Multimedia data; New teaching; Online competition; Student skills; Student surveys; Teaching methods; Watermarking techniques; Wireless access technology; Computer crime"

Reference circuits (e.g., S-BOX, crypto core) were designed in various logic styles, and their robustness against LPA attacks was comparatively evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations in 65 nm. Analysis allowed for better understanding the impact that process variations have on the outcome of LPA attacks, which is an aspect that is not understood currently. Results show that LPA attacks are rather effective also under die-to-die and within-die process variations. Moreover, the comparison between different logic styles showed that standard CMOS logic circuits are extremely vulnerable to LPA attacks. Other logic styles that are robust against traditional Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks were also compared. Interestingly, analysis showed that these logic styles are still vulnerable to LPA attacks. Hence, LPA attacks are an even greater threat to Smart Cards information security, compared to DPA attacks. Moreover, traditional methods to protect Smart Cards against DPA attacks are ineffective in counteracting LPA attacks, thereby showing that a significant research effort will be needed to counteract LPA attacks with suitable solutions that ensure high security standards. © 2011 IEEE.","","Computer simulation; Dies; Electric network analysis; Monte Carlo methods; Security of data; Smart cards; Differential power analysis; DPA attacks; Leakage power analysis; Logic style; Monte Carlo Simulation; Process Variation; Reference circuits; Research efforts; Security standards; Standard CMOS; Suitable solutions; Within-die process; Logic circuits"

Design/methodology/approach – The intervention study had two assessments of knowledge and attitudes among employees: one survey, one week before the intervention, and one survey eight months after the intervention. The population was divided into an intervention group and a control group, where the only separated the groups was participation in the intervention (i.e. the e-learning tool). Findings – The study documents that the effects of the intervention on security awareness and behavior partly remains more than half a year after the intervention, but that the detailed knowledge on information security issues diminished during the period. The study also discusses how such courseware can contribute to long-term organizational learning compared with human interventions such as action research. Both human resource management and internal promotion are necessary input in the process to successfully educate and train employees in information security. Research limitations/implications – One weakness of concern is the low response rate of 37 in the final analysis. Practical implications – The study can document that short-time effects of software supported information security awareness on employees' knowledge, behaviour, and awareness diminish over time. It is thus important to maintain and continually perform information security awareness. More interventions studies, following the same principles as presented in this paper, of other user-directed measures is needed, to test and document the effects of different measures. Originality/value – The paper is innovative in the area of information security research as it shows how an information security intervention can be measured. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Awareness; Behaviour; E-learning; Information security; Intervention study; Organizational learning","E-learning; Human resource management; Knowledge management; Research; Surveys; Action research; Awareness; Behaviour; Control groups; Courseware; Design/methodology/approach; E-learning tool; Human intervention; Information security awareness; Intervention study; Long-term effects; Organizational learning; Research limitations; Response rate; Security awareness; Security of data"

Safety-critical systems, many of which are industrial process control systems, are generally built and tested to much higher standards for handling system failure or aberrant behavior than is typical for even mission-critical information-processing systems. There is a long history of stringent standards for creating, running and sustaining safety-critical systems, particularly avionics, military systems, and the like. For example, international standard DO-178B, which was developed specifically for avionics but has been adopted by other fields, is acknowledged by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as a certification standard for avionics software. Also, NIST's Special Publication 800-82 Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security provides guidance as to securing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control Systems (DCS), and other control system configurations such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). In the U.S. government, the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) defines security objectives for information and information systems according to the traditional triad of confidentiality, integrity and availability. FISMA defines three levels of potential impact low, moderate, high on organizations or individuals were a security breach to occur. Many private-sector organizations do in fact categorize information processing systems according to business criticality. Certain key sectors, such as financial services, are obliged to classify systems as critical in order to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. For key critical operations, systems must incorporate sufficient resiliency so as to mitigate the risk of failure. Usually criticality falls into one of three categories, namely, based on regulatory requirements or guidelines, business continuity, or class of information held, such as nonpublic personal information, and processed within the system. In this paper we examine systems across the full spectrum of criticality, from non-critical, through security-critical and safety-critical systems, in terms of how they are engineered,. That is, we look at the processes by which they are designed, built, deployed, operated, modified and decommissioned. We also discuss how mission-criticality affects the requisite level of assurance. Finally, we describe how some of the demanding methods used to strengthen safety-critical systems, which are expected to exhibit high levels of assurance and integrity, might be adapted to the engineering of security-critical information systems. © 2011 IEEE.","information systems; process control systems; safety-critical; security-critical; software; standards","Accident prevention; Aviation; Avionics; Control theory; Controllers; Criticality (nuclear fission); Data processing; Distributed parameter control systems; Distributed parameter networks; Information systems; Intelligent control; Process control; Programmable logic controllers; SCADA systems; Security of data; Security systems; Standards; Business continuity; Certification standards; Critical operations; DO-178B; European Aviation Safety Agency; Federal Aviation Administration; Financial service; Full spectrum; Handling systems; Industrial control systems; Industrial process control; Information processing systems; Information security managements; International standards; Military systems; Personal information; Potential impacts; Regulatory requirements; Risk of failure; Safety critical systems; safety-critical; Security breaches; Security objectives; security-critical; Stringent standards; System configurations; Information management"

Although the size of multimedia data to be protected is huge, it is difficult to efficiently speed up some cryptography algorithms due to data dependence. In this paper, we propose a general approach which parallelizes cryptographic algorithms having data dependency in order to reduce the execution time for huge data. After analyzing the parallel overhead with AES as an example of cryptographic algorithms having data dependency, we found the barrier synchronization overhead caused by data dependency is the most important one with some multi-core processors. Then, we overlap computations in order to solve the limited parallelism inherent in AES. That is, we interpret the problem as an application-level pipeline and derive the optimum number of pipeline stages by considering the barrier synchronization overhead. © 2011 IEEE.","Barrier synchronization; Information security; Mult-core processor","Cryptography; Information science; Parallel processing systems; Security of data; Synchronization; Barrier synchronization; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptography algorithms; Data dependence; Data dependencies; Execution time; General approach; Limited parallelism; Mult-core processor; Multi-core processor; Multimedia applications; Multimedia data; Optimum number; Parallelizing; Speed-ups; Algorithms"

Today, with the current proliferation of some newly invented methods in cryptanalysis it is obvious that information security is the panacea. In this paper, our strategy used is to apply the encryption methods of the AES and MD5 following some steps in the encryption process in order to produce an outcome of file that will as a result be hashed and strongly decrypted through the robust software for file storing. The most important aspect of our application is the intervention of those elements in the process of the encryption to produce an interwoven hashed result which can escape the tricks of malicious operations by eavesdroppers.

Hash function is a special kind of one-way function which takes a variable-length input and returns a fixed-length value. As one of the cores of Cryptography, hashing is a basic technique widely used in information security. Utilizing chaos to construct hash function is a promising direction which attracts more and more attention. In this chapter, some preliminaries on hash function are firstly given in brief. Then, the systemic descriptions of different chaos-based construction approaches are presented in the order of the simple chaotic map-based hash function, the complex map-based hash function, the composite map-based hash function, the chaotic neural network-based hash function, the parallel hash function as well as the combined chaotic cryptographic and hashing scheme. Meanwhile, the detailed analyses of some typical chaos-based hash functions are described. Finally, by borrowing some principles from classical Cryptography, we summarize some instructions on chaos-based hash function secure construction which is beneficial to the hash function design based on chaos in the future. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","",""

TCG comprised of the international IT giants has published a series of trusted computing specifications to promote the comprehensive development of the trusted computing technology and industry, and the core specifications have been accepted as international standardization by ISO/IEC. In academia, the research institutions at home and abroad study the trusted computing technology in depth and have gained rich achievements. In China, the independent trusted computing standard infrastructure is founded with the core of TCM on the basis of the independent cryptography algorithms, forming the whole trusted computing industry chains, which breaks the monopolization of the trusted computing technology and industry by the international IT giants. With the rapid development of trusted computing field, there are still lots of problems on the key technologies to be solved, and the related research has been done in succession recently. This paper comprehensively illustrates our research results on trusted computing technology. Beginning with establishing the trust of the terminal platforms, we propose a trustworthiness-based trust model and give a method of building trust chain dynamically with information flow, which ensure the real time and security protection of the trust establishment to some extent. Aiming at the security and efficiency problems of the remote attestation protocols, we propose the first property-based attestation scheme on bilinear map and the first direct anonymous attestation scheme based on the q-SDH assumption from the bilinear maps. In trusted computing testing and evaluation, we propose a method of generating test cases automatically with EFSM, and from the method develop a trusted computing platform testing and evaluation system which is the first to be applied in China practically.","Remote attestation; TCM; TPM; Trust chain; Trusted computing; Trusted computing testing and evaluation","Automatic test pattern generation; Industry; Network security; Research; Societies and institutions; Specifications; Remote attestation; TCM; TPM; Trust chain; Trusted computing; Information technology"

Design/methodology/approach - To defend against CIAs this approach involves detecting attacks by using location-specific signatures to validate code statements. The signatures are unique identifiers that represent specific characteristics of a statement's execution. The key property that differentiates the scheme presented in this paper is that these characteristics do not depend entirely on the code statement, but also take into account elements from its execution context. Findings - The approach was applied successfully to defend against attacks targeting structured query language (SQL), XML Path Language and JavaScript with positive results. Originality/value - Despite many countermeasures that have been proposed the number of CIAs has been increasing. Malicious users seem to find new ways to introduce compromised embedded executable code to applications by using a variety of languages and techniques. Hence, a generic approach that defends against such attacks would be a useful countermeasure. This approach can defend attacks that involve both domain-specific languages (e.g. SQL) and general purpose languages (e.g. JavaScript) and can be used both against client-side and server-side attacks. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

It is difficult to keep a network completely safe because cyber attackers can launch attacks through networks without limitations of time and space. As a result, it is an important and critical issue be able to efficiently evaluate network survivability. In this paper, an innovative metric called the Degree of Disconnectivity (DOD) is proposed, which is used to evaluate the damage level of the network. A network attack-defense scenario is also considered in this problem, in which the attack and defense actions are composed by many rounds with each round containing two stages. In the first stage, defenders deploy limited resources on the nodes resulting in attackers needing to increase attack costs to compromise the nodes. In the second stage, the attacker uses his limited budget to launch attacks, trying to maximize the damage of the network. The Lagrangean Relaxation Method is applied to obtain optimal solutions for the problem. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Degree of Disconnectivity; Information System Survivability; Lagrangean Relaxation; Mathematical Programming; Network Attack and Defense; Optimization; Resource Allocation","Industrial engineering; Intelligent systems; Launching; Mathematical programming; Network security; Critical issues; Cyber attackers; Damage level; Disconnectivity; Information System Survivability; Lagrangean Relaxation; Lagrangean relaxation methods; Network Attack and Defense; Network defense; Network survivability; Optimal solutions; Two stage; Computer crime"

The framework uses three kinds of generic ontologies as a solution to this problem - software requirement ontology, application domain ontology, information security ontology. We propose to enhance SRS by associating the ISR with specific entities within ontologies. We aim to facilitate a semantic-based interpretation of ISRs by restricting their interpretation through the three previous ontologies.

The digital content can be further divided into multiple parts, each of which is encapsulated by its own access control policy. This integrated XACML policy and content document is further protected by using XML Encryption (XML-ENC) and XML Signature (XMLDSIG) mechanisms, as well as XML Key Management Specification (XKMS) for leveraging Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), all in support of the embedded and fine-grained structure. This framework and associated security mechanisms are designed primarily to facilitate the protection and sharing of sensitive information in transit and at rest, within and across organizational boundaries.

This requires a systematic and holistic approach that can identify and assess every ""reasonably foreseeable risk"", compare risks on a common basis for prioritization of ""hot spots"", and evaluate the effectiveness of candidate risk mitigation strategies. Designing and implementing a management tool that organizations can utilize for this purpose is challenging, given that it must be comprehensive in nature, yet easy to apply. This paper describes the development of such a tool and its subsequent application to a large marine transportation carrier. In this application, two separate ERM activities were undertaken; one focusing on a functional line of operations throughout the entire organization (information technology and cyber security), and the other involving all activities associated with a specific geographical region that serves as an operations hub. The resulting risk scenarios, assessments and candidate mitigation strategy evaluations are described and discussed. The paper also shares several lessons learned that are important for organizations interested in developing and applying ERM tools. These include how to overcome the challenges of: (1) structuring a framework for identifying enterprise risks and creating corresponding scenarios that are all inclusive, (2) creating an appropriate system for associating the likelihoods and consequences with various risk scenarios, and (3) developing a protocol to enable evaluation of the benefits and costs of potential risk mitigation strategies that are developed in response to those risks that have been deemed to warrant priority attention. Each of these challenges was encountered in the marine transportation carrier study. © 2011 WIT Press.","Cyber information security; Disaster management; Enterprise risk management; Hazard analysis; Marine transport; Risk assessment; Risk identification; Risk mitigation; Scenario analysis","Benchmarking; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Industry; Information technology; Rating; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Security of data; Waterway transportation; Cyber information; Disaster management; Enterprise risk management; Hazard analysis; Marine transport; Risk identification; Risk mitigation; Scenario analysis; benchmarking; disaster management; geographical region; maritime transportation; mitigation; risk assessment; transportation infrastructure; Health risks"

From career criminals to other government agencies outside the U.S., network attacks and intrusions are increasing. Their attacks including the 2009 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks caused massive outages for website of government agencies [1]. Additionally, the 2010 and ongoing WikiLeaks attack led to catastrophic results that threaten U.S. diplomacy [2]. Unfortunately, the United State response has been slow and painstaking. In 2009, our nation faced a massive DDoS attack that caused many government websites that include White House, Department of Defense, Homeland Security, and the Federal Aviation Administrators to lose service. Approximately 60,000 infected computers were used to launch the attacks [3]. In addition, the 2009 DDoS attacks also targeted commerce and news media sites [4]. In response to these attacks, the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security have increased their methods and resources to help secure our nation's infrastructure. This research will ask, if this is enough to secure the nation, and what other new technologies can these agencies employ to thwart the attacks? As much as our government is facing countless attacks, corporations and businesses have also faced attacks. Attacks including the2007 TJX Security Breach resulted in millions of credit card numbers and other confidential consumer information to be compromised [5]. In 2009, the Heartland Payment Systems followed resulting in 100 million credit cards being compromised [6]. Both cases, information was captured by hackers; it was distributed to illegal so called dump sites and trading forums in which confidential data ranging from PIN to social security numbers are traded online and distributed worldwide[7]. What new technologies can the corporate sector explore to secure consumers' information? Consumers' privacy has also been an issue for Information Security. In the United States, privacy laws have favored the corporate interest. Consumers' information is constantly distributed to other third party members without acknowledgement. In contrast, European laws have favored the individual by enforcing strict privacy laws that prevents the corporate sector to distribute information without acknowledgment [8]. This research will determine if these tough privacy laws better protect consumers' information from security breaches. If so, can they implement them here in the United States? As the number of attacks and security breaches continue to rise, we must act now to the growing demands of security. Our nation and its economy rely heavily on our information infrastructure; we must build the defenses that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability within our nation and its infrastructure. © 2011 IEEE.","cyber-attacks; DDoS; DoS; information security; malware; vulnerabilities","Crime; Data privacy; Network security; Personal computing; Security systems; Technology; Websites; Confidential data; Consumer information; Corporate sector; Credit cards; Cyber-attacks; DDoS; DDoS Attack; Department of Defense; Department of Homeland Security; Distributed denial of service attack; European laws; Federal aviation administrators; Government agencies; Government IS; Government websites; Growing demand; Home land security; Information infrastructures; Malwares; Network attack; Network infrastructure; News media; Payment systems; Privacy law; Security breaches; Social security numbers; State response; Third parties; vulnerabilities; White House; Computer crime"

The cross-domain network application pattern is formed to access cross-domain resource, which is adapted to industry application and become widely-used network scheme. Therefore, it is necessary to build a loose and scalable dynamic trust federation, which requires the establishment of trust relationship between various entities. Through a study of trust mechanism, this paper divides entity into two parts including inner-domain and inter-domain and presents a two-level trust federation model in a cross-domain environment. And based on this model, this paper realizes the trust establishment and trust management for different security domains. Meanwhile, this paper describes the problem of privacy protection, information security, access control and federation evaluation in the model. The dynamic trust federation model achieves the trust interaction among different entities.

It is the key problem of many important scopes such as network information security, information retrieval and filtration, computational biology, etc. A great number of security problems have arisen with the wide application of pattern matching, especially in network information security systems, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus systems, anti-spam systems, firewall, etc. A method of algorithmic complexity attacks against WuManber which is a classical multi-patterrn algorithm, and the optimal solution of creating the attacking data are presented in this article. Compared with random data and the data from network, the attacking data can greatly reduce the searching speed of WuManber. Experiments on random data sets show that the larger character set, the better attacking performance. And experiments on the data from the network show that the attacking data can reduce WuManber searching speed by more than 50%. It is found that if a small part of the pattern set is known, the attack data can be created. Defensively speaking, it is important that the pattern set must be kept secret. This article also provides some strategies of improving the security of network information security systems. The attacking data can also be used in checking the system security.","Algorithmic complexity attacks; Intrusion detection; Pattern matching; Security of algorithm; WuManber algorithm","Algorithms; Bioinformatics; Character sets; Computational complexity; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Experiments; Filtration; Information retrieval; Intrusion detection; Network security; Parallel processing systems; Pattern matching; Viruses; Algorithmic complexity; Anti-spam systems; Anti-virus systems; Computational biology; Fundamental problem; Intrusion detection and prevention systems; Network information; Optimal solutions; Pattern set; Random data; Searching speed; Security of algorithm; Security problems; System security; WuManber algorithm; Search engines"

This type of attack is well known as a major threat to information security. Effective solutions with low energy and area cost for improved DPA resistance are urgently needed, especially for energy-constrained modern devices that are often in the physical proximity of attackers. This article presents a novel countermeasure against DPA attacks on smart cards and other digital ICs based on FinFETs, an emerging substitute for bulk CMOS at the 22nm technology node and beyond. We exploit the adaptive power management characteristic of FinFETs to generate a high level of noise at critical moments in the execution of a cryptosystem to thwart DPA attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure by developing a simple power model for estimating DPA spikes. We then validate the model by carrying out DPA attacks on an ASIC implementation of the advanced encryption standard system via gate-level simulation. Both modeling and simulation-based experiment indicate that with the proposed countermeasure, even 8,000,000 power acquisitions are not sufficient to reveal the secret key. As opposed to other countermeasures presented in the literature, the proposed hardware design requires less than 1% increase in area and 15% increase in total energy consumption without any extra delay in the critical path. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to other encryption algorithms as well. © 2011 ACM.","Back-gate biasing; Differential power analysis; FinFET; Noise insertion; Power estimation; Side-channel attacks","Computer simulation; Cryptography; Data privacy; Energy utilization; Information management; Smart cards; Back-gate biasing; Differential power Analysis; FinFET; Noise insertion; Power estimations; Side channel attack; Integrated circuits"

This paper outlines an alternative view and approaches medical information security from a health professional's perspective. The Information Security Employee's Evaluation (ISEE) is presented to evaluate and discuss medical information security with health professionals. The ISEE instrument consists of seven dimensions: priority, responsibility, incident handling, functionality, communication, supervision and training and education. The ISEE instrument can be used to better understand health professional's perception, needs and problems when dealing with information security in practice. Following the design science approach, the ISEE instrument was validated within a focus group of security experts and pilot tested as workshops across five hospital departments in two medical centers. Although the ISEE instrument has by no means the comprehensiveness of existing security standards, we do argue that the instrument can provide valuable insights for both practitioners and research communities.","Confidentially; Evaluation and use of healthcare IT; Information security; Integrity and availability","Bioinformatics; Health; Health care; Hospitals; Information science; Instruments; Confidentially; Design science; Evaluation and use of healthcare IT; Focus groups; Health professionals; Integrity and availability; Medical center; Medical information; Research communities; Security experts; Security standards; Training and education; Security of data"

Nowadays, the information systems are so complex that it becomes hard to analyze what is going on these systems and consequently hard to react in real-time and in an adequate way to the potentially- malicious events that may occur. The tool described in this article is especially designed to react in real time to various threats and challenges occurring, this mechanism is distributed and fully automated, no human intervention is required. This tool is composed of two distinct parts: the immune system and its memory. The immune system has agents that collect data on various different entities infrastructure review, analyze and deduce the Security Assurance values of these entities and commits an immune response (reconfiguration, isolation of the compromised parts, etc) upon detection of anomalies or threats. The memory securely logs the information on the events considered as potentially malicious by the immune system and the corresponding immune responses. These logs could be used by the CISO and its staff to perform digital forensics and readapt its security policies. The immune system and the memory are also able to react to and tolerate failures or attacks since they are deployed over a resilient overlay network called ROSA.

The architecture starts with a formal requirement model defining multiple levels of functional capability and information assurance. The architecture includes a multi-layer design to implement the requirements using N-variant techniques. It also integrates a reconfiguration mechanism that uses lower layers to monitor higher layers, and if a fault is detected, it reconfigures a system to maintain essential services. We first provide a general reliability model (based on generalized stochastic Petri nets) for such a system with cross-monitoring for reconfiguration. Next, we define a probabilistic automaton-based model for behavioral modeling of the system. This model is especially suitable for modeling security problems induced by value faults. Whereas the Petri net allows for reliability modeling and reconfiguration, the performance analysis of the system is given via probabilistic model checking. The models are experimentally evaluated and compared. With the current widespread deployment of multi-core processors, one question in software engineering is how to effectively harness the parallel computing power provided by these processors. The architecture presented here allows us to explore the parallel computing power that otherwise may be wasted, and uses it to improve the dependability and survivability of a system, which is validated by our performance analysis. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","","Fault detection; Model checking; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Petri nets; Reliability analysis; Stochastic models; Fault detection; Parallel processing systems; Petri nets; Reliability analysis; Software architecture; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Behavioral modeling; Essential services; Functional capabilities; Generalized Stochastic Petri nets; Information assurance; Multi-core platforms; Multi-core processor; Multilayer designs; Multiple levels; Performance analysis; Probabilistic model checking; Reconfiguration mechanisms; Reliability model; Reliability modeling; Security problems; Functional capabilities; General reliabilities; Generalized Stochastic Petri nets; Information assurance; Multi-core platforms; Probabilistic automata; Probabilistic model checking; Reconfiguration mechanisms; Software architecture; Model checking"

Security process algebra(SPA) is a classic method used in researching information security properties in nondeterministic system. To analyze the information security properties and capture the information leakage in probabilistic and real time system, SPA is extended in probabilistic and time setting. Probabilistic and time security process algebra(ptSPA), an extension of SPA, is proposed by first introducing the probabilistic and time calculus to specify activities constricted by probability and time, and extending the formal syntax and semantic to enhance the SPA. Then, the related notion of probabilistic and time bisimulation equivalence is presented, to describe two observable behavior traces are equivalent when considering probability and time. Based on ptSPA, several information flow security properties in probabilistic and real time system, such as TBSPNI, PTBNDC and SPTBNDC are defined, which can capture probabilistic and time covert channel while the original SPA cannot. The relations among the information flow security properties are analyzed. Finally, a case study is given to show that the expressiveness of calculus in ptSPA is possible to model and analyze probabilistic and time systems.","Covert channel; Information flow analysis; Noninterference; Process algebra; Security properties","Algebra; Calculations; Data flow analysis; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Semantics; Covert channels; Information flow analysis; Noninterference; Process algebras; Security properties; Security of data"

The presented approach is based on model-theoretical formalization of a subject domain ontology. The formal measures of information retrieval effectiveness are studied. The central problem of our consideration is the problem of pertinence of information retrieval. To contribute to the solution of this problem, we present an approach which is called the Virtual Catalog. This approach is a synthesis of search engines and Internet catalogs. The development of the Virtual Catalog is based on subject domain ontologies. Ontologies are formalized in model-theoretical terms. We develop methods of ontology representation as a network of sentences of first-order predicate logic. We use three types of ontology to solve the problem of pertinence of information retrieval: ontology of the subject domain which is relevant to the desired information; ontology of the Internet which describes various types of Internet resources; and ontology of user needs and types of information search tasks. With the help of the subject domain ontology, we specify the user's field of interest. The user needs ontology helps us to specify what kind of information the user wants. The Internet ontology gives the possibility to determine the desired type of Internet resource. Our approach is applied to develop Virtual Catalogs for two fields: mathematics and information security. We present technologies for constructing ontologies for these fields and technologies for fine search organization on the Internet. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","","Data processing; Data reduction; Information retrieval; Internet; Libraries; Problem solving; Search engines; Security of data; Telecommunication networks; Central problems; Domain ontologies; First-order; Information search; Internet resources; Measures of information; Ontology-based; Predicate logic; Retrieval effectiveness; User need; Ontology"

Along them, monitoring systems were developed in order to increase the quality of the provided services. The research areas in this field have split in two directions: monitoring systems for tracking the products from delivery source to final destination, including temporary storage information along the transportation path and monitoring systems designed to provide environment information during transportation. For some type of products (e.g. food) the quality of the product is highly dependent on the quality of the transportation conditions. This paper describes a monitoring concept based on a wireless sensors network used for environment characterization and product storage during transportation.

The trend towards the application of security control measures which are employed to demonstrate compliance with legislation or regulations, rather than to actually detect or prevent breaches occurring is demonstrated to result in a misallocation of funds. Information security is a risk function. Paying for too much security can be more damaging in economic terms than not buying enough. This research reveals several major misconceptions among businesses about what security really means and that compliance is pursued to the detriment of security. In this paper, we look at some of the causes of compliance based audit failures and why these occur. It is easier to measure compliance than it is to measure security and spending money to demonstrate compliance does not in itself provide security. When the money spent on achieving compliance reduces the funding available for control measures that may actually improve security problems may arise. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Audit; Compliance; Economics; Incentives; Risk; Security","Economics; Laws and legislation; Economics; Laws and legislation; Risks; Security of data; Audit; Compliance; Control measures; Incentives; Information security controls; Risk function; Security; Security controls; Security problems; Audit; Compliance; Control measures; Incentives; Information security controls; Security; Security controls; Security problems; Security of data; Compliance control"

It is crucial for the intrusion alerts management system to correlate the collected intrusion alerts to reflect the causal relationships between the attack steps and construct the attack scenarios. Most of these systems, however, have been built on the relational database logging the intrusion alerts. The relational database has been proven to be a very useful model and applied in the wide area. But their persisting limitation lies in the flat structure which is not capable of representing the complex relations. An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization using an agreed vocabulary. In this paper, ontology is put into use and a learning framework is presented which depicts how the intrusion alerts ontology can be learned and further enriched exploiting both the database schema and the stored data. Moreover, we introduce the vulnerabilities database to refine the ontology hierarchy and the restriction of classes and apply the ontology design pattern to represent the sequence of a series of events.

Design/methodology/ approach - Based on existing literature in strategic management and information security, a theoretical model was proposed and validated. A self-administered survey instrument was developed to collect empirical data. Structural equation modeling was used to test hypotheses and to fit the theoretical model. Findings - Evidence suggests that organizational capabilities, encompassing the ability to develop high-quality situational awareness of the current and future threat environment, the ability to possess appropriate means, and the ability to orchestrate the means to respond to information security threats, are positively associated with effective implementation of information security strategy, which in turn positively affects organization performance. However, there is no significant relationship between decision making and information security strategy implementation success. Research limitations/implications - The study provides a starting point for further research on the role of decision-making in information security. Practical implications - Findings are expected to yield practical value for business leaders in understanding the viable predisposition of organizational capabilities in the context of information security, thus enabling firms to focus on acquiring the ones indispensable for improving organization performance.

The authors in this paper initially present an overview of the case-based learning theory, and proceed with focusing on the lecture's teaching/learning development and delivery material for the undergraduate course MIS 151-Business Software Applications at the University of Nicosia. The results of this case study will offer indications on how to design a case based learning environment in the area of IS or any other course that could be taught through cases. © 2011 IEEE.","inductive methods; information security; problem-based learning; student-centered approach","Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Technical presentations; Academic institutions; Case based learning; Delivery materials; Inductive method; Instructional model; Problem based learning; Security Practice; Software applications; Student-centered approach; Teaching/learning; Undergraduate Courses; Security of data"

Text-based strong password schemes could provide with certain degree of security. However, the fact that strong passwords being difficult to memorize often leads their owners to write them down on papers or even save them in a computer file. Graphical Password or Graphical user authentication (GUA) has been proposed as a possible alternative solution to text-based authentication, motivated particularly by the fact that humans can remember images better than text. All of Graphical Password algorithms have two different aspects which are usability and security. This paper focuses on security aspects of algorithms that most of researchers work on this part and try to define security features and attributes. Unfortunately, till now there isn't a complete evaluation criterion for graphical password security. At first, this paper tries to study on most of GUA algorithm.

The uniqueness of this scheme is, a message is signcrypted by more than two signcrypters and only a designated receiver can verify the signcrypted text. The proposed scheme is convertible as it can easily produce the ordinary signature without the co-operation from any one of the signcrypters. The scheme has been proved to be secure against active attacks, such as, chosen ciphertext attack and forgery attack. In case of a later dispute on repudiation, the recipient has the ability to convert the authenticated signcrypted text into an ordinary one for convincing anyone of the signer's dishonesty. This scheme is more efficient for multi-party applications since the size of the generated signcrypted text is independent of the number of total participating signcrypters. In addition, the computational costs for the verifier will not increase even after increasing the number of signcrypters. This scheme is secure enough to be applicable in practical areas where information security is desirable, such as, press releases, e-commerce applications and digital rights management. © 2011 IEEE.","Convertible scheme; Multi-Signcryption; Multisignature","Copyrights; Information technology; Public relations; Security of data; Active attack; Chosen ciphertext attack; Computational costs; Convertible scheme; Designated receivers; Digital Rights Management; Discrete logarithmic problem; E-Commerce applications; Forgery attacks; Hard problems; Integer factorization problem; Multi-signature; Multi-signcryption; Press release; Cryptography"

Thus, the distribution of high-value, sensitive, and proprietary information across enterprise networks is poorly managed and understood. A significant technology gap in information security is the inability to automatically quantify the value of the information contained on each host in a network. Such insight would allow an enterprise to scale its defenses, react intelligently to an intrusion, manage its configuration audits, and understand the leak potential in the event that a host is compromised. This paper outlines a novel approach to the automated determination of the value of the information contained on a host computer. It involves the classification of each text document on the host machine using the frequency of the document's terms and phrases. A host information value is computed using an enterprise-defined weighting schema and applying it to a host's document distribution. The method is adaptable to specific organizational information needs, requires manual intervention only during schema creation, and is repeatable and consistent regardless of changes in information on the host machines. © 2011 IEEE.","cyber security risk management; document classification; host information value; information asset profiling; security informatics","Artificial intelligence; Industry; Information retrieval systems; Information science; Risk management; Text processing; Cyber security; Document Classification; Information assets; Information value; Security informatics; Security of data"

We envision a separate layer called a ssr Bit-Trap, that employs buffering and bit-padding as orthogonal methods for obfuscating such side channels. For streams of packets, we introduce the use of mutual-information rate as an appropriate metric for the level of obfuscation that captures nonlinear relationships between original and modified streams. Using buffering-delay and average bit-padding as the respective costs, a Bit-Trap formulates a constrained optimization problem with bounds on the average costs, to implement the best possible obfuscation policy. We find that combining small amounts of delay and padding together can create much more obfuscation than either approach alone, and that a simple convex trade-off exists between buffering delay and padding for a given level of obfuscation. © 2011 IEEE.","Computer networks; data privacy; information security; mutual information","Computer privacy; Constrained optimization; Data privacy; Information theory; Average cost; Buffering delay; Communications protocols; Constrained optimization problems; Discrete channel; Encrypted data; Mutual informations; Non-linear relationships; Orthogonal method; Packet streams; Prevent information leakage; Randomized Algorithms; Side-channel; Variable packet size; Computer hardware description languages"

To protect our data against unauthorized access, from the time immemorial the first choice has always been to use cryptography. With rapid growth in the arena of multimedia technology, since digital image has become an important medium of communication, extensive research is still a dynamic process in this field. We also have concentrated on image data encryption in this work. The effectiveness of the protection through encryption depends on the algorithm applied and as well as on the quality of the 'key' used. If a 'key' is badly designed or haphazardly selected, obviously the protection fails to provide proper security and improper access can be gained on the secured information. The first algorithm in cryptographic system design is the algorithm to generate 'key'. It specifies the manner in which the 'key' is to be chosen. This work focuses on a totally new approach towards the 'key' generation for encryption algorithms. Here, Genetic Algorithm (GA), an important method of artificial intelligence has been applied to generate encryption 'key', which plays a vital role in any type of encryption. In our work, a hybridized technique called BlowGA is also proposed which is a combination of Blowfish and GA. Blowfish Algorithm is a conventional method of encryption. Our experimental observations show that the newly-proposed hybridized method BlowGA outperforms both GA and Blowfish Algorithm. © 2011 IEEE.","Cipher Image; Correlation Coefficient; Cryptograph; Genetic Algorithm; Information Security","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Cryptography; Security of data; Systems analysis; Cipher Image; Conventional methods; Correlation Coefficient; Cryptograph; Cryptographic systems; Digital image; Dynamic process; Encryption algorithms; Experimental observation; Genetic algorithm approach; Image data; Multimedia technologies; Rapid growth; Work Focus; Genetic algorithms"

Enterprises often have global security policies to ensure that its information management conforms to business rules and legal mandates. The location of data storage and application execution therefore becomes a critical issue. The prevalence of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) means that applications are often composed from a set of services which form a workflow. The concept of running workflow instances on public cloud processing platforms is in its infancy. The scientific community still needs to define the security issues in public cloud workflow deployment and the requirements of possible solutions that will deal with those concerns. This paper aims to address this by exploring the current information security issues of public cloud workflow deployment within an enterprise setting and by identifying core requirements of solutions needed to deal with these challenges. We argue that enterprises would benefit from an automated and dynamic approach when selecting where to execute workflows and store data. This approach would choose what workflows, or subsets of workflows, can be executed in a public cloud environment while ensuring that enterprise security and compliance needs are met. © 2011 IEEE.","cloud computing; dynamic decision making; information security; workflow","Cloud computing; Decision making; Industry; Information management; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); XML; Application execution; Business rules; Cloud processing; Cost benefits; Critical issues; Data storage; dynamic decision making; Dynamic security; Enterprise security; Global Security; Possible solutions; Running applications; Scientific community; Security issues; Work-flows; workflow; Security of data"

Being an outsource company based in Pakistan, its international clientele were concerned about the security of their proprietary data. The company expected that ISO 27001 certification would help their business development by retaining and acquiring international clients. An ISO team was formed to implement the certification throughout the office and a date in July 2007 was fixed for the final audit, giving the team nine months to complete the implementation. The ISO team faced a great deal of resistance from the Line Managers who were supposed to implement the policies in their respective teams. The Chairman of the ISMF himself was not happy with the direction in which the certification was heading, and he eventually resigned. With the impending external audit coming up, the ISO team leader was worried if they would attain certification. Case B narrates that Kashif Jadoon was made the new ISMF Chairman. Soon after getting on board, Kashif realized that the documentation was complete but when it came to implementation, there were several gaps. Kashif also observed that there was resistance from the Line Managers and their teams. Kashif decided to use a different approach, which he called the 'reverse strategy'. He decided to try to get a consensus across the organization about the need to get the certification. The managers were made accountable for the teams and people would be reported for non-compliance regardless of their designations. The team members were also told about the business value of the certification. Different competitions were held to further motivate the employees. The implementation process started with a new vigour. A second internal audit was conducted by the ISO team to further get the company ready for the final external audit.

Therefore, the reliance on the dynamic signature for authenticating entities in secure system became crucial. In this paper, we investigate the problem of dynamic signature verification and recognition using Ensemble of Classifiers, where we used multiple Fisher based probabilistic neural networks as the component classifiers to construct the Ensemble. Two key issues are studied; the first issue is how to construct the Ensemble. The second issue is how to combine the predictions of the component classifiers in order to accomplish the decision-making process. Data sets from SVC dataset have been used to assess the performance of the proposed ensemble of classifiers. Obtained results are very encouraging and show the ability of ensemble classifiers to deal with the tackled problem. © 2011 IEEE.","Dynamic signature authentication; Ensemble Classifiers; Fisher based Probabilistic Neural Network","Authentication; Computer science; Decision making; Security of data; Component classifiers; Data sets; Decision making process; Dynamic signature; Dynamic signature verification; Ensemble classifiers; Ensemble of classifiers; Probabilistic neural networks; Secure system; Neural networks"

But the vision of world-wide federated Grid infrastructures in analogy to the electrical power Grid is still not seamlessly provided today. This is partly due to the fact, that Grids provide a much more variety of services (job management, data management, information, security, etc.) in comparison with the electrical power Grid, but also we observe a rather slow adoption of the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) concept initially defined as the major Grid reference model architecture roughly one decade ago. This contribution critically reviews OGSA and other related reference models in the field while pointing to significant requirements of an e-science infrastructure interoperability reference model that satisfies the needs of end-users today. We give insights to our findings of the core factors of such reference model requirements including its important major indicators to overcome the known limitations of OGSA.

The development of new physical mechanisms suitable to directly generate random bit sequences is thus a subject of intense current research, with particular interest in alloptical techniques suitable for the generation of data sequences with high bit rate. One such promising technique that has received much recent attention is the chaotic semiconductor laser systems producing high quality random output as a result of the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of its architecture [1]. Here we propose a novel complementary concept of all-optical technique that might dramatically increase the generation rate of random bits by using simultaneously multiple spectral channels with uncorrelated signals - somewhat similar to use of wave-division-multiplexing in communications. We propose to exploit the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of extreme spectral broadening and supercontinuum (SC) generation in optical fibre, a process known to be often associated with non-deterministic fluctuations [2]. In this paper, we report proof-of concept results indicating that the fluctuations in highly nonlinear fibre SC generation can potentially be used for random number generation. © 2011 IEEE.","","Chaotic systems; Dynamics; Electron optics; Information technology; Lasers; Nonlinear optics; Optical fibers; Quantum electronics; Security of data; Semiconductor lasers; All-optical; Central component; Chaotic semiconductor lasers; Data sequences; Generation rate; High bit rates; High quality; Highly non-linear fibres; ITS architecture; Physical mechanism; Random bits; Spectral broadening; Spectral channels; Supercontinuum generations; Uncorrelated signals; Random number generation"

Risk assessment is the widely accepted process used to understand, quantify, and document the effects of undesirable events on organizational objectives so that risk management, continuity of operations planning, and contingency planning can be performed. One technique, the Cyberspace Security Econometrics System (CSES), is a methodology for estimating security costs to stakeholders as a function of possible risk postures. In earlier works, we presented a computational infrastructure that allows an analyst to estimate the security of a system in terms of the loss that each stakeholder stands to sustain, as a result of security breakdowns. Additional work has applied CSES to specific business cases. The current state-of-the-art of CSES addresses independent events. In typical usage, analysts create matrices that capture their expert opinion, and then use those matrices to quantify costs to stakeholders. This expansion generalizes CSES to the common real-world case where events may be dependent. © 2011 IEEE.","Algorithms; Cybersecurity Metrics; Information Assurance Controls; Information Security; Mitigation Costs; Risk Analysis; Risk Management; Stakeholder Value","Artificial intelligence; Economics; Information systems; Planning; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Business case; Computational infrastructure; Contingency planning; Cyber security; Cyberspaces; Decision criterions; Expert opinion; Information assurance; Information system architecture; Information system security; Mitigation costs; Operations planning; Security incident; Stakeholder values; Security of data"

The primary reason is when infrastructure is used to support essential business operations, such as manufacturing or assembling products, delivering goods, and providing services. The increasing use of information systems to support and enable critical infrastructure introduces a new set of risks that organizations need to navigate when meeting the security requirements relating to critical infrastructure. These include availability, reliability and resilience. Securing infrastructure requires an understanding and agreement of what the critical infrastructure for the organization actually is. Once the identification and agreement is complete, an information risk analysis of those supporting information systems should be undertaken. Once the risk analysis is complete, a control framework for critical infrastructure needs to be established.","","Information systems; Public works; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Security of data; Business operation; Control framework; Information risk; Information security forums; Research analysts; Security requirements; Critical infrastructures"

For reasons of ensuring privacy, we adopt the notion of l-Diversity in the course of collecting intrusion logs from organizations. Within our framework, an organization ensures the people in the center cannot discern the exact origin of any intrusion log among the other l-1 organizations. Also, it is not possible to precisely identify the classification type of an intrusion log from among other l-1 types. Within this framework, the intrusion log management center can analyze the anonymous data, since the proposed privacy preserving solution creates little information loss. If required, it sends an alarm to the appropriate organization within a reasonable time. The center has the option of publishing useful information security statistics about specific organizations or about the whole ecosystem by using the privacy preserved intrusion logs. © 2011 Cooperative Cyber Defenc.","intrusion detection; log sharing; privacy preserving framework","Data privacy; Information management; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Computer emergency response teams; Critical information; Information loss; Intrusion Detection Systems; Log managements; log sharing; Management service; Privacy preserving; Intrusion detection"

This paper examines the traditional strategic deterrence theory and its application to deterrence in cyberspace (the newly defined 5th battlespace domain, following land, air, sea and space domains), which is being used increasingly by nation-states and their proxies to achieve information dominance and to gain tactical and strategic economic and military advantage. It presents a taxonomy of cyberattacks that identifies which types of threats in the confidentiality, integrity, availability cybersecurity model triad present the greatest risk to nation-state economic and military security, including their political and social facets. The argument is presented that attacks on confidentiality cannot be subject to deterrence in the current international legal framework and that the focus of strategy needs to be applied to integrity and availability attacks. A potential cyberdeterrence strategy is put forth that can enhance national security against devastating cyberattacks through a credible declaratory retaliation capability that establishes red lines which may trigger a counter-strike against all identifiable responsible parties. The author believes such strategy can credibly influence nation-state threat actors who themselves exhibit serious vulnerabilities to cyber attacks from launching a devastating cyber first strike. © 2011 Cooperative Cyber Defenc.","availability; confidentiality; counter-strike; cyberdeterrence; cyberspace; first-strike; integrity; strategy","Computer crime; confidentiality; counter-strike; cyberdeterrence; Cyberspaces; first-strike; integrity; strategy; Computers"

Recently, biometric cryptosystems have been introduced as a reliable way of concealing private keys by using biometric data. A fuzzy vault refers to a biometric cryptosystem that can be used to effectively protect private keys and to release them only when legitimate users enter their biometric data. Distance metric such as hamming distance is used for the template matching identification process. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the various systems and it shows that, R-S cryptographic algorithm can obtain a higher security with a low false rejection or false acceptance rate comparing to other techniques. © 2011 IEEE.","Algorithms; Authentication; Biometrics; Encryption; Hamming distance; Iris","Algorithms; Authentication; Biometrics; Fuzzy logic; Hamming distance; Image matching; Information technology; Physiological models; Process control; Reed-Solomon codes; Security of data; Template matching; Algorithmic techniques; Biometric data; Cryptographic algorithms; Cryptographic key; Cryptographic techniques; Distance metrics; Encryption and decryption; Encryption technique; False acceptance rate; False rejection; Fuzzy vault; Human being; Identification process; Iris; Iris images; Iris recognition; Iris template; Legitimate users; Personal authentication; Physiological parameters; Private key; Recent trends; Reed solomon; Cryptography"

For most system managers, getting to know the status of all devices immediately, initiating the recovery procedures automatically while abnormal conditions happened and then rendering a list of records and reports correspondingly are great expectations in their daily management activities. However, in practice, it is very hard for a system manager to get the real-time status of all systems and devices because he/she has to learn different kinds of query instructions and management methods in a complex environment. To cope with the above problems, we developed a real-time and automatic recovery system, which was built with LAMP utilities and related tools, such as SNMP Expect and Nmap. With this system, a manager can monitor all the asset information of systems and devices and all of their operating status, and then facilitate his/her management work accordingly. The experimental results show that this system not only saves the manpower and time of management, but also makes the management of asset information much easier and more effective. © ICIC International 2011.","Automatically recovery system; ISMS (Information Security Management System); LAMP utilities","Computer system recovery; Heterogeneous networks; Managers; Real time systems; Recovery; Security of data; Abnormal conditions; Automatic recovery; Complex environments; Cross-platform; ISMS (Information Security Management System); LAMP utilities; Management activities; Management method; Real-time networks; Recovery procedure; Recovery systems; Information management"

This paper proposes a business oriented risk assessment model BoRAM. On the basis of the business security requirements, the proposed model introduces three basic security goals (i. e. confidentiality, integrity and availability) into the process of the risk assessment, and further measures the risk according to the effect on business process. In the proposed model, the asset is not only severed as a basic evaluation element as same as the role in the traditional risk assessment models, but also is served as the support of the business. The risk of the asset, the risk of the business process, and the risk of the business are analyzed hierarchically. In order to measure these risks, all the risk elements are generalized and analyzed by attribute-oriented induction (AOI) as well as cluster algorithm. Furthermore, the Markov model is also introduced into the business to describe the transfer between business processes. Finally, the model is experimented in a typical Internet-bank business. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed model can evaluate the business risk instead of traditional asset risk on the basis of confidentiality, integrity and availability of business, which is just the goal of the business security requirements.","AOI; Business process; Business security requirement; Markov model; Risk assessment","Markov processes; Rating; Security of data; AOI; Assessment models; Attribute oriented induction; Business process; Business risks; Business security; Business security requirement; Cluster algorithms; Information security risk assessment; Markov model; Risk elements; Security goals; Risk assessment"

Similar to other critical infrastructure industries such as banking, transportation, and the cross-sector critical information infrastructure industry, the electric industry must protect itself from intentional and unintentional security breaches and incidents to ensure uninterrupted operations of essential services. Of the critical infrastructure industries, the electric industry is the only private-sector industry subject to government-enforced mandatory cybersecurity standards. This article presents an overview of the eight mandatory cybersecurity standards by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. As an example of how standards are evolving, it discusses CIP-002 (Critical Cyber Asset Identification) in depth because it establishes whether the remaining seven standards apply. This article then compares the North American Electric Reliability Corporation regulatory framework against critical information infrastructure goals. The comparison finds that, at least on a basic level, the electric industry's mandatory cybersecurity standards meet the critical information infrastructure goals and work to secure information networks, resources, and systems from cyber and physical threats. The mandatory cybersecurity standards promote an increase in technological products, better security management, personnel and public education, and trust in the industry. Even though the electric industry's mandatory standards are imperfect, the fact it satisfies the goals of the cross-sector critical information infrastructure indicates that the framework is sound. The electric industry's experience with mandatory cybersecurity standards is a valuable source of information, and the regulatory framework itself can be a helpful model for other industries looking to develop their own security protection systems.

An agent-based discrete event simulation is used to model a sensor communication network consisting of UAVs, military communications satellites, ground relay stations, and a mission control center. Network susceptibility to cyber attack is modeled with probabilistic failures and induced data variability, with performance metrics focusing on information availability, latency, and trustworthiness. Results demonstrated that using UAVs as routers increased SoS availability and satellite-based networks were best for long distance operations. Redundancy in the number of links between nodes helped mitigate cyber-caused link failures and add robustness in cases of induced data variability.

These are mainly used for the command & control of spacecraft and the exploitation and dissemination of space-based services to end users. A new ESA activity, the European Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Initiative, requires a novel generation of mission data systems to be developed. These systems are based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and capable of supporting a large system-of-systems environment. At the same time, information security is an area of growing concern in the space business and among space agencies. Especially in the area of SOA-based environments, where interconnectivity of components is a core principle, an efficient and robust security concept needs to be put in place to ensure secure mission operations. In this paper, we describe an application security framework for SOA-based mission data systems. This framework increases significantly the robustness and security of web services and web applications through use of a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) and provision of tools & templates for SSA mission data system developers. We are confident that the application security framework will drastically improve the security and robustness of SOA-based mission data systems that will be used in the European SSA Initiative and other ESA projects, while at the same time keeping the related additional effort minimal. © 2011 IEEE.","Information security; Secure software development lifecycle; Service-oriented architectures; Software engineering; System-of-systems","Information services; Information technology; Interplanetary flight; Life cycle; Martian surface analysis; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Software design; Software engineering; Web services; Application security; End users; Interconnectivity; Mission Data Systems; Mission operations; Robust security; Secure software development; Service Oriented; Space agency; Space business; Space situational awareness; Space-based; System-of-Systems; Time keeping; WEB application; Security of data"

The fact that there is no central infrastructure and that the devices can move randomly gives rise to various kind of problems, such as routing and security. Attacks on routing protocols can create various undesirable effects that defeat the objectives of ad-hoc routing, Ad hoc networks is much more vulnerable to malicious exploits than a wired network. Secure communication is an important aspect of any network environment. Therefore to provide secure ad hoc network: authentication, confidentiality, integrity, non repudiation and access control should be provided. Authentication comes in the first place to ensure secure network operation, since other services depend on the authentication of communication entities. In mobile ad hoc, there is possibility of nodes being compromise, therefore, the network should not have any central control but instead have distributed architecture; when avoiding central control it's more difficult to implement authentication protocol. In this paper, the recently developed identity based scheme with threshold secret sharing will be used in two different scenarios; in the first scenario the serving nodes have been assumed fixed nodes, in the second scenario the serving nodes have been assumed mobile nodes. The purpose of applying this scheme is to provide authentication, confidentiality, reduce computation cost, avoiding central control and find out the proper threshold value. The authentication protocol has been implemented, tested and compared with central serving control using computer simulator method. The simulator that has been used to simulate the ad hoc authentication protocol is a self developed simulator. © 2011 IEEE.","Ad hoc network; Authentication; Information security","Authentication; Communication; Cryptography; Mobile ad hoc networks; Security of data; Simulators; Telecommunication networks; Ad hoc authentication; Ad hoc routing; Ad-hoc networking; Authentication protocols; Central control; Central infrastructure; Communication entities; Computation costs; Distributed architecture; Fixed nodes; ID-based; Identity-based; Mobile ad hoc; Mobile nodes; Network environments; Non repudiation; Portable device; Secure ad-hoc network; Secure communications; Secure networks; Security scheme; Serving nodes; Threshold secret sharing; Undesirable effects; Wired networks; Ad hoc networks"

The science and technology education is, of course, not the exemption. But in these days around 2000 it seems that the public pays little attention on the science and technology, as they are quite day to day matters.

But currently they can not help facing with risks of social issues like patent rights, troubles and accidents due to application of high technology, information security in the use of computers and engineering ethics.

The design of algorithms to leverage this structured relationship with the power of computing to assist researchers and practitioners for better understanding, exploration and navigation of this space of information has become a challenging, albeit rewarding, topic in social network analysis and data mining. The constantly growing scale and enriching genres of network data always demand higher levels of efficiency, robustness and generalizability where existing approaches with successes on small, homogeneous network data are likely to fall short. We introduce MultiAspectForensics, a handy tool to automatically detect and visualize novel subgraph patterns within a local community of nodes in a heterogenous network, such as a set of vertices that form a dense bipartite graph whose edges share exactly the same set of attributes. We apply the proposed method on three data sets from distinct application domains, present empirical results and discuss insights derived from these patterns discovered.

The intrusion detection rate of the transportation information security system is often affected by the structure parameter design of the support vector machine (SVM) model. Improper SVM model design may lead to a low detection precision. To overcome these problems, a new intrusion detection method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and SVM is proposed in this paper. The KPCA was adopted to obtain the useful features of the original data to eliminate the redundancy. Then the PSO was employed to optimize the training procedure of the SVM. Thus, satisfactory SVM model with good extendable ability was attained. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the KDD dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods, and thus is available for the transportation information security. © 2011 IEEE.","KPCA; PSO; SVM; Transportation information security","Chemical detection; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Principal component analysis; Security systems; Structural design; Intrusion detection method; KDD dataset; Kernel principal component analysis; KPCA; PSO; Structure parameter; SVM; SVM model; Traffic information; Training procedures; Intrusion detection"

Six-page structured questionnaires were distributed to 400 potential customers. Semi-structure in-depth interview and focus group technique were employed to service provider and experienced business owner informants. The GIS call center service was interested by majority of end customer informants, especially in home patients with chronic illness and high-income group. Confidential and responsiveness to urgent needs were expected by potential organization and individual customers. The research revealed that the most value added of the GIS call center was to the health care sector in form of rescue system. Moreover, to enhance the collaboration among related service providers of the rescue system and to ensure information security, a government agency would be the host of the Geographic Names Information System, (GNIS) management. A suggested business strategy for implementation was to establish a one-stop service called iRescue Hub for GIS call center providing all emergency rescue service in order to be a centralized of information flow and dispatching the call to appropriated agencies.

The access control models today are mostly static and they are not wellsuited for the service-oriented environments where information access is dynamic in nature. Traditional authorization security techniques do not directly address these concerns as they primarily use access control lists for authorization, where the user whose name appears in the list is authorized to access the grid with some privileges associated with the names, which requires the resource provider to maintain authorization decisions for every user, which is very time consuming and non-scalable solution. Approach: Organizations pass user roles instead of name and date of birth but it used Public Key Infrastructure user certificate for authorization which is inflexible when it comes to open distributed systems (Grid) as it assumes a pre-agreed trust between Service Provider and the Service consumer. Usage of Java authentication and authorization services is performed in a pluggable fashion. It permits the application to remain independent from underlying authentication technology. Results: Our implementation provides service providers with full control over authentication and authorization of accounts that access services. Implementation of the proposed technique has proved to be less time consuming and more secured for authentication and authorization as compared to the traditional way of authenticating the users. The Policy Decision Service is envisioned to be used by many Web services protected by their PEPs. Conclusion: The model brings out many advantages over traditional identity. It is more flexible and more powerful and is suited for dynamic environments for Web services. © 2011 Science Publications.","Authentication technology; Authorization decision; Authorization service; Decision point; Login module; Policy file; Preferred customers; Public key; Traditional authorization; Underlying authentication; Web services",""

This set will serve as a foundation of our future development towards a security management architecture for the Inter-Cloud. © 2011 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Cloud security management; Inter-cloud; Security management infrastructure","Dynamic models; Environmental management; Industrial management; Information management; Security of data; Communication infrastructure; Distributed management task force; Distributed service; Dynamic re-configuration; European network and information security agencies; Functional aspects; Inter-cloud; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Public sector; Security challenges; Security controls; Security management; Security mechanism; Technology forum; Cloud computing"

Perhaps it is time to use a model that has been effective in another challenging international arena, money laundering. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which started as an effort among the economic leaders in the world, uses an intergovernmental policy group to build political will to counter a network threat. With its best practices, regional sub-groups, and threat of blacklisting, it is effective in bringing pressure to bear on recalcitrant nations. A FATF style cyber security body offers a means to improve the global governance regime for the Internet by leveraging the will of interested governments. This paper offers an outline of how the FATF model could be applied to the Internet, and thereby improve governance and security. © 2011 EWI.","Cooperation; Cybersecurity; Governance; International; Security","Internet; Cooperation; Cyber security; Governance; International; Security; Telecommunication networks"

The paper points out the unique aspects of cloud computing architecture and operation and cloud-specific security issues. These cloud-specific issues could have an impact on a number of areas of offering information security. We discuss its impact on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection, organizations extending protection beyond the traditional notion of perimeter defence, and on attack surfaces.

We provide efficient centralized and fully-distributed heuristics, and prove the convergence property of the distributed process.

The duty of reconstructing complete attack scenarios is left to system administrators because current Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are still oriented to generate alerts related to single attacks, with no or minimal correlation. We propose a novel approach for the automatic analysis of multiple security alerts generated by state-of-the-art signature-based NIDS. Our proposal is able to group security alerts that are likely to belong to the same attack scenario, and to identify correlations and causal relationships among them. This goal is achieved by combining alert classification through Self Organizing Maps and unsupervised clustering algorithms.

However, because the environments where malwares operate are characterized by high levels of imprecision and vagueness, the conventional data analysis tools lack to deal with these computer safety applications.

To ensure their privacy and realize information security, controlling data access is paramount. However, limited research was found on issues that emerge when realizing data access control in inter-organizational collaboration. Security is typically achieved by implementing security patterns, which are proven technical solutions. This paper explores data control issues for realizing information security by looking at the application of security patterns in practice. By investigating a case study of inter-organizational collaboration in the Netherlands we explore the use of two security patterns that control access to information: Extended Role-Based Access Control (ERBAC) and Single Access Point/Check Point. We investigated whether those patterns were implemented in the right way and whether they were sufficient for guaranteeing access control. We found issues related to access control to be crucial in realizing information security, which can only be realized by implementing organizational arrangements in addition to technical solutions. Therefore, we recommend development of a framework for information security in interorganizational collaboration including technical and organizational aspects. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","e-Government; Information Security; Inter-Organizational Collaboration; Security Patterns","Government data processing; Security systems; Government data processing; Security of data; Access points; Control access; Data access; Data access control; Data control; e-Government; Interorganizational collaboration; Multiple organizations; Netherlands; Organizational aspects; Public organizations; Public sector; Role-based Access Control; Security patterns; Service delivery; Technical solutions; E-governments; Extended role based access control; Interorganizational collaboration; Multiple organizations; Organizational aspects; Public organizations; Security patterns; Technical solutions; Access control; Access control"

Approach: The robustness is achieved through combining proven security measures combined with usability aspects. The study demonstrates acceptance of such robustness particularly in a SNS to update user's profile. The study discuss on three related components that were considered for the proposed security measures, namely shared keys based on passwords security methods, personalized questions and one time passwords. The study elaborated shared key for authentication. The keys were calculated based on communication entities at the user's site. Shared key methods have proved to be effective in withstanding general attacks. Most of information security and network security protocols provide security and preserve secrecy based on cryptography techniques. Results: While the keys could be generated through conventional password based key generation algorithm, the security can also be enhanced by using personalized questions in addition to the password. The study proposed certain ideal security key that would be generated through socially surveyed personalized questions and password. This key would then become a onetime password for the users for a particular login session. While the keys when generated through highly secured manner and used for mutual authentication, social studies have pointed out to usability weakness. Conclusion: This study validated social acceptance in introducing personalized questions that would generate keys for authentication. The study elaborates both authentication technique as well as the social responses on personalized password questions. The personalized password questions have been designed from commonly used security questions like ones that asked to those who have lost their passwords. These questions need to be looked from social angle rather than technical angle. A social survey was conducted restricted to southern India. Based on the responses the questions have been designed and administered in a social network site to generate the keys for authentication purposes.

Digital Rights Management (DRM) was developed to help organizations keep digital documents secure, as one of many digital information security solutions. In this study, the functions of eight popular DRM products currently available on the market are reviewed, and the impact of using of these DRM products is evaluated quantitatively. A group of metrics is defined reflecting the potential costs and impact to the organization incurred by implementing DRM products. Stochastic models are used to quantitatively evaluate the costs and impact of implementing a particular DRM product. In this study, it is found that although DRM products protect digital assets by encryption and by providing central control on information within the organization, this comes at a cost, since these security mechanisms typically reduce the productivity of the staff. The reduction in productivity is in turn measured in the form of non-productive time (NPT) which is an inherent part of the stochastic modeling process. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","digital security; DRM products; information help desk; non-productive time; Petri-nets; stochastic modeling","Costs; Productivity; Security of data; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Digital security; DRM products; Help Desk; Non-productive time; Stochastic modeling; Copyrights"

Secondly, the system can be used in LAN sharing and it ensures the safety of data which is transmitted from one operator to another. At last, the system can automatically record the user's computer information and store them in the file which is operated.

The study concludes that from information security perspective there are service design and service performance gaps impacting service delivery of Indian Software Service Providers. However these gaps still put India at par with various countries, if not ahead with respect to information security practices, since the service quality gaps model is primarily customer driven.

In the past two years, more and more scholars concerned adoption and compliance behavior of information systems security technology. Most of these studies examined the predictors to security technology adoption in organizations based on traditional the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the technology acceptance model (TAM), the protection motivation theory (PMT), and their extensions. The scholars have distinct contributions but few of them examined security technology adoption from the risky decision-making perspective. Based on the research of risky decision behavior as well as the extension of both TAM and PMT, this study proposes a conceptual model that employs risk-related factors to predict managerial attitude toward adopting security technologies. Unlike most works that merely consider perceived usefulness of technology from the positive benefits perspective, this study suggests that the downside of risk is a major determinant of managerial behavior in adopting security technology. This study places two perceived risks and decision-maker risk propensity into the model to clarify the relationships between the three risk-related factors and perceived usefulness, as well as their effects on security technology adoption.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study is conducted with a retail organisation, and an educational institution in Cape Town, South Africa. Using purposive sampling, interviews are held with network administrators of sample institutions to unpack security priorities and the functionalities of IDSs, the significance of the system in concept, whether it is understood within network departments, the cost factor, and its value in securing networks against all possible security challenges. The activity theory is applied as a lens to understanding the security process, and to inform a future security frameworks and research initiatives. Findings: The findings are clear. Although IDSs have vulnerabilities, they offer an added cushion to conventional network access control efforts. Access control for example, guards the gate but IDSs are the watchdogs in your yard, and IDS closes a gap in a network security that only IDSs can. It alerts you of a potential attacker, enabling you to respond promptly, in whichever way you like. It does however, require deliberate reaction against a detected intrusion to be effective, but remains a useful security tool that should become standard to all network security initiatives. A framework presenting network security as a work activity - with actors who are guided by goals - is offered to guide planning, implementations of network security and further research in future. Originality/value: Security awareness is crucial to effective e-citizenry, but complacency could be a threat. As a unique contribution, the paper presents an activity-theory work-activity framework of analysing network security. Further, the paper presents original, industry-specific interview findings, raising awareness that existing security measures need to be viewed as a continuous work-activity whose planning and implementations are embedded on goals and processes towards pursued outcomes. Access controls themselves should be monitored. They should be supplemented by effective intrusion detection systems if unauthorised access is to be effectively minimised. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Access control; Computer crime; Data security; Intrusion detection systems; Security as work-activity; Security threats; Vulnerability","Access control; Activity coefficients; Computer crime; Engineering research; Intrusion detection; Security systems; Activity Theory; Cape Town , South Africa; Cost factors; Design/methodology/approach; Educational institutions; Electronic information; Electronic information resources; Intrusion detection systems; Network access control; Network administrator; Research initiatives; Security as work-activity; Security awareness; Security challenges; Security frameworks; Security measure; Security threats; Security tools; Vulnerability; Work activities; Network security"

The method uses multiple antennas at the base station and a single antenna at the mobile terminal. The expected mobile terminal (target user) first transmits a training symbol which is used by the base station to estimate the channel. The base station then randomly selects several antennas to transmit each symbol. The weighting coefficients are obtained according to the estimated channel, which is similar to the distributed beamforming except that the magnitudes are random in this paper. Signals from all the selected antennas are finally superimposed in phase at the target user so that the maximum likelihood demodulation can be directly implemented. The RAS makes the channel for an eavesdropper change fast and randomly to prevent the eavesdropper from demodulating the signals. Simulation results show that the target user's bit error rate of RAS is lower with less transmission power than the traditional method of using random weighting coefficients, while the eavesdropper cannot correctly demodulate and hence the low probability of interception is achieved. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","antenna array; beamforming; low probability of interception; physical layer security; wireless communication","Antenna arrays; Base stations; Beamforming; Bit error rate; Computer terminals; Demodulation; Image processing; Imaging systems; Local area networks; Maximum likelihood; Mobile phones; Receiving antennas; Security of data; Wireless telecommunication systems; Antenna switching; Distributed beamforming; In-phase; low probability of interception; Low probability of interceptions; Maximum likelihood demodulations; Mobile terminal; Multiple antenna; physical layer security; Physical layers; Secure wireless communication; Simulation result; Single antenna; Training symbols; Transmission power; Weighting coefficient; wireless communication; Mobile antennas"

This paper uses resolution-progressive compression (RPC) technique to achieve better result. RPC compresses an encrypted image progressively in resolution, such that the decoder can observe a low-resolution version of the image, study local statistics based on it, and use the statistics to decode the next resolution level.

There is no consensus on the definition of a PHR or PHR system even within the professional societies of health information technology. Objective: Our objective was to analyze and classify the opinions of health information professionals regarding the definitions of the PHR. Method: Q methodology was used to explore the concept of the PHR. A total of 50 Q-statements were selected and rated by 45 P-samples consisting of health information professionals. We analyzed the resulting data by using Q methodology-specific software and SPSS. Result: We selected five types of health information professionals' opinions: type I, public interest centered; type II, health information standardization centered; type III, health consumer centered; type IV, health information security centered; and type V, health consumer convenience centered. The Q-statements with the highest levels of agreement were as follows: (1) the PHR is the lifetime record of personal health information, (2) the PHR is the representation of health 2.0, and (3) security is the most important requirement of the PHR. The most disagreed-with Q-statements were (1) the PHR is a paper-based system, and (2) it is most effective to carry the PHR information in USB storage. Conclusion: Health information professionals agree that PHRs should be lifetime records, that they will be useful as more information is stored electronically, and that data security is paramount. To maximize the benefits of PHR, activation strategies should be developed and extended across disciplines and professionals so that patients begin to receive the benefits associate with using PHRs. © 2011 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The proposed solution enables secure authentication and communication between a mobile device and a healthcare service provider through usage of a two-factor authentication method on a mobile phone and encryption. The proposed solution is independent of mobile network provider and type of the mobile device the application is running on, and provides multifactor authentication without the traditional requirement that the user has an additional authentication token.

Potential benefits of cloud computing include reducing IT capital expenditure, providing rapid dynamic scaling of resources on a metered basis, as well as transparency related to platforms, storage, transmission and processing of data. However, these benefits come with many potential problems. There is an urgent need to investigate and understand security assurance in cloud computing. Small to medium enterprises (SMEs) may be unable to dedicate specialized staff and other resources to this end. This paper argues that emerging taxonomies, frameworks and guidelines, collectively referred to as instruments in this paper, can facilitate SME enquiry into cloud computing. The instruments have been developed and refined by industry and government consortia. Yet, these instruments are rarely referenced in the academic literature, drawing attention to a continuing gap between industry and academia. The proposal is oriented in the context of a prevailing definition and model of cloud computing. Potential benefits and drawbacks in cloud computing are presented. Organizations responsible for developing the instruments are depicted followed by the systematic approach based upon the cloud instruments.

Therefore hospital information security and privacy are major issues that cannot be ignored. For the information security management, ISO/IEC 27001 is the most important standards and it plays an important role while the organizations are considering strengthening their security management. This research uses case study methods to observe and understand the information security management system of our research subject. We used the nominal group technique (NGT) that was developed on the basis of ""ISO/IEC 27001""to develop models that could verify their information security management systems.

These information risks confronting organisations can be mitigated by the implementation of information security standards. In this study, we investigated the lacking adoption of the Information Security Management System (ISMS) standard in the USA. We argued that the primary cause for the low adoption level is the failure to financially justify ISMS related investments. Using the event study method, we examined whether organisations that have adopted the ISMS standard have realised any financial gains.

However, the open-access that defines such systems can also be utilized for nefarious purposes. In particular, this paper examines the use of collaborative functionality to add inappropriate hyperlinks to destinations outside the host environment (i.e., link spam). The collaborative encyclopedia, Wikipedia, is the basis for our analysis. Recent research has exposed vulnerabilities in Wikipedia's link spam mitigation, finding that human editors are latent and dwindling in quantity. To this end, we propose and develop an autonomous classifier for link additions. Such a system presents unique challenges. For example, low barriers-to-entry invite a diversity of spam types, not just those with economic motivations. Moreover, issues can arise with how a link is presented (regardless of the destination). In this work, a spam corpus is extracted from over 235,000 link additions to English Wikipedia. From this, 40+ features are codified and analyzed. These indicators are computed using wiki metadata, landing site analysis, and external data sources. The resulting classifier attains 64% recall at 0.5% false-positives (ROC-AUC= 0.97). Such performance could enable egregious link additions to be blocked automatically with low false-positive rates, while prioritizing the remainder for human inspection. Finally, a live Wikipedia implementation of the technique has been developed. © 2011 ACM.","collaboration; collaborative security; information security; intelligent routing; link spam; machine-learning; reputation; spam mitigation; spatio-temporal features; Wikipedia","Hypertext systems; Metadata; Security of data; User interfaces; collaboration; collaborative security; Intelligent routing; link spam; Machine-learning; reputation; spam mitigation; Spatio-temporal; Wikipedia; Internet"

The complexity, accessibility, and openness of the Internet have served to increase the security risk of information systems tremendously. Intrusions pose a serious security risk in a network environment. The normal and the abnormal behaviors in networked computers are hard to predict, as the boundaries cannot be well defined. This prediction process usually generates false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced, where a set of fuzzy rules is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network, and a fuzzy inference engine can be applied over such rules to determine intrusions. This paper proposes a technique with genetic algorithm to generate fuzzy rules instead of manual design that are able to detect anomalies and some specific intrusions. Experiments were performed with DARPA data sets, during normal behavior and intrusive behavior. This paper presents some results and reports the performance of generated fuzzy rules in classifying different types of intrusions. © 2011 IEEE.","fuzzy classification; genetic algorithm; intrusion detection","Artificial intelligence; Errors; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Information technology; Internet; Telecommunication networks; Abnormal behavior; Anomaly based intrusion detection systems; Data sets; Evolving fuzzy classifiers; False alarm rate; False alarms; Fuzzy classification; Manual design; Network environments; Networked computers; Normal behavior; Prediction process; Security risks; Intrusion detection"

Quantum steganography can be regarded as the quantum analog of classical one. In this paper, we firstly propose a new subset generation method according to accompanying codeword, and then present a novel quantum steganography protocol with optimal private-key scheme. The new protocol camouflages noise to build up the hidden channel within codewords of quantum error-correcting codes passing through a quantum channel.

Departing from the common practice of using survival as a measure of entrepreneurial performance, we model both failure and cashout (liquidity event) as conditioned by the same underlying process. High-opportunity-cost entrepreneurs prefer a shorter time to success, even if this also implies failing more quickly, whereas entrepreneurs with fewer outside alternatives will choose less aggressive strategies and, consequently, linger on longer. We formalize this intuition with a simple model. Using a novel data set of information security start-ups, we find that entrepreneurs with high opportunity costs are not only more likely to cash out more quickly but are also more likely to fail faster. Not only is survival a poor indicator of performance, but its use as one obscures the relationship between entrepreneurial characteristics, entrepreneurial strategies, and outcomes. © 2011 INFORMS.","Entrepreneurship; Opportunity costs; Performance","Costs; Data sets; Entrepreneurial opportunities; Entrepreneurship; Opportunity costs; Performance; Start-ups; Security of data"

To implement the fuzzy fingerprint vault as a complete system, we have to consider several practical issues such as automatic fingerprint alignment, verification accuracy, execution time, error correcting code, etc. In addition, to protect the fuzzy fingerprint vault from the correlation attack, we propose an approach to insert chaffs in a structured way such that distinguishing the fingerprint minutiae and the chaff points obtained from two applications is computationally hard.

Such a system must often offer high guarantees in terms of its availability; in other words, to guarantee business continuity, IT systems can afford very little downtime. Unfortunately, making an assessment of IT availability risks is difficult: incidents affecting the availability of a marginal component of the system may propagate in unexpected ways to other more essential components that functionally depend on them. General-purpose risk assessment (RA) methods do not provide technical solutions to deal with this problem. In this paper we present the qualitative time dependency (QualTD) model and technique, which is meant to be employed together with standard RA methods for the qualitative assessment of availability risks based on the propagation of availability incidents in an IT architecture. The QualTD model is based on our previous quantitative time dependency (TD) model (Zambon et al. in BDIM '07: Second IEEE/IFIP international workshop on business-driven IT management. IEEE Computer Society Press, pp 75-83, 2007), but provides more flexible modelling capabilities for the target of assessment. Furthermore, the previous model required quantitative data which is often too costly to acquire, whereas QualTD applies only qualitative scales, making it more applicable to industrial practice.

In order to ensure information security, organisations normally introduce policies and guidelines which are made available to all members. Despite this effort however, security threats on organisations' information still occur. One of the reasons is because organisations are not aware of the information security levels that they practise. This paper discusses a measurement model for assessing information security implementation levels in organisations. The model consists of three maturity levels that determine the degrees of which information security is addressed in an organisation. The levels contain several factors that are necessary for ensuring information security. The study used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the instruments to determine the appropriate measurement parameters. The identified parameters were combined with general models and measurement standards of information security. The model can be used by organisations to determine their levels of maturity in ensuring the security of their information. This enables them to improve their current information security practices. © 2011 IEEE.","information security; maturity model; measurement; security level","Electrical engineering; Information science; Security systems; Societies and institutions; Assessment models; General model; Identified parameter; Information security practice; Maturity levels; Maturity model; Measurement model; Measurement parameters; Measurement standards; Security level; Security threats; Systematic literature review; Security of data"

Outsourcing, however, introduces new challenges with respect to ensuring the security and the privacy of the data. In addition to the need for standard access control policies, organizations must now be concerned with the privacy of their data and so hiding the data from the service provider is important. Simply encrypting the data before it is transmitted to the service provider is inefficient and vulnerable to security attacks when the access control policies change. Approaches based on two layers of encryption alleviate the privacy concern but still require re-encryption of the data when policies change. This paper presents a novel and efficient solution that employs two layers of encryption of the data and an encrypted data object containing the second access key. Changes to the access control policies are handled by re-encrypting the object containing the affected key, which is an efficient operation.

This is partly motivated by the increased risk of natural disasters such as flooding, earthquakes, and fires, and partly due to the risks and consequent impact of terrorist attacks. This article focuses on the experience from the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme project known as EULER, which seeks to demonstrate the benefits of software defined radio technology to support the resolution of natural disasters of significant stature, which require the participation of different public safety and military organizations, potentially of different nations. In such scenarios, the presence of interoperability barriers in the disaster area is a major challenge because different organizations may use different wireless communication systems. In this context, the main aspect investigated in EULER is the definition of a common waveform that respects the software communications architecture constraints, and guarantees maximum portability across SDR platforms. This article discusses a range of issues that have been identified thus far within the EULER project; in particular, the perceived pan-European interoperability needs of public safety, and coordination with military devices and networks. Aspects of interoperability are also extended to the three dimensions of platform, waveform, and information assurance. © 2011 IEEE.","","Communication systems; Computer software portability; Disasters; Global system for mobile communications; Interoperability; Military communications; Software architecture; Wireless telecommunication systems; Disaster areas; European Commission; Information assurance; Military organizations; Natural disasters; Public safety; Security operations; Software communications architectures; Software defined radio technologies; Software-defined radios; Terrorist attacks; Three dimensions; Wave forms; Wireless communication system; Radio"

In this study, the traditional approach to an information security awareness program is extended to include possible cultural factors relating to people from diverse backgrounds. The human factor, consisting of two closely related dimensions, namely knowledge and behaviour, play a significant role in the field of ICT security. In addition, cultural factors also impact on the security knowledge and behaviour of people as cultural differences may manifest themselves in different levels of security awareness. An information security vocabulary test was used to assess the level of awareness pertaining to the two human dimensions - knowledge and behaviour amongst students from two different regional universities in South Africa. The objective is to determine whether cultural differences among students have an effect on their ICT security awareness levels. Results obtained suggest that certain cultural factors such as mother tongue, area where you grew up, etc., do have an impact on security awareness levels and should be taken into consideration when planning and developing an information security awareness program. © 2011 IEEE.","cultural factors; ICT security awareness; vocabulary test","Human engineering; Information technology; Cultural difference; Cultural factors; Human dimensions; Information assets; Information security awareness; Security awareness; South Africa; vocabulary test; Security of data"

The RESO approach is suited to VLSI chips. However, the systolic PB multiplier using the RESO approach will unavoidably break the regular structure when detecting errors occurred on feedback lines. The parity checking method for single parity bit can be easily extended to the one with multiple parity bits. However, the drawback of a parity checking method is the dependence on multiplier architectures, and can detect only odd number of errors. To overcome these problems, we present a novel approach, termed self-checking alternating logic (SCAL) approach, to detect errors in a systolic PB multiplier. The proposed SCAL systolic PB multiplier can keep the regular structure and takes less time overhead than existing PB multipliers with CED also. Moreover, the proposed one has the self-testing property which can ensure that there is at least one input can detect the occurred fault.","Alternating logic; Elliptic curve cryptosystem; Error detection; Fault attacks; Finite fields; Information security; Polynomial basis multiplication","Cryptography; Polynomials; Security of data; Alternating logic; Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem; Fault attack; Finite fields; Polynomial basis multiplication; Error detection"

The communication and information security of the mobile commerce is heavily dependent on the public key cryptosystems such as RSA. However, existing public key cryptosystems are not available for the resource constrained devices like smart-phone. Therefore, the new elliptic curve cryptosystem with very low cost as compared to RSA is useful and suggested for mobile commerce. The polynomial basis multiplication is the most important arithmetic operation in the elliptic curve cryptosystem. A new and proved effective cryptanalysis is called fault based cryptanalysis. To protect such type cryptanalysis, the simple way is to redesign cryptosystems with concurrent error detection capability and only output error-free computed results. The polynomial basis multipliers generated by trinomials have advantages of low complexity and easy VLSI implementation. However, no existing polynomial basis multipliers which are generated by trinomials have concurrent error detection capability. Thus, a new polynomial basis multiplier using trinomial with concurrent error detection capability will be presented. As compared to other existing polynomial basis multipliers using general polynomials, the proposed polynomial basis multiplier using trinomial with concurrent error detection capability saves about 40% space complexity.","Concurrent error detection; Elliptic curve cryptosystem; Fault based cryptanalysis; Finite field arithmetic; Polynomial basis multiplier","Commerce; Convolutional codes; Multiplying circuits; Polynomials; Public key cryptography; Security of data; Telephone sets; Concurrent error detection; Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem; Fault based cryptanalysis; Finite field arithmetic; Polynomial basis multiplier; Error detection"

Even though work has been done in ensuring that these programmes include mechanisms for changing behaviour and reinforcing good security practices, there is a lack of work on measuring the effectiveness of such programmes.

PKI systems are today one of the most accepted and used technologies to enable successful implementation of information systems security services such as authentication and confidentiality. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime [2][3]. A forensic investigation of digital evidence is commonly employed as a post-event response to a serious information security incident. In fact, there are many circumstances where an organization may benefit from an ability to gather and preserve digital evidence before an incident occurs. Digital forensic readiness enables an organization to maximize its potential to use digital evidence whilst minimizing the costs of an investigation [7]. The problem that this paper addresses is that there is no Digital Forensic Readiness Framework for PKI systems, thus not enabling an implementation of Digital Forensic Readiness measures to PKI systems. This paper focuses on defining the basic postulates of a Digital Forensic Readiness Framework for PKI systems. The authors investigate a model that can be proposed to accomplish this and also certain policies, guidelines and procedures which can be followed.

A properly implemented Information Security Governance framework should ideally facilitate the implementation of (directing), and compliance to (control), Strategic level management directives. These Strategic level management directives are normally interpreted, disseminated and implemented by means of a series of information security related policies. These policies should ideally be disseminated and implemented from the Strategic management level, through the Tactical level to the Operational level where eventual execution takes place. Control is normally exercised by capturing data at the lowest levels of execution and measuring compliance against the Operational level policies. Through statistical and summarized analyses of the Operational level data into higher levels of extraction, compliance at the Tactical and Strategic levels can be facilitated. This scenario of directing and controlling defines the basis of sound Information Security Governance. Unfortunately, information security policies are normally not disseminated onto the Operational level. As a result, proper controlling is difficult and therefore compliance measurement against all information security policies might be problematic. The objective of this paper is to argue towards a more complete information security policy architecture that will facilitate complete control, and therefore compliance, to ensure sound Information Security Governance. © 2011 IEEE.","direct-control; Information security governance; information security policies; policy architecture","Architecture; Information management; Public policy; Security systems; Strategic planning; Capturing data; Complete control; Complete information; Compliance measurement; direct-control; Information assets; Information security governance; information security policies; Operational level; policy architecture; Strategic level; Strategic management; Security of data"

Among the schemes for making authenticity verification based on information security possible, reversible data hiding has attracted much attention during the past few years. With its characteristics of reversibility, the scheme is required to fulfill the goals from two aspects. On the one hand, at the encoder, the secret information needs to be embedded into the original image by some algorithms, such that the output image will resemble the input one as much as possible. On the other hand, at the decoder, both the secret information and the original image must be correctly extracted and recovered, and they should be identical to their embedding counterparts. Under the requirement of reversibility, for evaluating the performance of the data hiding algorithm, the output image quality, named imperceptibility, and the number of bits for embedding, called capacity, are the two key factors to access the effectiveness of the algorithm. Besides, the size of side information for making decoding possible should also be evaluated. Here we consider using the characteristics of original images for developing our method with better performance. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that has the ability to provide more capacity than conventional algorithms, with similar output image quality after embedding, and comparable side information produced. Simulation results demonstrate the applicability and better performance of our algorithm. © 2011 by the authors.","Capacity; Histogram; Imperceptibility; Quadtree; Reversible data hiding; Side information","Algorithms; Biometric Identification; Computer Security; Computer Simulation; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Records as Topic; algorithm; article; biometry; computer security; computer simulation; human; image processing; information processing; methodology"

Recent work introduced predictive mitigation, a new way to mitigating leakage through timing channels; this mechanism works by predicting timing from past behavior, and then enforcing the predictions. This paper generalizes predictive mitigation to a larger and important class of systems: systems that receive input requests from multiple clients and deliver responses. The new insight is that timing predictions may be a function of any public information, rather than being a function simply of output events. Based on this insight, a more general mechanism and theory of predictive mitigation becomes possible. The result is that bounds on timing leakage can be tightened, achieving asymptotically logarithmic leakage under reasonable assumptions. By applying it to web applications, the generalized predictive mitigation mechanism is shown to be effective in practice. © 2011 ACM.","Information flow; Interactive systems; Mitigation; Timing channels","Forecasting; User interfaces; Information flows; Interactive system; Mitigation; Multiple clients; Output events; Public information; Timing channels; WEB application; Security of data"

Along with the benefits of these technologies come some risks of electronic or cyber attack. There are legitimate concerns about how inadequate information security (cyber security) is affecting electric power systems and other critical infrastructure. As a result of cyber security threats, both governments and industry are putting forth significant effort to improve critical infrastructure security. In the United States, for example, electric power utilities must now follow a set of cyber security standards. Security practices are evolving and improving, and new products and architectures are being developed and applied to counter the ever-increasing sophistication of attacker exploits that attempt to access, inspect, manipulate, and control critical infrastructure control systems. A fundamental question is ""How would we know if our assets are being explored and exploited? "" An attack strategy would likely include a number of initial probes, data collection, tests, and other activities as the adversary develops intelligence and capabilities against a target. To counter this strategy, asset owners need to detect the activities of the intruder. In part, this paper takes the perspective of an engineer investigating a FICTITIOUS incident, using the records and fingerprints an attacker would likely leave behind, which we can use to identify when our systems have been compromised. The paper explains how to answer the question using the many tools readily available in devices and systems in service today. These tools include access logs and syslogs, event reports, sequential events reports, information at adjacent stations, alarms, and precision timing. We also investigate some system design choices that make the process of answering the question easier. Finally, we make some recommendations that not only help answer the question ""How would we know? "" but also make an adversary's job much more difficult. © 2011 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Critical infrastructures; Electric power systems; Engineers; Power transmission; Public works; Relay protection; Security systems; Systems analysis; Access log; Attack strategies; Computing technology; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Data collection; Devices and systems; Electric power utilities; Event report; New product; Power system monitoring; Security Practice; Syslogs; Security of data"

Supported by the need for confidentiality, integrity, availability and other concerns, security features have become standard components of the digital environment which pervade our lives requiring use by novices and experts alike. As security features are exposed to wider cross-sections of the society, it is imperative that these functions are highly usable. This is especially because poor usability in this context typically translates into inadequate application of cybersecurity tools and functionality, thereby ultimately limiting their effectiveness. With this goal of highly usable security in mind, there have been a plethora of studies in the literature focused on identifying security usability problems and proposing guidelines and recommendations to address them. Our paper aims to contribute to the field by consolidating a number of existing design guidelines and defining an initial core list for future reference. Whilst investigating this topic, we take the opportunity to provide an up-to-date review of pertinent cybersecurity usability issues and evaluation techniques applied to date.

The transformed masking method is a typical measure against this attack at the algorithm level. In this method, adding random numbers to intermediate data of encryption masks the correlation between power consumption and confidential information.

Significant risks are associated with handling this kind of information. Providing protection may reduce the risk of the loss and misuse of private information, but it imposes some costs on both the firm and its customers. Nevertheless, customer information security breaches still may occur. They have several distinguishing characteristics: (1) typically it is hard to quantify monetary damages related to them; (2) customer information security breaches may be caused by intentional attacks, as well as through unintentional organizational and customer behaviors; and (3) the frequency of such incidents typically is low, although they can be very costly when they occur. As a result, predictive models and explanatory statistical analysis using historical data have not been effective. We present a profit optimization model for customer information security investments. Our approach is based on value-at-risk methods and operational risk modeling from financial economics. The main results of this work are that we: (1) provide guidance on the trade-offs between risk and return in customer information security investments; (2) define the range of efficient investments in technology-supported risk indemnification for sellers; (3) model how to handle government-dictated levels of investment versus self-regulation of investments in technology; and (4) characterize customer information security investment levels when the firm is able to pass some of its costs on to consumers. We illustrate our theoretical findings with empirical data from the Open Security Foundation, as a means of grounding our analysis and offering the reader intuition for the managerial interpretation of our theory and main results.

To guarantee the reliability and authenticity of records requires a framework of policies, procedures, technologies, and intentional action or intervention by ""trusted custodians"" who have the knowledge required for attesting to and ensuring the continuing authenticity of the records. Records professionals have claimed the role of trusted keepers of the authentic record of our times, but how do they earn that trust? To begin, by acquiring competence. In order to define what kind of education would contribute to qualifying records professionals as competent, it is necessary to identify the components of knowledge they require and the role that society at large expects of them. The responsibilities and challenges presented by managing digital records through time are ones that records professionals should not meet in isolation. In order for records to be able to serve as evidence of actions and events, they must be protected as such. Records-related knowledge requirements are being articulated in the related disciplines of archival science and records management, law, digital forensics, and information assurance and cyber-security. The need for interdisciplinary knowledge to understand and manage the complexities of digital records is being realized in new research alliances that foster the development of knowledge that can support the role of trusted keepers of the authentic record of our times.

According to recent statistics from Gartner, Android's market share in February 2010 [2] is 3.9%, rises [3] to 17.2% in August in the same year, and reaches [4] 22.7% in February 2011, which only falls behind Nokia's by 14.9%. From its skyrocketing growth rate, it can be expected that Google's Android operating system would become the dominate mobile platform. However, high market share comes with problems. For instance, in March 2011, Lookout, an information security company shows DoridDream will make the Android phones become the media of Bot Network [5]. The ever-changing criminal conduct continuously challenges how well the present digital forensics could react. Data acquisition is an important part in mobile phone forensics. As the mobile forensic software becomes more mature and popular, most of them are now facing the same problem where the internal collecting tools must be installed in the mobile phones first so the data collecting could be started in turn. Whether this process is against the concept of protecting the original crime scene in forensics is questionable. A new concept called Live SD is therefore introduced in this work. It utilizes the concept of data recovery to perform physical data acquisition in Android smart phones. This data-acquisition methodology differs from the current ones in most mobile forensics software and can effectively perform the recovery of the deleted data. © 2011 IEEE.","Android; Forensic; Live SD; Recovery; Smart phone","Commerce; Competition; Computer crime; Crime; Mobile phones; Recovery; Security of data; Telecommunication equipment; Telephone; Telephone sets; Acquisition tools; Android; Crime scenes; Criminal conduct; Data collecting; Data recovery; Digital forensic; Forensic; Gartner; Live SD; Market share; Mobile platform; Open-source; Smart phone; Smart phones; Robots"

There is a good security when using the text-based strong password schemes but often memorizing the password is so difficult and users writing them down on a piece of paper or saving inside the computer. There is an alternative solution to the text-based authentication which is the GUA (Graphical User Authentication) or simply Graphical Password based on the fact that humans tend to remember images better. This type of interface provides an easy to create and remember passwords for the users. However, one big issue that is plaguing GUA is shoulder surfing attack that can capture the users mouse clicks and image gallery attack that can change the images of the gallery with physical attack. In this paper, we will propose a new algorithm that using watermarking technique as the solution to solving image gallery attacks and using the random character set generation for each image for resistance to shoulder surfing attack to provide better system security. All the information images in registration phase will be process by copy right protection of watermarking where the login page will check this information for security purposes.

Security has been addressed by isolated security assurance practices, some of which consider risks and mitigations but they do not provide an overview of the overall security state of the system being developed. This paper takes the position that (1) these isolated security assurance practices should be fully integrated and should be embedded in short iterations of risk assessment, treatment and acceptance, providing input for updating security requirements and for security risk management, and that (2) available empirical data from public catalogs and databases should be used as a source of expertise, to leverage past experiences, and therefore reduce, although not eliminate, subjectivity of human judgment.

Risk evaluation and management systems are effective methods for that purpose, and they usually have several sorts of importance, such as construction of secure information system, ascent of personnel's consciousness on the information security, etc. On the final stage of a risk management system, after the risk evaluation was done and some serious risks were clarified, the system usually goes on the process of choosing effective and available mitigation controls against each of risks. For that purpose, a database of mitigation controls with values properly related to a type of clarified risk should be set up beforehand.

The use of communications networks makes these systems potentially vulnerable to cyberattack. Over the past decade, faced with an increase in computer hacking and the recognition of the importance of these services to health and welfare, economic stability, and national security, the United States federal government has been increasingly involved in efforts to assist utilities in improving their security posture. Smart grid has become synonymous with asynchronous, nonmission-critical information exchange applications. Smart grid infrastructure describes the existing, yet largely unrecognized, mission-critical control applications that enable generation and delivery of power. Smart grid infrastructure applications require deterministic and synchronous message exchange, including automation and teleprotection. Today, utilities are faced with a confusing array of cybersecurity guidance, standards, and regulatory requirements. Electric utilities operating bulk power system assets must comply with eight NERC (North American Electric Reliability Corporation) CIP (Critical Infrastructure Protection) standards that are in the process of being revised. Federal entities are required by the FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002) to comply with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standards. Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Congress gave NIST the task of developing a framework of interoperability and cybersecurity for smart grid applications. To date, the framework has been primarily focused on smart grid information exchange applications that use asynchronous data flow, including metering, demand response, and the near realtime elements of substation and distribution automation. These automation elements and other smart grid infrastructure applications that require deterministic synchronous data exchange, including teleprotection and synchrophasor state measurement, remain a future endeavor. This paper discusses various cybersecurity requirements and presents a clear picture of work being done by NIST to explain what is required and recommended and what utilities should expect to see in the near future as NERC and NIST work continues. © 2011 IEEE.","","Automation; Computer crime; Critical infrastructures; Electric utilities; Engineers; Information dissemination; Personal computing; Relay protection; SCADA systems; Security of data; Standards; Asynchronous data; Bulk power systems; Communications networks; Computer hacking; Control applications; Critical infrastructure protection; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Demand response; Distribution automation; Economic stability; Electric power; Electric reliability; Energy independence and security act of 2007; Essential services; Federal governments; Information exchanges; Information security managements; Message exchange; Monitoring system; National Institute of Standards and Technology; National security; North American; Oil and gas; Real time; Regulatory requirements; Smart grid; State measurements; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Synchronous data exchange; Synchrophasors; Teleprotection; Smart power grids"

Though a number of bio-crypto algorithms have been proposed, they have limited practical applicability because they lack of cancelability. Since biometrics are immutable, the users whose biometrics are stolen cannot use bio-crypto systems anymore. Cancelable biometric schemes are of cancelability; however, they are difficult to compromise the conflicts between the security and performance. By embedded a novel cancelable palmprint template, namely two dimensional (2D) Palmprint Phasor, the proposed palmprint cryptosystem overcomes the lack of cancelability in existing biometric cryptosystems. Besides, the authentication performance is enhanced when users have different tokens/keys. Furthermore, we develop a novel dual-key-binding cancelable palmprint cryptosystem to enhance the security and privacy of palmprint biometric. 2D Palmprint Phasor template is scrambled by the scrambling transformation based on the chaotic sequence that is generated by both the users token/key and strong key extracted from palmprint. Dual-key-binding scrambling not only has more robustness to resist against chosen plain text attack, but also enhances the secure requirement of non-invertibility. 2D Palmprint Phasor algorithm and dual-key-binding scrambling both increase the difficulty of adversarys statistical analysis. The experimental results and security analysis confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To detect these system's abnormal activities or misuse by malicious attackers, intrusion detection system (IDS) is usually adopted. Even though detection algorithms and their performance are improved, IDS still consume system resources not ignorable. For providing high performance computing environment, lightweight anomaly detection method is needed today. In this paper, we propose self-similarity measures for lightweight IDS. For normal systems, a regular and periodic self-similarity can be observed in a system's internal activities such as system calls and process status. On the other hand, outliers occur when an anomalous attack happens, and then the system's self-similarity cannot be maintained. Therefore monitoring the changes of a system's self-similarity can be used to detect the system's anomalies. From this viewpoint, we developed a new measure based on cosine similarity and found the optimal time interval for estimating the self-similarity of a given system. As a result, we can detect abnormal activities using only a few resources. © 2011 International Information Institute.","Anomaly detection; Information security; Intrusion detection; Lightweight; Self-similarity",""

In the traditional trust evaluation methods, the fake recommendation and the joint cheat recommendation of malicious customers can not be avoided, so the objectivity and creditability of the evaluation results are affected. In order to solve these problems, a novel reputation reporting mechanism based on cloud model and gray system theory is proposed in this paper. In this mechanism, the evaluation data provided by the customer is collected using the cloud model firstly, then the data is handled using the gray system theory, and the trust degree of the corresponding evaluated entity is obtained.

Audio steganography is the science of hiding some secret text or audio information in a host message. The host message before steganography and stego message after steganography have the same characteristics. Least Significant Bit (LSB) modification technique is the most simple and efficient technique used for audio steganography. The conventional LSB modification technique is vulnerable to steganalysis. This paper proposes two ways to improve the conventional LSB modification technique. The first way is to randomize bit number of host message used for embedding secret message while the second way is to randomize sample number containing next secret message bit. The improvised proposed technique works against steganalysis and decreases the probability of secret message being extracted by an intruder. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 256 bits key length is used to secure secret message in case the steganography technique breaks. Proposed technique has been tested successfully on a. wav file at a sampling frequency of 8000 samples/second with each sample containing 8 bits. © 2011 IEEE.","AES-256; Audio Steganography; Information Security; LSB Modification Steganography; Secret Information Transmission; Steganalysis; Steganography","Data privacy; Information technology; Internet; Telecommunication networks; AES-256; Audio steganography; LSB Modification Steganography; Secret information; Steganalysis; Steganography"

Today, centuries later, in the growing field of electronic commerce (e-commerce) the challenges of attracting, knowing, and retaining satisfied customers within the online realm, dubbed e-satisfaction, are even more daunting. This challenge of satisfying online customers is felt in the mainstream business-to-consumer e-commerce realm. Though the Web allows for an unprecedented level of choice, where consumers now have more control over the consumption of online content when compared with traditional media, the customers' opinions as to what makes them satisfied with Websites and the online purchasing process is rarely sought. In noting that the focus of control has switched from sellers to buyers some businesses are becoming more like small niche players, building personalized experiences, improving customer service, and customizing interfaces (Novak and Hoffman & Yung, 2000). On the other hand, the Web-based marketing efforts by some organizations have remained basically ""brochure ware"" concepts using the mentality that as long as there is a Website, customers will come and do business. However, with the demands of the online world, where business function takes precedence over customer values, many online businesses have fallen short in their consumer-focused efforts (Tierney 2000), (Weber and Roehl 1999).In this article the findings regarding the empirical data of the survey will be presented.

Information Security Governance (ISG) provides enterprises with means of dealing with the security of their information assets in a comprehensive manner, involving every stakeholder through the whole governance and management processes. Boards of Public Entities cannot remain unaware of this development and should make efforts to include ISG in their business processes. Realizing this relevant role, scientific literature contains a variety of proposals which define different frameworks to foster ISG inside any corporation. In order to facilitate the adoption of any of them by the public sector, this paper compiles existing approaches, highlighting the main contributions and characteristics of each one. Senior executives and security managers may need support on their decisions about adopting one of these frameworks, so a comparative analysis is performed. Although some comparative reviews are found in literature, they lack a systematic and repeatable methodology, ignore recently published contributions or focus on specific areas, making results biased and inappropriate for general use in corporations and the public sector. This paper tries to guarantee an objective comparison through a set of comparative criteria that have been defined and applied to every proposal, so that strengths and weaknesses of each one can be pointed out. These criteria have been selected from a deep analysis of existing ISG papers, including both governance and management aspects. As results show, each proposal focuses on different aspects of ISG giving priority to some of the defined criteria, and none of them covers the entire required spectrum. Most of the selected frameworks can be used by any public organization as a starting point towards integrating security into their processes, but this paper helps managers to be aware of their limitations and the gaps which need to be covered in order to achieve a complete integration. Consequently, more investigation is needed to fulfill detected gaps and define an ISG framework that organizations can rely on, and which offers security guarantees of covering every information asset of the company. Public sector's idiosyncrasy must be taken into account in this development, resulting in a general framework eligible for adoption by both public and private companies.","Comparative analysis; Governance framework; Information security governance; Review; Security governance","Government data processing; Industry; Managers; Reviews; Business Process; Comparative analysis; Governance framework; Information assets; Information security governance; Integrating security; Management process; Private companies; Public entities; Public organizations; Public sector; Scientific literature; Security awareness; Security governance; Security manager; Specific areas; Security of data"

Criminal acts committed in networks with the use of networks and against networks, reach beyond national borders. Since the 1990s, when the United Nations (UN) recognized computer violation as a form of transborder crime, profits originating in computer crime have surpassed those from drug trade. Organized crime is adapting to the environment of advanced technology, using thousands of computer networks to commit crimes on a global scale. Openness and anonymity is the strength of the Internet, but remains at the same time its greatest weakness. Among the network users, the group which aims at undesired or even unlawful accessing, distributing and exchanging information is growing. Technical solutions in information security have to be supported by demands to follow the rules of relevant procedures - assured through legal state obligations and sanctions in case of violation of such rules. To translate the language used by modern technology into proper legal language and catching behaviour seemingly unimportant or of minor consequence, but causing major damage, turned out to be most difficult. It is hence of great significance to adopt laws covering as much as possible of cyberspace behaviour. One of the most effective methods of securing digital information is concealing it with the use of cryptography. It is true that communication using concealed information protects privacy and secrecy of mails to a high degree, but renders at the same time considerably more difficult accessing to information in cases when common good demands breaking such secrecy. Such procedures are most often carefully described and rigorously regulated by law since they interfere with the sensitive question of privacy of citizens. There is nevertheless still a need to specify i.a. how to use available cryptographic tools in order to access content of cryptographically concealed transmission without having access to the cryptographic keys. All efforts to exercise control over the Internet create controversy, raising questions about freedom of speech, stirring up protests about censorship, calling in question the intrusion of state authorities upon the private sphere of network users. At the same time, more countries introduce legal instruments of decree and prohibition in order to prevent law violation, something the Internet facilitates or even makes possible. In times of terrorism threats, efforts are intensified aiming at introducing measures which allow certain degree of control over the virtual space. It certainly requires a balance between the necessity of security regarding citizens and the need to guarantee their rights.","Anonymity; Computer network; Cryptography; Cybercrime; Legal interception; Unauthorized access","Computer crime; Computer networks; Cryptography; Internet; Profitability; Security of data; Advanced technology; Anonymity; Criminal acts; Cryptographic key; Cybercrime; Cyberspaces; Degree of control; Digital information; Exercise control; Freedom of speech; Global scale; Information warfare; Law violation; Legal protection; Modern technologies; Network users; Sensitive questions; Technical solutions; Unauthorized access; United Nations; Virtual spaces; Crime"

Based on an extensive literature review, we identified perceived trustworthiness of the seller and perceived product uncertainty as major determinants, and we theorize that product type, product price, and product description are antecedents of product uncertainty. In our theoretical framework, we model perceived trustworthiness of the seller and perceived product uncertainty as independent variables, which are hypothesized to predict the dependent variable, namely online payment method choice (credit card, debit card, or cash on delivery). Moreover, we define payment method characteristics (e.g., information security) and buyer characteristics (e.g., trust propensity, online shopping experience) as control variables. Also, we describe a laboratory experiment in which we test our theoretical framework. Considering the recent calls for the use of neurobiological and physiological approaches to advance information systems (IS) theorizing (see, for example, www.NeuroIS.org), we suggest using eye-tracking data to complement traditional data sources, particularly those captured through survey research. Specifically, we propose that eye- tracking data can be used to measure product uncertainty, a major predictor of online payment method choice, which is associated with unconscious and automatic informationprocessing that cannot be articulated easily through self-reports. © (2011) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","Eye-tracking; Neurois; Online payment method choice; Trust; Uncertainty","Information systems; Security of data; Uncertainty analysis; Eye-tracking; NeuroIS; On-line payment; Trust; Uncertainty; Electronic commerce"

The Speed Capture Station is based on a solution being used in Sweden since 2005 to capture photo, fingerprints and signature for the national passport. In Sweden, the terminal is completely operated by an official, whereas the solution for Germany is a self-service terminal being used by the applicant independently, while the official is just retrieving the captured data during the application process. During the design and the development of the self-service terminal several aspects had to be considered. Among these were the compliance with national regulations like Technical Guidelines by the Federal Office for Information Security and the German Data Privacy Act, but also the requirement to provide an interface allowing an easy integration of the data retrieval into the software in use at the identity card and passport authorities. In this paper the main requirements, their implications and the related solutions which were implemented in the Speed Capture Station are described, followed by a report about the first pilot operation of the terminal during the second half of 2010 in the city of Monheim am Rhein.

The proposed algorithm, we named Grid Secure Storage System (GS3), has been implemented on top of the Grid File Access Library (GFAL) of the gLite middleware, in order to provide a file system service with cryptography capability and POSIX interface. The choice of implementing GS3 as a file system allows to protect also the file system structure, and moreover to overcome the well-known problem of file rewriting in gLite/GFAL environments.

Many threats cannot be countered only with sophisticated technical equipment. Instead, the attitudes and actions of employees gain significance each day, be the threat an urge to leak company confidential documents to Wikileaks or to competitors, or willingness to help a ""colleague"" with an unconventional request. Information security culture is a concept widely accepted in the field of information security research. It refers to the dominant understanding of how information security principles are manifested in the daily operations of a company. The culture implies what kind of behaviour of the employees is acceptable and encouraged. Literature about information security almost non-exceptionally uses the word security. However, in the field of organizational safety culture, the word security has little use. What is different? Is preventing human or material casualties really fundamentally different from preventing information casualties? This paper is triggered by the curiosity of how different literature streams discuss culture, be it called safety culture or security culture. Also the differences in approaches to security and safety are analysed. The term safety includes both the perspective of an object being protected from threats and the perspective of that object not causing threats. The term security includes only the perspective of an object being protected from threats. It is interesting to note, that both the words safety and security appear in the definitions for the term security. In information security the focus is for many organizations on the threats that come from outside the organization. This seems to justify the use of the word security. However, in many cases the biggest threats to the information of an organization come from inside the organization. Also, many organizations state that the information of customers is the most valuable to them and compromising customer information would not only harm the organization itself, but also its stakeholders. This would justify the use of the word safety in connection with information. This paper presents a literature review. The outcome of this paper is an understanding of the differences and similarities of the concepts under stydy. Discussion on the meaning of information security culture and implications to companies are presented.","Concept analysis; Information security; Information security culture; Meanings; Safety; Security","Accident prevention; Industry; Societies and institutions; Concept analysis; Customer information; Information safety; Literature reviews; Material casualty; Meanings; Organizational safety culture; Safety culture; Security; Technical equipments; Security of data"

In today's highly interconnected world, with a proliferation of camera equipped cell phones, preventing data loss by a determined insider, possibly in collusion with other insiders is impossible. However, if as multiple analyses of data breaches show, the majority of data breaches (as high as 80% of all data breaches) occur from end-user error then the incidence and resulting loss from data breaches can be significantly reduced. This paper presents a method for organizing the end-user computing (EUC) environment to prevent inadvertent data leakage and, thus, improve information security.","Data loss prevention; End-user computing environment; Information security; Insider threats","Computer systems; Cell phone; Cloud computing environments; Data leakage; Data Sharing; End user computing; End users; Enterprise security; Insider Threat; Security of data"

In response, the President, legislators, experts, and others have characterized cybersecurity as a pressing national security issue. Like other national security challenges in the post-9/11 era, the cyber threat is multi-faceted and lacks clearly delineated boundaries. Some cyber attackers operate through foreign nations' military or intelligence-gathering operations, whereas others have connections to terrorist groups or operate as individuals. Some cyber threats might be viewed as international or domestic criminal enterprises. In January 2008, the Bush Administration established the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (the CNCI) by a classified joint presidential directive. The CNCI establishes a multi- pronged approach the federal government is to take in identifying current and emerging cyber threats, shoring up current and future telecommunications and cyber vulnerabilities, and responding to or proactively addressing entities that wish to steal or manipulate protected data on secure federal systems. On February 9, 2009, President Obama initiated a 60-day interagency cybersecurity review to develop a strategic framework to ensure the CNCI is being appropriately integrated, resourced, and coordinated with Congress and the private sector. In response to the CNCI and other proposals, questions have emerged regarding: (1) the adequacy of existing legal authorities-statutory or constitutional-for responding to cyber threats; and (2) the appropriate roles for the executive and legislative branches in addressing cybersecurity. The new and emerging nature of cyber threats complicates these questions. Although existing statutory provisions might authorize some modest actions, inherent constitutional powers currently provide the most plausible legal basis for many potential executive responses to national security related cyber incidences. Given that cyber threats originate from various sources, it is difficult to determine whether actions to prevent cyber attacks fit within the traditional scope of executive power to conduct war and foreign affairs. Nonetheless, under the Supreme Court jurisprudence, it appears that the President is not prevented from taking action in the cybersecurity arena, at least until Congress takes further action. Regardless, Congress has a continuing oversight and appropriations role. In addition, potential government responses could be limited by individuals' constitutional rights or international laws of war. This report discusses the legal issues and addresses policy considerations related to the CNCI. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

The results suggest that sharing is promoted by trust, risk and uncertainty, knowledge management and relationship factors. Investigators shared information partly to overcome tensions with other business areas and to ameliorate operational risk perceptions.

The classification system - designating information, according to prescribed criteria and procedures, protected in accordance with one of three levels of sensitivity, based on the amount of harm to the national security that would result from its disclosure - attained a presidential character in 1940 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued the initial executive order prescribing these information security arrangements. Refinements in the creation, management, and declassification of national security information followed over the succeeding decades, and continue today. In many regards, these developments represent attempts to narrow the bases and discretion for assigning official secrecy to executive branch documents and materials. Limiting the quantity of security classified information has been thought to be desirable for a variety of important reasons: (1) promoting an informed citizenry, (2) effectuating accountability for government policies and practices, (3) realizing oversight of government operations, and (4) achieving efficiency and economy in government management.Because security classification, however, was not possible for some kinds of information deemed in some quarters to be ""sensitive,"" other kinds of designations or markings came to be applied to alert federal employees regarding its privileged or potentially harmful character. Sometimes these markings derived from statutory provisions requiring the protection of a type of information; others were administratively authorized with little detail about their use.In the current environment, still affected by the long shadow of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, several issues have arisen regarding security classified and controlled information. Volume is a concern: 8 million new classification actions in 2001 jumped to 14 million new actions in 2005, while the quantity of declassified pages dropped from 100 million in 2001 to 29 million in 2005. Expense is vexing: $4.5 billion spent on classification in 2001 increased to $7.1 billion in 2004, while declassification costs fell from $232 million in 2001 to $48.3 million in 2004, according to annual reports by the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Some agencies were recently discovered to be withdrawing archived records from public access and reclassifying them. Critically evaluating this activity, ISOO has indicated that the federal government needs to apply a more integrated approach among the classifying agencies. The force of, and authority for, information control markings, other than security classification labels, have come under congressional scrutiny, prompting concerns about their number, variety, lack of underlying managerial regimes, and effects. Among those effects, contend the Government Accountability Office and the manager of the Information Sharing Environment for the intelligence community, is the obstruction of information sharing across the federal government and with state and local governments. These and related matters, including remedial legislation (H.R. 984, H.R. 4806), are examined in this chapter.Prescribed in various ways, federal policies may require the protection of, or provide a privileged status for, certain kinds of information. For the legislative branch, for example, the Constitution, in Article I, Section 5, specifies that each house of Congress ""shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy."" In the next section of the article, a privileged status for certain remarks of Members is established when the Constitution indicates that ""for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place."" Within the executive branch, it seems likely that one of the earliest-felt needs for secrecy concernedpreparations and plans for the defense of the country. Following long-standing military practice, General George Washington and other officers in the Continental Army, seeking to ensure the protection of information, had written ""Secret"" or ""Confidential"" on strategic communiques to each other in the field and to headquarters. There was no immediate formalization of this practice by the new federal government, but it was from these roots that security classification would emerge. That history is briefly reviewed in the next section of this chapter.The application of security classification subsequently came to be regulated through a narrowing of the bases and discretion for assigning official secrecy to executive branch materials. Due to that and other information management developments, new kinds of designations or markings came to be used to alert federal employees about the privileged status or sensitive content of a record or document. Sometimes these markings derived from statutory provisions requiring the protection of a type of information; many others were administratively created, but lacked detailed management regimes. Early congressional experience with these other markings is examined, providing a background for considering some of the current issues they raise. Finally, the report considers some long-standing difficulties attending the management of security classified information - controlling the volume of such material and attendant costs. It looks, as well, at recent efforts by some agencies to withdraw archived records from public access and reclassify them, activity which the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) critically evaluated and, as a reform for the underlying problem, suggested a more integrated approach among the classifying agencies. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Security of webmails carrying sensitive commercial or corporate information is an important requirement today. A comprehensive solution is expected to cover confidentiality and integrity requirements during transit as well as authentication of the origin of webmails. Although some e-mail security solutions such as PGP, S/MIME, SMS and solution from Freenigma are currently available, most of them are tailored for handling e-mail sent or received by mail clients such as the Outlook Express or Eudora and they cannot handle webmails sent or received by browsers. The Freenigma solution handles a few specific webmail services but does not provide a generic solution. The main challenge in developing a security solution for webmails lies in building a parser to extract e-mail header details and mail body from a HTTP message, that can work with all webmail services.

Pervasive communication and computer systems intend to provide access to information and services anytime and anywhere, demanding cryptographic systems more practical and that consider the characteristics of emerging network paradigms, such as wireless communication, device constraints and mobility. Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC) is an asymmetric key cryptographic technology that employs as user's public key any unique information related to the identity of the user. IBC efficiently manages keying material and provides an easy way to issue a pair of keys applying user information. However, it assumes the existence of a Trusted Third Party (TTP), called Private Key Generator (PKG), which is responsible for generating the corresponding user private key. Relying on a TTP and using an identity as the base of the scheme result in different weaknesses on the system, as the inherent key escrow problem. This chapter investigates those weaknesses, and it points out the stat-of-the-art of proposed solutions to avoid them.

Moreover, an instructor can create a subsequent advanced course where students can reinforce and expand secure coding practices as well as learn security principles. However, most visual programming books that are suitable as textbooks usually do not deal with security issues. Even if they do, minimal discussion is usually included, even being without connection to security principles. Therefore, in order to imbed security into a visual programming course, instructors are required to spend enormous time in preparation. In this paper, we set out to provide a guideline for embedding security into a visual programming course.

However, there have been obstacles in defining the citizens who truly deserve the subsidies as well as a need to monitor the allocation of funds more closely, and enhance the level of implementation of the process. The smart family card would replace the traditional ration book, which was filled out by hand at the grocery store registered as an outlet for rations and signed by the ration book holder. The system was no longer efficient enough to accommodate the growing population, and documentation was not accurately updated to ensure that subsidized goods were reaching targeted citizens. The new system allowed the registered outlet only replacing goods that have already been claimed by smart card, with all transactions being electronically monitored and documented, thus eliminating waste or illegal transactions. The electronic system for the family card was designed to provide citizens with the services offered by the government; such as pensions and medical insurance as well as subsidized goods or their monetary equivalent. The smart cards can be used at grocery stores authorized to sell subsidized goods as well as at ATM machines. The family card project has provided a comprehensive database of Egyptian families which can be used by decision makers in defining the families in need, as well as tracing consumption levels and patterns across the country. The implementation has resulted in over US$1,217 Million gross till now in savings through controlling distribution of subsidies. The system takes into consideration the need for constant updates to guarantee the accuracy of information. After in-depth study and analysis it was found to be financially feasible to outsource the project to a private sector company, who would be responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of the technology related to the project as well as applying high level international standards for data and process security.In this research, Family Card System has been presented.

Building on the organizational behavior, psychology and criminology literatures, in this paper, we introduce different socio-behavioral control mechanisms to mitigate insider threats to information security. These mechanisms include employees' integration and commitment to their job and organization, deterrence measures, management of work related stress, awareness of security issues, and motivation of employees. These socio-behavioral mechanisms are also accompanied by technical aspects such as user interface of security tools and technology-based controls.

A good quality random number generator is an asset for applications like encryption, randomized designs and network and information security. Various mathematical models have been developed in the past to improve the quality of random numbers. It can be construed that in general to obtain random numbers of excellent quality, a complex mathematical model has to be used which can be a performance bottleneck. In this work, we propose a novel technique to implement a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) using sources of uncertainty found within Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) together with histogram equalization to obtain maximum entropy. We evaluate the random numbers generated by our approach using four tests. First, we measure the correlation values between two sequences of random numbers, second, we measure the entropy values, third, we use watermarking, an application used in network security and finally we use Monte Carlo analysis for pi-value calculation. Based on these quality measurements, our method has achieved better results than popular random number generators compared in this work. Furthermore, this approach is a massively scalable solution ideal for high performance computing implementations. © 2011 IEEE.","Exact histogram equalization; Graphics processing units (GPUs); Histogram equalization; True random numbers (TRNG)","Computer software selection and evaluation; Cryptography; Entropy; Graphic methods; Mathematical models; Network security; Number theory; Program processors; Clinical trial; Correlation value; Entropy value; Graphics processing units; High performance computing; Histogram equalizations; Maximum entropy; Monte carlo analysis; Novel techniques; Performance bottlenecks; Quality measurements; Random number generators; Random Numbers; Randomized design; Scalable solution; Sources of uncertainty; Random number generation"

We argue that information security is, in general, viewed from a technological and means-end oriented perspective. Our approach can be seen as an initial attempt to approach information security in a broader, more holistic, sense. For this purpose, we approach information security from a health professional's perspective. An instrument, The Information Security Employee's Evaluation (ISEE), is presented to evaluate and discuss information security with health professionals. The ISEE instrument consists of seven dimensions: priority, responsibility, incident handling, functionality, communication, supervision and training and education. The ISEE instrument can be used to better understand health professional's perception, needs and problems when dealing with information security in practice. Following the design science approach, the ISEE instrument was validated within a focus group of security experts and pilot tested as workshops across five hospital departments in two medical centers. Although the ISEE instrument has by no means the comprehensiveness of existing security standards, we do argue that the instrument can provide valuable insights for both practitioners and research communities. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Evaluation; Human perspective; Information security","Biomedical engineering; Design; Health; Hospitals; Instruments; Design science; Evaluation; Health professionals; Human perspectives; Research communities; Security experts; Security standards; Training and education; Security of data"

However, there are still several issues regarding large-scale deployment of biometrics in real-world situations that need to be resolved before biometrics can be incorporated together. One of these issues is the occurrence of high training time while enrolling a large amount of people into the system. Hence, in this chapter, the authors present the training architecture for an audio visual system for large scale people recognition over internet protocol. In the proposed architecture, a selection criteria divider unit is used to decompose the large scale people or population into smaller groups whereby each group is trained subsequently. As the input dimensions of each group is reduced compared to the original data size, the proposed structure greatly reduces the overall training time required. To combine the scores from all groups, a two-level fusion based on weighted sum rule and max rule is also proposed in this chapter. The implementation results of the proposed system show a great reduction in training time compared to a similar system trained by conventional means without any compromise on the performance of the system. In addition to the proposal of a scalable training architecture for large-scale people recognition based on audio visual data, a literature review of available audio visual speaker recognition systems and large-scale population training architectures are also presented in this chapter. © 2012, IGI Global.","",""

The inquiry was organized around the themes discipline and agility, culture, and security processes in order to get an in-depth understanding of the complex relationship between security management, referred to as discipline, and security in use, referred to as agility. Findings The paper shows that security behaviour can be shaped by discipline and agility and that both can exist collectively if organizations consider the constitutional and existential aspects of information security (IS) management. Practical implications This research makes a pivotal stand for the issue how security behaviours narrate a broad picture to enhance IS management. In particular, this will improve design of IS training and awareness programs. Originality/value This research is relevant to IS management in organizations, particularly as behavioural and cultural aspects are becoming increasingly significant for maintaining and also designing systemic IS management. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

VANETs, though special cases of MANETs, have distinct characteristics: high mobility with limitation of road topology, rapidly changing network topology, unbounded network size, and time-sensitive data exchange, to name only a few. These unique characteristics, together with the fact that many VANET applications are safety-related, make security provisioning in VANETs a challenging while indispensable task. In this chapter, we systematically investigate the security provisioning issues of VANETs, to give a rather complete understanding on the requirements, challenges, potential solutions, open issues, and the future research directions from different perspectives. Based on the analysis of threat models and different applications requirements, we categorize the VANET security requirements into three major classes (the information security, the data security, and the trust management), along with considerations about network performance constraints. In-depth investigations of these security provisioning issues and future research directions are presented. A security provisioning framework that enables interactions of different security provisioning modules is also proposed. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

For providing an optimal solution an optimization task with two goals have to be solved - to minimize needed resources and to maximize achievable security. The computational complexity of the optimization task is very high. In previous work a matrix based security model and an optimization framework based on the Pareto optimality and the discrete dynamic programming method has been used. But that solution has a quite important imperfection - there was required independence between security activity areas. That is not appropriate for IT security, as this solution does not follow the quite important principle in IT security - security is like a chain that is only as strong as the weakest link of layered security or defence in depth. The evolutionary optimization, as an alternative optimization tool, removed the independence restriction of the matrix based security model and the dynamic optimization method, but the first implementation of it was slightly slower than the other methods. For improving the performance of the evolutionary optimization we have performed a meta-level optimization of parameters of the algorithm and as a result the speed of optimization is comparable to other optimization techniques. As the evolutionary optimization is independent for all possible budget levels it lead to possibility to use a graph based security model. The graph based security model is a new and dynamical framework for security management. This paper presents how implementation of an evolutionary optimization technique removed the restrictions of independence of security measures and lead to implementation of an efficient graph based security model.","Evolutionary optimization; Graded security model; Information security metrics","Evolutionary algorithms; Graphic methods; Industrial management; Security of data; Security systems; Cost-efficient; Cyber security; Discrete dynamics; Dynamic optimization; Evolutionary optimizations; Graph-based; IT security; Layered security; Meta-level optimization; Optimal selection; Optimal solutions; Optimization framework; Optimization task; Optimization techniques; Optimization tools; Pareto-optimality; Security activities; Security goals; Security management; Security measure; Security model; Optimization"

Biometrics could be employed as the primary means for authentication, called user identification, as well as a complementary (secondary) method for authentication, known as user verification. Biometric traits that cannot be easily forged and are supposedly unique for each user can form the basis of techniques for user identification. Biometric traits that need not be unique for each user; but, can be used to validate whether a user is whom he/she claims to be form the basis for user verification techniques.

In this paper we study such value conflicts and their implications on IS management and practice. Shein's (1999) model of organizational culture is used as a tool supporting analysis of our empirical data. We found that value conflicts exists between different security cultures within the same organization and that users anchor their values related to IS in their professional values. Thus our empirical results highlight value conflicts as an important factor to take into account when security culture is developed in an organization. Moreover, we found Shein's model as a useful tool for analysis of value conflicts between different subcultures in an organization.","Information Security; Security culture; Shein's model; Value conflicts","Information systems; Empirical data; Organizational cultures; Tool supporting; Value conflicts; Security of data"

Unfortunately, even though many mobile devices approach personal computers in functionality, most mobile users are not aware of the degree of security threats in the mobile environment. ""As mobile Internet usage continues its rapid growth, cyber criminals are expected to pay more attention to this sector"" (Siciliano, 2010, p. 1). There are several security threats related to mobile devices. The most common security threat associated with mobile devices is their propensity to become lost, stolen, or misplaced. Social Engineering is a method used by cybercriminals to trick users into providing personal or financial information, or downloading malicious software. One common social engineering attack against mobile devices involves attempts to collect personal, credit card, and banking information from users. Malware is short for malicious software and refers to a collection of malevolent software tools designed to attack the pillars of information security: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authentication. Although malicious software and security attacks can occur in a number of ways such as SMS text messaging, the primary mode of infection is through the download of mobile applications such as games. Unfortunately, all mobile devices and all mobile operating systems are subject to mobile malware attacks. As a result, malware has become a prevalent threat to mobile devices. © 2012, IGI Global.","",""

Training that provides security arguments and promotes systematic cognitive processing has been shown to be an effective mechanism for improving secure behavior. Training by providing security cues, on the other hand, has been criticized as having a short-lived and unpredictable influence on secure behavior. This paper challenges this criticism by explaining how security cues influence secure behavior and when they are more effective in influencing secure behavior than security arguments. We hypothesize the different theoretical mechanisms through which security arguments and security cues influence secure behavior. We further hypothesize that when users' attitude toward behaving secure is poor, security arguments should be used. However, when users' attitude toward behaving secure is positive, security cues should be used.

Cryptography, the branch of security is the technique of secret writing. Age old traditional cryptographic techniques require complex encryption and decryption algorithms for encoding and decoding the original information. Visual cryptography is a novel technique which assures information security with the help of a simple process unlike the computationally complex algorithms used in traditional cryptography. Visual cryptography is an image encrypting technique, which allows visual information (pictures, text, etc) to be encrypted in such a way that their decryption can be performed by the human visual system, without involvement of mathematical complexity. The advances in technology are demanding more robust and less complex security schemes. This paper proposes a new image hiding and sharing scheme. Secret sharing refers to a method for distributing a secret amongst a group of participants, each of which is allocated a share of the secret. Secret sharing is concerned with the problem of how to handle the distribution of shares among parties. This paper handles this issue and also assures that only pre-designated sub-collections of individuals are able to view the secret by collectively combining their shares of the secret. The secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient proposition of shares are combined together. Individual shares are of no use on their own.

Access control is the key to all aspects of security, and it is a point that should be well considered by any security team. A common misconception about access control is that is begins and ends with locked doors, and this is sadly mistaken. Access control limits access to specific area of buildings, which house network servers, offices, terminals, and a host of other devices and data that must be protected. PKI would be useful to the Security Professional, as it creates a Web of Trust between all users on the network, and when that trust is violated, only then does the security team have to jump into action. This technique is being used within the medical field and in many research and development departments across the United States, but is not currently in place in the typical office environment. This method would enhance the overall security of a given office network, provide the security teams with an easier network to maintain, and speed up the flow of data within the office environment.

ISG and the impact of poor security incident management have attracted much attention in the literature but unfortunately there is little empirical evidence regarding the explicit link between ISG and its effectiveness in terms of reducing negative impacts on business objectives from security incidents. Consequently, little exploration of ISG factors and their impact on the above mentioned measure of effectiveness exists. Further, to direct endeavors the crucial question is if there exist any differences in how effective these factors are in attaining this target. Currently, there is a lack in research considering this question. The research presented in this article explores the ISG domain further by empirically examine 30 ISG factors and their ability of reducing negative impacts on business objectives from security incidents. Data has been collected by surveying ISG experts. Ten factors were identified to have significant different means in relation to other factors according to a one-way ANOVA analysis that was conducted. The results give an indication on what ISG factors that have an effect, providing both support for further academic research and also decision support for implementing ISG.","Expert survey; Information Security Governance; Information security governance factors","Decision support systems; Factor analysis; Information systems; Research; Security of data; Surveys; Academic research; Business objectives; Decision supports; Empirical evidence; Expert opinion; Expert survey; Exploratory studies; Information resource; Information security governance; Measure of effectiveness; One-way anova; Optimized use; Security incident; Strategic direction; Strategic level; Information management"

Mobile devices are under attack from various threats. These threats can act individually or in combinations (blended threats). The risk is greatest, when a user accesses corporate information systems via mobile devices and public networks. Users are becoming more aware of the importance of information security. Providers of security software have already perceived the need to implement control over the transfer of data from the Internet to mobile devices. Users are usually the weakest link in information security. Each corporation with its own information system should implement internal safety standards and regulate the use of mobile devices, software, protocols and public networks.

The Dams Sector Roadmap to Secure Control Systems effectively describes a concise plan and provides strategic direction for voluntarily improving the cybersecurity posture of control systems within the Dams Sector, including specified goals and milestones on which to focus efforts and activities, while addressing the sector's most urgent challenges. An effective implementation of these concepts is represented by the corporate strategy developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to identify short-, mid-, and long-term solutions to comply with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards. USACE has committed to a program of voluntary compliance to meet all applicable NERC reliability standards within resources and operating constraints. Major challenges include the existence of a wide variety of industrial control systems across the different USACE Divisions and Districts. These systems range from those designed and installed over 20 years ago, which are highly dependent on human interaction, to newer, more sophisticated systems. This paper describes the development of the Army Corps of Engineers Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Program (ACE-CME), in collaboration with the USACE Critical Infrastructure Protection and Resilience (CIPR) Program, to monitor and assess current and future requirements.

Design/methodology/approach Both qualitative comparisons of functionality and quantitative comparisons of false positives and false negatives are made for seven different scanners. The quantitative assessment includes data from both authenticated and unauthenticated scans. Experiments were conducted on a computer network of 28 hosts with various operating systems, services and vulnerabilities. This network was set up by a team of security researchers and professionals. Findings The data collected in this study show that authenticated vulnerability scanning is usable. However, automated scanning is not able to accurately identify all vulnerabilities present in computer networks. Also, scans of hosts running Windows are more accurate than scans of hosts running Linux. Research limitations/implications This paper focuses on the direct output of automated scans with respect to the vulnerabilities they identify. Areas such as how to interpret the results assessed by each scanner (e.g. regarding remediation guidelines) or aggregating information about individual vulnerabilities into risk measures are out of scope. Practical implications This paper describes how well automated vulnerability scanners perform when it comes to identifying security issues in a network. The findings suggest that a vulnerability scanner is a useable tool to have in your security toolbox given that user credentials are available for the hosts in your network. Manual effort is however needed to complement automated scanning in order to get satisfactory accuracy regarding network security problems. Originality/value Previous studies have focused on the qualitative aspects on vulnerability assessment. This study presents a quantitative evaluation of seven of the most popular vulnerability scanners available on the market. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Although practitioners continuously emphasize the importance of such policies, information system scholars have not paid the required attention to this context from the cross-cultural perspective. The purpose of this study is to look at the cultural and institutional differences of a multinational company (MNC) and its subsidiaries, and discuss how these differences affect the MNC's strategy to enforce corporate information security policies to its subsidiaries in different cultural settings. The proposed framework considers the effects of the cultural distance, national economy, institutional distance, and stickiness of the knowledge transfer on the process of enforcing information security policies from the parent company to its subsidiaries.","Cultural distance; Information security; Information security policy; Institutional distance; Knowledge transfer; Stickiness","Industry; Information systems; Knowledge management; Security systems; Societies and institutions; Cultural distance; Information security policies; Institutional distance; Knowledge transfer; Stickiness; Security of data"

The most common computer authentication method is text password. Previous research suggests that text password can be hard to remember and users tend to create simple text password that is unsecure. Various password strategies and alternative authentication applications have been proposed, such as mnemonic password, graphical password, and biometrics. However, existing research on the usability of these authentication methods are limited. We conducted a longitudinal empirical study to examine the usability of three authentication methods: traditional text password, mnemonic password, and graphical password, in a real life environment. The result suggests that the graphical password took longer time for authentication and demanded higher work load than the text password and the mnemonic password. © 2011 IEEE.","authentication; graphical password; Information assurance; text password; usability evaluation","Biometrics; Engineering research; Information management; Software engineering; Usability engineering; Authentication methods; Empirical studies; Graphical password; Information assurance; System safety; Text password; Usability evaluation; User authentication; Web-based applications; Work loads; Authentication"

Nevertheless, companies and organizations continue to incur losses associated with security issues. In order to remedy to this situation, we propose a new approach to information security engineering for companies and organizations. First, this approach is based on the standards and good practices of security, second, is inspired from the best practices and feedback of advances in the engineering of enterprise information systems security, and third, its design takes advantage of more than twelve years of experience in system architecture and information security for reknown banks and financial institutions. Our approach to engineering of information systems security aims at: - reducing losses relating to security issues in companies and organizations, operating on an enhanced and sustained information security; - improving the reliability of processes in companies and organizations, and assisting companies in legal and regulatory compliance efforts, operating on security indicators and checkpoints at various levels of management; - helping companies gain competitive advantages through their security management solutions, operating on a global security monitoring system with feedback. As further development of the basic principle of Security know-how Encapsulation into UML profiles [14], we have introduced the mapping global picture of the Process of Security engineering into the formalism of Business Processes. The purpose of this paper is to provide a clear methodology based on the elaboration of the key Security Acts of the process of information systems security engineering. The paper consists of three major parts: - Part One recalls the reasons why BPM has been chosen for our process of system information security. - Part Two develops the key security acts of the process of information systems security engineering. - Part Three shows some security metrics to illustrate the aims of our works.","BPM; Enterprise information system security; Security acts; Security engineering","Competition; Industry; Information management; Information systems; Regulatory compliance; Security systems; Societies and institutions; Standards; Technology transfer; Unified Modeling Language; BPM; Business professionals; Competitive advantage; Enterprise information system; Information systems security; Information systems security engineerings; Security acts; Security engineering; Security of data"

Undoubtedly, one of the main motivations for this is the increase in attacks (e.g., social engineering and phishing) which exploit humans and exemplify why many authors regard them as the weakest link in the security chain. As research in the socio-technical security and trust fields gains momentum, it is crucial to intermittently pause and reflect on their progress while also considering related domains to determine whether there are any established principles which may be transferred. Comparison of the states-of-the-arts may assist in planning work going forward and identifying useful future directions for the less mature socio-technical field. This paper seeks to fulfil several of these goals, particularly as they relate to the emerging cybersecurity-risk communication domain. The literature reviews which we conduct here are beneficial and indeed noteworthy as they pull together a number of the key aspects which may affect the trustworthiness and effectiveness of communications on cybersecurity risks. In particular, we draw on information-trustworthiness research and the established field of risk communication. An appreciation of these aspects and precepts is imperative if systems are to be designed that play to individuals' strengths and assist them in maintaining security and protecting their applications and information. © 2011 IEEE.","Cybersecurity risk; information trustworthiness; risk perception and communication; security communication recommendations","Communication; Risk perception; Communication domain; Cyber security; Effective communication; information trustworthiness; Literature reviews; Risk perception and communications; Security and trusts; Security communication; Network security"

The Dams Sector Roadmap to Secure Control Systems effectively describes a concise plan and provides strategic direction for voluntarily improving the cybersecurity posture of control systems within the Dams Sector, including specified goals and milestones on which to focus efforts and activities, while addressing the sector's most urgent challenges. An effective implementation of these concepts is represented by the corporate strategy developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to identify short-, mid-, and long-term solutions to comply with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards. USACE has committed to a program of voluntary compliance to meet all applicable NERC reliability standards within resources and operating constraints. Major challenges include the existence of a wide variety of industrial control systems across the different USACE Divisions and Districts. These systems range from those designed and installed over 20 years ago, which are highly dependent on human interaction, to newer, more sophisticated systems. This paper describes the development of the Army Corps of Engineers Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Program (ACE-CME), in collaboration with the USACE Critical Infrastructure Protection and Resilience (CIPR) Program, to monitor and assess current and future requirements. These efforts will identify critical compliance-related issues and propose solutions promoting cost-effectiveness.","","Control systems; Regulatory compliance; Reliability; Safety engineering; Army Corps of Engineers; Compliance monitoring; Control systems securities; Critical infrastructure protection; Industrial control systems; Operating constraints; Secure control systems; Sophisticated system; Dams"

Wide access to and use of information and communication technologies and interactions of users by means of these technologies have opened the door to cyberspace, which has been misused by many for the commission of crimes. The increase of users has resulted in a growth of abuses but users are unfortunately rarely aware of dangers, on the one hand and, on the other, of possibilities of countering these threats effectively. The results of an internet survey carried out in March 2011 provide an insight into the perception of cybercrime and understanding of the fear of cybercrime. The findings of the survey, based on statistical analysis, show how respondents perceive cybercrime. It was established that respondents are relatively familiar with the notion of cybercrime but are more aware of threats highlighted by the media. In this connection, it must not be overlooked that these threats, which are widely known, do not necessarily represent a threat to the safety of users, although they nevertheless increase their fear of cybercrime. The paper provides principal guidelines, formulated on the basis of knowledge and research results, which, if taken into consideration, could curb risks in cyberspace. These guidelines provide a starting point for a larger awareness of dangers, as well as a source of instructions for the safer use of cyberspace. It is likely that better understanding of threats and greater knowledge of measures against them could reduce the fear of cybercrime. These findings have practical implications and are useful for the study of cybercrime, as well as for cyberspace users.","Awareness; Cybercrime; Fear of crime; Information security; Perception; Slovenia",""

We utilized qualitative and quantitative survey data provided by senior IT managers from 250 healthcare organizations. The data provides a snapshot of patient information security in the surveyed organizations. Healthcare organizations must focus on preventing breaches (which results in brand damage and direct remediation costs) as well as complying with government regulation (to avoid indirect costs, including fines and penalties). Using hierarchical linear modeling (ULM), we examine how specific security practices improve regulatory compliance, protect patient information, and minimize the impact of a breach incident. The results show that audit polices are positively associated with perceived regulatory compliance and security policies are associated with security performance. We also find that the interaction of both audit and security policies has a more significant effect than either type alone. Surprisingly, an organization's level of compliance is not significantly associated with actual security performance. This study contributes to demonstrating which security practices can help the organizations comply with the regulations and the effects of security practices and regulatory compliance on information security performance. This can provide healthcare organizations with strategic guidelines to improve their regulatory compliance and security performance. © (2011) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office, All rights reserved.","Compliance; Healthcare; HIPPA; HITECH; Security","Health care; Information systems; Management; Regulatory compliance; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Compliance; Government regulation; Healthcare organizations; Hi-tech; Hierarchical linear modeling; HIPPA; Security; Security performance; Security systems"

Controls should be planned and realized at the international, country and bank levels because everyone who has to use financial services wants to be sure that data about their assets are secure. Almost everyone use the electronic services of financial institutions and therefore information security issues can not be overemphasized. To increase security in computerized actions of financial institutions, a certain supervisory authorization must be established. In order to cleverly realize such questions as ""How much security is necessary?"", ""How much security is sufficient?"" and ""How to be shore that operations are secure"", a systematic approach to assess the state of security is necessary. In the current case, these questions should be answered by financial supervisors to provide assurances that people's money is safe in banks and in other financial institutions. In this paper we shall propose a new compliance assessment and monitoring method for these purposes. The key concept presented and used through the research is named as technology assurance (TA), it is all which gives the feel of security in using technology and this may be treated as synonym for the term information assurance (IA). To ensure technology assurance, the lowest steps have to be passed to go higher level. Technology assurance presumes that business processes are well organized, information assets and IT governance is well established and IT risks are managed to build up higher level assurance like information security measures, information systems/information security auditing and to reach highest levels like business continuity preparation. To answer to the main research questions mentioned above, the subquestions like ""How much to regulate?"" should be answered. Considering some facts about Estonia and financial sector - Estonia is a member of European Union, the bigger banks in Estonia are the subsidiaries, we have launched Euro lately - it is essential to be in accordance with European practices in developing our standards to regulate the financial sector and IT field. During the research, survey about current arrangements in 29 European countries was studied and this paper describes the survey focusing on the results. The question was: how the European countries regulate financial sector IT field and what the requirements are the financial institutions should fulfill to ensure the security of electronic operations? The main results of survey show that the most important issue to cover with regulations was IT risk management, also business continuity process and information security policy were covered in most cases. About a half of respondents highlight the need to regulate IT outsourcing and access control management issues. In common, the survey confirms the trend for more strict regulation of IT in financial sector and Estonia tends to be top level regarding regulations.","Business continuity; Compliance assessment; Financial sector; Information security; Information technology","Access control; Finance; Outsourcing; Regulatory compliance; Research; Risk management; Security of data; Surveys; Business continuity; Business Process; Compliance assessment; Control management; Electronic services; Estonia; European Countries; European union; Financial crisis; Financial institution; Financial sectors; Financial service; Information assets; Information assurance; Information security policies; IT governance; IT outsourcing; Monitoring methods; Research questions; Information technology"

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), when implemented in the e-governance domain, combines all the government functions together into one single integrated system with a central database. This system serves the information needs of all the departments across geographies, while allowing them to communicate with each other. For this it is necessary to understand that government has become more dependent on modern technologies that have the potential to create seamless, responsive, and citizen-centric government for the benefit of all. At the same time, it has become increasingly vulnerable to a range of risks, from interruption of operations that are based on computers to loss of confidential data. Government agencies at all levels (national, provincial, and local) must protect the computer systems that they own and operate. Information security requires a combination of business, management, and technical measures in an on-going process. Security is costly, but like privacy, it should be addressed in the design phase and periodically reviewed. This chapter contributes to the ERP enabled e-governance literature for understanding threats and risks, clarification and investigation of the techniques in mitigating these challenges and issues involved in improving e-governance security. The interest generated by the ERP phenomenon in the public sector, and the peculiarities of this sector make specific studies of ERP in government organizations necessary.

Information security ensures business continuity and minimizes business damage by preventing and reducing the impact of security incidents. However, information security efforts are certainly not as effective as one would have wished for. A commonly accepted reason for this is the insecure behaviour of people. This insecure behaviour is often due to a lack of knowledge, awareness, education and training. In order to address this, many organisations provide security education, training and awareness programs to their employees. However, these programs often do not achieve a persistent change towards secure behaviour. The various reasons that contribute to the failure of security education, training and awareness programs and cause the trend towards insecure behaviour are briefly discussed. It follows that changing the behaviour of people is an inherently difficult task that requires the consideration of many factors. Similarly, a tool that intends to address insecure behaviour needs to consider various technological elements that may contribute in its ability to influence behaviour. The aim of this paper is to propose the principles of a personal information security agent and explore a set of objectives and criteria that may contribute to its success in influencing and reminding individuals towards a more secure behaviour. The criteria stem from various domains such as persuasive technology and human computer interaction. Persuasive technology has been applied in various domains to shape, reinforce or change people's behaviour. We describe related work that has been done using persuasive technology, and build on it. The proposed criteria consists of functions such as ""To motivate"" and characteristics such as ""Context sensitivity"". To put the theory into practice, a prototype of a personal security agent has been developed that implements some of the criteria. Based on this, a discussion on the development and implementation of the prototype and its potential benefits has been included. The prototype was developed to test the proposed criteria in a practical experiment that will form part of future research.","Human behaviour; Human computer interaction; Information security; Information security awareness; Persuasive technology","Human computer interaction; Security of data; Technology; Awareness program; Business continuity; Context sensitivity; Education and training; Human behaviours; Information security awareness; Personal information; Personal security; Persuasive technology; Potential benefits; Security agents; Security education; Security incident; Personnel training"

Despite its usefulness and cost-effectiveness, public cloud computing service is hard to accept because there are many security concerns such as data leakage, unauthorized access from outside the system and abnormal activities from inside the system. To detect these abnormal activities, intrusion detection system (IDS) require a learning process that can cause system performance degradation. However, providing high performance computing environment to the subscribers is very important, so a lightweight anomaly detection method is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a lightweight IDS with self-similarity measures to resolve these problems. Normally, a regular and periodic self-similarity can be observed in a cloud system's internal activities such as system calls and process status. On the other hand, outliers occur when an anomalous attack happens, and then the system's self-similarity cannot be maintained. So monitoring a system's self-similarity can be used to detect the system's anomalies. We developed a new measure based on cosine similarity and found the optimal time interval for estimating the self-similarity of a given system. As a result, we can detect abnormal activities using only a few resources. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anomaly detection; Cloud computing; Information security; Intrusion detection; Lightweight; Self-similarity","Cloud computing; Database systems; Intrusion detection; Security of data; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection methods; Cloud systems; Computing services; Cosine similarity; Data leakage; High performance computing; Internal activity; Intrusion detection method; Intrusion Detection Systems; Key success factors; Learning process; Lightweight; Optimal time; Self-similarities; System calls; System performance degradation; Computer systems"

This leads to the common call for yet more legislation against vendors and other producers in order to lower the risk of insecure software. We argue that the call for nationalized intervention does not decrease risk, but rather the user of software has an economic choice in selecting features over security. In this paper, we investigate the economic impact of various decisions as a means of determining the optimal distribution of costs and liability when applied to information security and in particular when assigning costs in software engineering. The users of a software product act rationally when weighing software risks and costs. The choice of delivering features and averting risk is not an option demanded by the end user. After all, it is of little value to increase the cost per unit of software if this means that users purchase the alternative product with more features. We argue that the market models proposed are flawed and not the concept of a market itself. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Derivatives; DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act); Game theory; IDS (Intrusion Detection System); MTTF (Mean Time To Failure); Ploc (per (source) Lines of Code); SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle); Security; Software Development; Vulnerability Market","Commerce; Costs; Derivatives; Game theory; Intrusion detection; Software design; Software engineering; DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act); IDS (Intrusion Detection System); Lines of code; Mean time to failure; SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle); Security; Vulnerability Market; Risks"

Wow is assumed to be more than acceptable user experience, it is something that exceeds users' expectations. There is relatively little research on the specific concept of Wow and how it can be achieved. In our multi-year Cloud software project with over 20 industrial partners we have found a strong interest in establishing basic understanding of this concept and further, design implications for bringing Wow to Cloud services. To this end, we first conducted two small online surveys to understand the general user perceptions of Wow. We then explored two specific Cloud application domains - personal contact management and information security services - in more detail by conducting two rounds of user interviews on how Wow is perceived in these domains. In this paper we present the results of these user studies and draw design implications for Wow in Cloud services. The main design implications include providing positive surprises to the users by pushing dynamic service features through the Cloud, supporting automated data integration of and universal access to user's personal data, and moderating the level and types of Wow for ""serious"" application domains. © 2011 ACM.","Cloud services; design implications; user experience; Wow","Distributed database systems; Product design; Product development; Security of data; Web services; Application domains; Automated data; Cloud services; Design implications; Dynamic services; Industrial partners; Online surveys; Personal contacts; Software project; Universal access; User experience; User perceptions; User study; Wow; Surveys"

This situation is increasingly important in the developing e-health environment. Information security is everyone's responsibility and it is extensively documented in international standards and best practice frameworks, that this responsibility should be part of formal job descriptions. This necessitates incorporation of security at a functional level for all staff. These responsibilities are integral to demonstrable accountability, together with an authority to take action. Indeed, whilst senior management will ultimately be held accountable, staff need to be aware of the potential issues, given the responsibility to be vigilant, and the authority to act when information security issues arise. This is pertinent within Australian primary healthcare where the accountability for information security is most often devolved to the role of the practice manager. This paper analyses information security accountability from an operational and strategic security capability viewpoint in terms of responsibility and authority. Further, it discusses this in regard to the associated information security governance perspective. In the trustful primary healthcare environment, the accountability for information security resides with operational level staff who have many competing aspects to their role. The paper suggests how to manage this layer of security without burdening the already busy practice manager.","Accountability; CMM; General medical practice; Governance capability; Healthcare security; Information security governance","Employment; Health care; Industrial management; Job analysis; Managers; Accountability; CMM; Governance capability; Information security governance; Medical practice; Security of data"

The interviews focused on the activities of control management as well as on the roles and responsibilities of the individuals and groups involved in those activities.

By using clustering, a technique from machine learning, fast detection of forged packets from Chinese government censor-ware becomes tractable. These new techniques expose previously hidden examples of sophisticated man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and the algorithms used in these attacks.

Current cryptosystems rely on mathematics, which take information processing as transformation of numbers or characters. I.e., plaintext, key and crypto text are in the same information level or logical level. Only ""one-time pad"" system has been proved information-theoretical secure, the rest are computational secure. In fact, the information that we can ""see"", whatever characters, symbols, numbers or images, and whatever on paper or on screen, is composed of dots distributed in 2-D space. However, modern cryptosystems take information as computable numbers or characters, and simplify the 2-D structure of numbers or characters as one dimension information structure. Here we show that a virtual genome-based cryptosystem (VGC) is a new cryptography based on system theory with many new properties different from that of previous cryptography based on information theory. We design a 2-D structure virtual DNA micro array chip (VDMC), where microdots are corresponding to virtual genes in virtual genome database (VGDB), which DNA sequences are randomly generated. When information is written on VDMC, microdots are selected and marked to compose characters, symbols, numbers or images, and the corresponding virtual genes are determined. A short sequence which is unique in VGDB was selected from the virtual gene, and the uniqueness is ensured by BLAST or other string matching algorithms. Then, the selected microdots on VDMC to compose the information are encrypted into short DNA sequences in VGDB. Decryption is just to use short DNA sequences as queries to BLAST against VGDB and find out virtual genes which have identical homolog with the queries, the corresponding microdots were marked on VDMC, and then the plaintext information can be recognized. As a convenient and secure cryptosystem, VGC can be applied in all areas of information security. © 2011 IEEE.","cryptography; system theory; Virtual genome","Cryptography; Data processing; DNA; DNA sequences; Genes; Image matching; Information theory; System theory; 2-D space; DNA micro-array; Genome database; Information structures; Logical levels; One dimension; Plaintext; Short sequences; String matching algorithm; Security of data"

They demonstrated a (t, n) visual secret sharing scheme, in which visual information is encoded into' shares so that only someone with t or more than t shares could decrypt this visual information, while nothing would be revealed by any t-I shares. Particularly, the decryption is performed directly by stacking shares and the concealed information is gained by human visual system without any cryptographic computations. Additionally, a keyed (t, n) visual secret sharing scheme is also considered, in which some specific shares, called keyed shares, must be involved to recover the visual information. Without the help of the keyed shares, no information will be retrieved. Information hiding is the art of imperceptibly embedding some information into the digital work and getting it more or less modified as a result. In this paper, we design a scheme in which the redundancy in visual secret sharing scheme is employed for embedding additional information. According to the similar concept, information hiding technique based on the (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3) visual secret sharing schemes and (2, 3) keyed visual secret sharing scheme are proposed. From the experimental results, the proposed schemes not only contribute the functionality of visual cryptography, but also provide with the ability of information hiding.","Information hiding; Information security; Steganography; Visual cryptography; Visual secret sharing; Watermarking","Cybernetics; Digital watermarking; Information theory; Security of data; Steganography; Cryptographic computations; Human Visual System; Information hiding; Visual cryptography; Visual information; Visual secret sharing; Visual secret sharing schemes; Cryptography"

Home users' security should be an important research topic in IS security research, not only from the perspective of protecting home users' personal or work information on their home computers, but also because hijacked home computers have become an ideal breading ground for hackers attacking organizations, and distributing illegal or morally questionable material. Despite the importance of studying home users' security behaviour, the primary focus of the behavioural IS security research has been on an organizational context. While this research at an organizational context is important, we argue that the ""home users"" context require more attention by scholars. While there are similarities between ""home users' IS security behaviour"" and ""employees' compliance with IS security procedures at organizational context"", it is necessary to understand their differences, to allow research and practice on ""home users security behaviour"" to develop further. We argue that previous research has not paid attention to such differences. As a first step in remedying the gap in our understanding, we first theorise these differences, we consider, that there are at least nine contextual factors that may result in an individual's behaviour inconsistency in the workplace and home, and because of this, we argue that the same theories may not explain the use of security features in home and organizational contexts. Based on this conceptualization, we present a research agenda for studying home users' security behaviour.","Contextual factors; Home user; Individual's behaviour inconsistency; Information security behaviour","Information systems; Personal computers; Personal computing; Research; Security of data; Computer users; Contextual factors; Home users; Individual's behaviour inconsistency; Organizational context; Research agenda; Research topics; Security features; Security procedures; Security research; Behavioral research"

As security policy management involves the elements of policy development process and the security policy as output, the context for security policy assessment requires goal-based metrics for these two elements. However, the current security management assessment methods only provide checklist types of assessment that are predefined by industry best practices and do not allow for developing specific goal-based metrics. Utilizing theories drawn from literature, this paper proposes the Enterprise Information Security Policy Assessment approach that expands on the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach. The proposed assessment approach is then applied in a case scenario example to illustrate a practical application. It is shown that the proposed framework addresses the requirement for developing assessment metrics and allows for the concurrent undertaking of process-based and product-based assessment. Recommendations for further research activities include the conduct of empirical research to validate the propositions and the practical application of the proposed assessment approach in case studies to provide opportunities to introduce further enhancements to the approach.","Information security management assessment; Information security policy; Security assessment; Security policy assessment","Cybernetics; Industrial management; Industry; Information science; Public policy; Research; Security of data; Software testing; Assessment activities; Assessment approaches; Assessment metrics; Business goals; Empirical research; Goal-question-metric; Goal-question-metric approach; Information security managements; Information security policies; Policy development process; Research activities; Security assessment; Security management; Security policy; Security policy management; Security systems"

The major challenge for health care providers is to understand the importance information security whilst also incorporating effective protection into established workflow and daily activity. Why then, when it is difficult for IT and security professionals to navigate through and apply the myriad of information security standards, do we expect small enterprises such as primary health care providers to also be able to do this. This is an onerous and impractical task without significant assistance. In the development of the new Computer and Information Security Standards (CISS) for Australian General Practice, a consistent and iterative process for the interpretation and application of international standards was used. This involved both the interpretation of the standards and the application of knowledge to create a practical but acceptable level of security for the primary healthcare environment. From a security perspective such practical application of standards poses the dichotomous challenge (and criticism) of how much security is sufficient versus how much can the primary healthcare environment manage. This paper describes the path of development from standards to implementation using the CISS as an example. It is concluded that more practical assistance is required by the security profession to support the national e-health initiative if Australia is to provide a safe and secure healthcare environment.","Healthcare security; Information security; Medical; Standards","Health care; Industrial management; Security of data; Australia; Daily activity; e-Health systems; Ehealth; Health care providers; Healthcare environments; International standards; Iterative process; Medical; Patient information; Primary healthcare; Security professionals; Security standards; Small enterprise; Standards"

A number of qualitative and quantitative models and approaches are employed by risk practitioners to keep risk under check. As a norm most organizations end up choosing the more flexible, easier to deploy and customize qualitative models of risk assessment. In practice one sees that such models often call upon the practitioners to make qualitative judgments on a relative rating scale which brings in considerable room for errors, biases and subjectivity. On the other hand under the quantitative risk analysis approach, estimation of risk is connected with application of numerical measures of some kind. Medical risk management models lend themselves as ideal candidates for deriving lessons for Information Security Risk Management. We can use this considerably developed understanding of risk management from the medical field towards handling risks that information infrastructures face. Similarly, financial risk management discipline prides itself on perhaps the most quantifiable of models in risk management. The concept of VaR, developed by banks is a generic measure of economic loss that could equate risk across products and aggregate risk on a port-folio basis. VaR model could be adopted to create a risk index calculated and reported by Information security departments in organizations. During the recent financial crisis many investors and financial institutions lost money or went bankrupt respectively, because they did not apply the basic principles of risk management.

However, for modular software to be securely interoperable with other software products requires agreed consistent and accountable interfaces. This agreement may take the form of bilateral vendor to vendor arrangements or via a trusted external third-party who coordinates agreed interaction methods, such as a jurisdiction. Standards are a particular form of mutually trusted third party. Unfortunately, this agreed method of interoperability is not always present in vendor software. Where one software product or module interacts with another, in the absence of any agreement, it is referred to as ""bolt-on"". It is perhaps more descriptive to refer to such software in terms of its potential to cause harm and refer to it using the biological analogy of ""parasitic"" software and associated ""host"" software. Analogous to biological systems, parasitic software can operate by data injection into or data extraction from, the associated host database. Both forms of parasitic software exploit access mechanisms or security flaws in the host software independent of the host vendor and in ways not intended or supported by the host vendor. This paper discusses the mechanics of this security vulnerability and more importantly, the potential adverse consequences to patient safety of such susceptibilities. As Australia moves to a national connected e-health system these issues are causes for grave concern. This paper provides a case study of this insecurity to highlight the problem, promote discussion and encourage potential change.","Bolt-on software; Health information security; Healthcare software; Medical software; Third party software","Health care; Industrial management; Interoperability; Security of data; Access mechanism; Australia; Biological analogies; Data extraction; e-Health systems; Health informations; Healthcare environments; Interaction methods; Medical software; Modular designs; Modular softwares; Patient safety; Potential change; Security flaws; Security vulnerabilities; Software products; Software systems; Third party software; Trusted third parties; Product design"

Teleworking delivers cost savings, improved productivity and provides a recruitment policy to attract and retain personnel. Information security is one of the management considerations necessary before an effective organisational teleworking policy can be implemented. The teleworking computing environment presents a different set of security threats to those present in an office environment. Teleworking requires a security model to provide security policy enforcement to counter the set of security threats present in the teleworking computing environment. This paper considers four existing security models and assesses each model's suitability to define security policy enforcement for telework. The approach taken is to identify the information security threats that exist in a teleworking environment and to categorise the threats based upon their impact upon confidentiality of data, system and data integrity, and availability of service in the teleworking environment. It is found that risks exist to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in a teleworking environment and therefore a security model is required that provides appropriate policy enforcement. A set of security policy enforcement mechanisms to counter the identified information security threats is proposed. Using an abstraction of the identified threats and the security policy enforcement mechanisms, a set of attributes for a security model for teleworking is proposed. Each of the four existing security models is assessed against this set of attributes to determine its suitability to specify policy enforcement for telework. Although the four existing models were selected based upon their perceived suitability it is found that none provide the required policy enforcement for telework.","Information security; Secure teleworking; Security model; Security policy enforcement; Teleworking","Industrial management; Security of data; Security systems; Broadband service; Computing environments; Cost saving; Data integrity; Information security threats; Office environments; Policy enforcement; Security model; Security policy enforcement; Security threats; Telework; Teleworking; Work practices; Telecommuting"

Potential problems were developed by using Hofstede's framework of culture and the recently proposed theory of Level of Potential (LoP) was adopted to predict their magnitudes. Three online surveys were conducted in Russia, India and China to evaluate the severity of the potential problems and the practicability of LoP. It is proved that the theory of LoP can predict problems for British companies in economically rising business environments to a certain extent.

Many researches have been done to establish and maintain the trust relationship in cloud. Remote attestation is one of the most important feature of trusted computing. But conventional ways of remote attestation can only attest to the presence of a particular binary. They cannot measure program behavior. Existing dynamic remote attestation technologies can solve some of these problems. But they are not suitable for cloud computing when users lose their control over their critical data and business processes. In our opinion, cloud should give controls back to the users at some extent. So we propose TBVMM, a novel mechanism for cloud computing to fill the trust gap between the infrastructure and upper software stacks. TBVMM will pave a way for establishing better trust relationships in cloud environments. © 2011 IEEE.","bytecode virtual machine; cloud computing; remote attestation; trusted computing","Computer simulation; Data processing; Security of data; Business Process; Bytecodes; Critical data; Program behavior; Remote attestation; Software stacks; Trust relationship; Trusted computing; Virtual machines; Cloud computing"

The business owners have realized that, risk creates opportunity which in turn creates value. Identifying and mitigating risk proactively across the enterprise is the purview of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).However, key errors in the ERM process such as misinterpretation of statistical data, overlooking change management, inadequate attention to supply chain interdependencies, excessive trust of insiders and business partners, ambiguous grouping of risks and poor documentation has contributed significantly to the failure of ERM. To examine the ERM perception in Oman, the authors have conducted a survey among various risk management practitioners. Based on the findings, the authors have broadly classified risk into three types namely business risks, technical risks and regulatory risks and threat vs. consequence mapping is defined to provide direction to moderately group risks. Further, this article defines various ERM approaches including due diligence, probabilistic risk analysis, scenario-based analysis and system analysis which offers a wide range of decision-support tools to the management.","Enterprise Risk management; Information security risk management; Maturity model for ERM","Decision support systems; Industrial management; Industry; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Supply chains; Business owners; Business partners; Business risks; Change management; Decision support tools; Due diligence; Dynamic nature; Enterprise governance; Enterprise IS; Enterprise risk management; Exploratory studies; Maturity model; Mitigating risk; Probabilistic risk analysis; Regulatory requirements; Regulatory risks; Risk optimization; Scenario-based analysis; Statistical datas; Technical risks; Risk perception"

In a heterogeneous, multi-regulated, multi-disciplined and global environment, corporations are often required to adhere to more than one standard and best practice method. Compliance auditing (CA) is the process that identifies and analyses any misalignment and non-compliance of the organization's rules and policies vis-a-vis government regulations.

Authenticated connection establishment between client and server requires password verification, in which client provides the password and server verifies it. Successful password verification initiates the client/Server to perform secured request/reply mechanisms. Hence there is need for confidential transmission of password in an unsecured network. Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no-one apart from the sender (client) and intended recipient(Server) even realizes there is a hidden message. The term Steganography includes the concealment of digital information within computer files. Generally a Steganography messages will appear to be something else: a picture, an article, a shopping list, or some other message.Steganography techniques can be used for providing confidentiality of password. This paper intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and techniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good steganographic algorithm and briefly reflects on which steganographic techniques are more suitable for which applications. In this paper I would like to focus on the most secured connection establishment for client/Server Environment.

In this tutorial, we present a method to analyze and design security controls that capture the organizational setting of the system and where business goals and processes are the main citizen. The SI*-GRC method is a comprehensive method that is composed of i) a modeling framework based on a requirement engineering framework, with some extensions related to security & GRC concerns, such as: trust, permission, risk, and treatment, 2) a analysis process defining systematical steps in analyzing and design security controls, 3) analytical techniques to verify that certain security properties are satisfied and the risk level is acceptable, and at last 4) a CASE tool, namely the SI*Tool to support analysts in using the method.

A new secure comparison protocol based on the additive homomorphic property and a new scheme of secret sharing in the encrypted domain with secure comparison are proposed.

Here the random phase masks and the Hartley transforms are the encryption parameters. It is shown that the decrypted image matches with the input image only when the correct keys are used during the process of decryption. To check the robustness of the technique, mean square error (MSE) between the decrypted and original image has been calculated.

These unobservable attacks present a potentially serious threat to grid operations. Of particular interest are sparse attacks that involve the compromise of a modest number of meter readings. An efficient algorithm to find all unobservable attacks [under standard DC load flow approximations] involving the compromise of exactly two power injection meters and an arbitrary number of line power meters is presented. This requires O(n 2m) flops for a power system with n buses and m line meters. If all lines are metered, there exist canonical forms that characterize all 3, 4, and 5-sparse unobservable attacks. These can be quickly detected in power systems using standard graph algorithms.

Automatic signature recognition and verification is one of the biometric techniques, which is currently receiving renewed interest and is only one of several techniques used to verify the identities of individuals. Signatures provide a secure means for confirmation and authorization in legal documents. So nowadays, signature identification and verification becomes an essential component in automating the rapid processing of documents containing embedded signatures. In this paper, a technique for a bi-script off-line signature identification system is proposed. In the proposed signature identification system, the signatures of English and Bengali (Bangla) are considered for the identification process. Different features such as under sampled bitmaps, modified chain-code direction features and gradient features computed from both background and foreground components are employed for this purpose. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Nearest Neighbour (NN) techniques are considered as classifiers for signature identification in the proposed system. A database of 1554 English signatures and 1092 Bengali signatures are used to generate the experimental results. Various results based on different features are calculated and analysed. The highest accuracies of 99.41%, 98.45%; and 97.75% are obtained based on the modified chain-code direction, under-sampled bitmaps and gradient features respectively using 1800 (1100 English+700 Bengali) samples for training and 846 (454 English+392 Bengali) samples for testing. © 2011 IEEE.","Authentication systems; Biometrics; Modified chain-code directions; Offline systems; Signature identification; SVMs","Biometrics; Codes (symbols); Embedded systems; Security of data; Support vector machines; Authentication systems; Chain codes; Offline systems; Signature identification; SVMs; Authentication"

Thus, previous studies have focused on the acquisition of information from the change in the amplitude of the clock signal or its harmonic signal. However, there has been little discussion about the acquisition of information by using fluctuations of the clock in the frequency domain.

In this paper, a quantitative risk analysis approach for deliberate threats is introduced. The proposed approach follows the steps suggested by the ISO 27005 standard for risk management, extending them in order to focus on deliberate threats and the different information security incidents that realize them. It is based on three-levels: the conceptual foundation level, the modeling tools level and the mathematical foundation level. The conceptual foundation level defines and analyzes the terminology involved, using unified modeling language (UML) class diagrams. The modeling tools level introduces certain tools that assist in modeling the relations among different concepts. Finally, the mathematical foundation level includes all the different mathematical formulas and techniques used to estimate risk values for each threat. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","deliberate threat; quantitative; risk analysis; risk estimation; risk identification","Critical infrastructures; Foundations; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risk perception; Terminology; Unified Modeling Language; Conceptual foundations; Deliberate threats; Mathematical formulas; Mathematical foundations; Modeling tool; quantitative; Quantitative risk analysis; risk estimation; risk identification; Risk management program; Risk value; Techniques used; Unified modeling language class diagrams; Security of data"

Existing techniques such as Misuse detection methods identify packets that match a known pattern or signature. However, these methods fail to detect unknown anomalies. Hence, anomaly detection methods were used to identify the traffic patterns that deviate from the modeled normal traffic behavior. The identified anomalies could be either an attack or normal traffic. The focus in this paper is to monitor the resources of remote server and to detect the malicious traffic. This led to two contributions in this paper. First is the design and implementation of Remote server monitoring (REONIT) tool and the second is the confirmation of attacks by neural ensemble. Local and remote server resources are monitored through REONIT. The REONIT has been implemented using the existing ideas and has the following components, viz., Authentication port let to monitor the distributed resources, Web Port let, which processes requests and generates dynamic content, RRD tool for data storage and visualization, XML for data representation in the form of graphs, and Message Alert, which warns the victim server if any eccentric traffic pattern occurs. REONIT tool was deployed in SSE Testbed* and the resources were monitored. The results were displayed as graphs. From the results, it is confirmed that the anomalous behavior and the high resource utilization observed in the display were due to attacks and not due to legitimate traffic. © 2011 IEEE.","Ensemble of classifiers; Remote Server Monitoring","Artificial intelligence; Communication systems; Security of data; Visualization; Anomalous behavior; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection methods; AS graph; Data representations; Data storage; Distributed resources; Dynamic content; Ensemble of classifiers; Malicious traffic; Misuse detection; Neural ensembles; Remote Server Monitoring; Remote servers; Resource utilizations; Traffic behavior; Traffic pattern; Vulnerability assessment tool; Data visualization"

Today, it is required that risk treatment is discussed also in terms of security investment. Considering that a security model can be represented as a set of risk formulas, we propose a new risk formula that can also represent improvement factors of security. The resulting formula is R= e C·Aα A VαV Tα T , which includes the conventional multiplicative risk formula. We show how to calculate α's by using the risk reduction matrix. As an available scenario, we propose that we use the formula as a perturbation to the conventional risk formula. We show an example scenario in which by using the conventional multiplicative risk formula and a risk reduction matrix for representing the risk improving factor, a risk value is re-calculated. Security investment can also be evaluated by using our formula. Moreover, we propose that α's represent a factor of significance in decision making. © 2011 IEEE.","Risk assessment; Risk formula; Security; Security investment","Investments; Perturbation techniques; Quality control; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Security of data; Improvement factors; matrix; Organizational information; Qualitative approach; Risk improvement; Risk reductions; Risk treatment; Risk value; Security; Security investments; Security model; Risk assessment"

However, many concerns surrounding cloud computing remain unaddressed. How are the data we store online kept confidential? Who else has the right to access our private information? What kind of laws and policies offer us protection? We begin by evaluating the current situation by examining the Terms of Service (ToS) agreements and privacy policies from well-known cloud providers, and we describe the types of privacy protections (or lack thereof) that they offer. We conclude that a contractarian approach to privacy protection is likely to lead to a situation in which consumers end up trading their privacy without being well-informed about the implications and consequences of their choices. Next, we examine whether the applicable laws are adequate to protect the privacy of consumers in the cloud. We discuss privacy protections in the cloud by considering the Fourth Amendment, the Stored Communications Act, the Federal Information Security Management Act, and the USA PATRIOT Act, and we conclude that they are inadequate in according a minimum level of privacy to consumers in the cloud, setting the stage for a vigorous study of the form and substance of cloud computing-centric privacy legislation. © 2011 ACM.","cloud computing; cloud computing contracts; legal aspects; privacy","Data privacy; Internet; Laws and legislation; Security of data; Cloud providers; Current situation; Fourth amendment; Human lives; Information security managements; Legal aspects; Privacy legislation; Privacy policies; Privacy protection; Private information; Technological innovation; USA patriot act; Cloud computing"

To solve these problems, a permission model called Flexible Organization Structure-Based Access Control (FOSBAC) is proposed, which combines the flexible organization structure with the access control to achieve the dynamic management of permissions. First, the general framework and the formal description of FOSBAC are given. Then, the application template using the XACML specification is constructed and an analysis on a case of accessing financial statements is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the application.

Generally information hiding is used to protect, authenticate data or for secret communication such as military secret information. It can be achieved in communication protocols, digital multimedia content such as image, text and audio. Currently available information hiding techniques do not pay much attention on stego-object (hidden information in original object) with respect to its original cover (original) object. Both cover and stego-images are drifted in context of edge characteristics of image objects. That is not affordable in some application such as medical domains applications. This paper proposes an information hiding method around the edge boundary of objects in image. The stego-image can be utilized for further processing methods (such as segmentation, identification, and recognition of objects etc). The experimental results show that the stego-image has identical edge boundaries as is in cover-image (using 'Sobel' and 'Canny' edge detection methods), so stego-image can directly be used instead of cover-image for further image processing techniques. Proposed edge based information hiding scheme is secure due to its varying calculated thresholds and has less computational cost.","Edge based data embedding; Edge boundary data embedding; Information embedding; LSB based embedding","Edge detection; Security of data; Boundary data; Computational costs; Cover-image; Data embedding; Digital multimedia; Edge detection methods; Edge-based; Hidden information; Image objects; Image processing technique; Information embedding; Information hiding; LSB based embedding; Medical domains; Processing method; Secret information; Stego image; Image segmentation"

The focus of this development was given to steganography to build such techniques. This paper presents a novel technique for Image steganography based on a frequency domain, where DCT is used to transform original image (cover image) blocks from spatial domain to frequency domain, and then Huffman encoding is performed on the secret messages/images before it is embedded in the frequency domain. The number of payload bits L is embedded into the DCT coefficient based on the DCT coefficient value of cover image in order to maximize the hiding capacity.

It is therefore necessary that military communication infrastructures can be interconnected to facilitate the information sharing. This information sharing requires a high level of assurance on the security of interconnections. However it is often difficult to identify the appropriate security requirements, due to the complexity as a result of the differences between the applicable security policies. The methodology aims to provide a structured approach to define the appropriate security requirements and enable the determination of a balanced set of security measures for an interconnection. By decomposing the interconnection on a conceptual level into smaller parts, compartments can be defined that address a subset of the entire complexity. Between all these compartments as well as the own and other domain Security Policy Enforcement Points (SPEPs) can be defined. The division into compartments is based on the classification level, security policy and operational responsibility for the information.

By using the collected data from a survey that we conducted in March 2010 and employing a stepwise logit model as a statistical tool, we analyze the relationships between decision making on not complying with the rule and some attributes. As a result, we found the some features of respondents who took problematic behavior. First of all, the psychological factors such as risk perception and risk aversion influence the problematic behaviors. Next, the high individuals' morals are able to prevent their taking problematic behaviors. Third, the individuals who experienced some information security accidents, or the individuals whose degree of workplace satisfaction is low, tend to take problematic behavior. In addition, by introducing power shift from ruling body to lower organization as the incentive system for employee's working, individuals come to tend to take problematic behaviors.

However, traditional access control solutions suffer from difficulties both in the access rights authorization and the usage policy enforcement, especially under the heterogeneous, distributed network environments. In this paper, a new architecture called TUC (trusted usage control) is proposed against the information security requirements under distributed environment based on usage control model and trusted computing technology. TUC is presented to achieve usage control based upon the hardware trust root TPM. In this way, confidentiality, integrity and controllability of the data are assured not only in distribution, transmission, storage but also in usage control. It is necessary to design TUC as a general access solution by binding policies to the usage-controlled digital content. So TUC isn't limited to the specific application environment. Moreover, TUC is a negotiable solution because of the key and policy negotiation in our design. In this way, both the user's and the owner's requirements are taken into consideration. The design and implementation of TUC is then detailed in this paper. Test results show that the performance of TUC is acceptable for access control in distributed environment.","Distributed access control; Trusted computing; Trusted platform module(TPM); Trusted usage control; UCON model","Design; Access rights; Application environment; Control solutions; Data distribution; Digital contents; Digital datas; Distributed access controls; Distributed environments; Distributed networks; Information security requirements; Security requirements; Trusted computing; Trusted computing technology; Trusted platform module; Usage control; Usage policies; Access control"

Security patterns describe good security practices which can be incorporated to the software process and satisfy the requirements that are described by the standards and models. This work proposes a methodology for the tailoring of software processes based on security requirements that are defined by the security practices of the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM). The tailoring has as basis a process framework that is elaborated from the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and security patterns proposed on the literature.","Information security; Processes tailoring; Security patterns; Software processes","Knowledge engineering; Security systems; Software design; Standards; Capability maturity models; Development process; ISO/IEC; Process framework; Processes tailoring; Rational unified process; Secure software development; Security model; Security patterns; Security Practice; Security requirements; Software process; Software processes; Software project; SSE-CMM; Systems security; Security of data"

It is crucial that time-sensitive communications is seamless across all these traditionally stove-piped mission and system domains, in order to meet the demands of current and future warfighters. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has become the preferred approach to span these stove-pipes, enable seamless communications through MILSATCOM enterprise situational awareness and fulfill the net-centric, interoperability strategic vision. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (3010.02, 6212.01E), DoD Information Enterprise Architecture (IEA) (v1.2) and DISA SATCOM-GIG Integration Roadmap recommends Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) as a foundation for achieving program interoperability. Many organizations have difficulty defining net-ready, net-centric and interoperable needs in terms of their mission and how SOA meets their requirements. Our SOA approach for MILSATCOM focuses on delivering communications system status information in a standardized format to improve situational awareness for the MILSATCOM enterprise, which ultimately supports faster responses to enterprise outages and enables more efficient employment of limited MILSATCOM resources. This paper leverages lesson learned from previous SOA implementations capturing a systematic engineering approach to identify net-centric, interoperability needs in mission systems. We use proven open standards and common platforms for shared information processing and distribution. We provide examples of future characteristics of a SOA operating in a net-centric environment to make available the MILSATCOM enterprise status, potential remote operations and configurations to improve system availability and seamless communications. Furthermore, it highlights network management tools and techniques, and information assurance to secure the enterprise information. © 2011 IEEE.","","Data processing; Industry; Information services; Military communications; Network management; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Common platform; Communications systems; Department of Defense; Enterprise Architecture; Enterprise management; Global information grid; Information assurance; MILSATCOM; Mission systems; Net-centric; Net-centric environments; Net-centric operations; Network management tools; Open Standards; Program interoperability; Remote operation; Roadmap; Seamless communication; Shared information; Situational awareness; Strategic vision; System availability; System domain; Systematic engineering; Unified Communications; Warfighters; Interoperability"

The irreversible financial and security damages that can result from this type of threat have placed Insider Threat among the most important problems in cybersecurity [1].

In this approach, multiple detection engines monitor network activities from different perspectives and use the aggregate information to adjust their detection sensitivities.

It is important for security managers to analysis log-files for finding out cause of leakages promptly. Existing methods of presenting log-files take the method of ordering them in time. It makes easy to understand a flow of operations. However, if a log recording an incorrect operation is included in the back of log-file, finding out it may drop back. To address this problem, this paper presents visualization system for log analysis with probabilities of incorrect operation. Incorrect operations are operations that may cause a security incident. Probabilities of incorrect operation are set up by rate of number of incorrect operations in past log-files. Security analysts set order of priority, and logs are sorted. Also, we introduce Visualize Part to help security analysts understand a flow of operations in spite of not ordering logs in time. We aim to contribute speedy security analyses by combine visualizing log-file with probabilities of incorrect operation.

In this paper, we use the Trust/Investor game of the Game Theory to analyze the infection path. In general, the infection path is one game in a complex multi layer game. As a result, based on a Nash equilibrium, a cooperative solution is proposed to arm the existing IT security concepts against such infections. © 2011 IEEE.","Behavioral risks; Event risks; Hybrid risks; Trust/investor game","Computer viruses; Critical infrastructures; Information management; Information technology; Security of data; Viruses; Industrial systems; Information security management systems; IT infrastructures; IT security; Nash Equilibrium; Risk-based; Trust/investor game; Game theory"

Due to the various benefits, future IMD generations will certainly increase this number even more, making wireless connectivity for IMDs a matter of course. Since the data originating from biomedical applications usually contain sensitive information, security and privacy are major issues in IMD communications. The key challenge in providing adequate security for IMDs results from the severe size, power, and memory constraints that are inherent to most of the devices. In this paper, we discuss security and privacy design goals specific to resource-constrained IMDs. We then present a block cipher based security protocol featuring two modes: a stream mode aiming at minimizing the radio duty cycle while maintaining basic security and a session mode providing strong security for highly sensitive information and a role-based user authorization scheme. The protocol is presented using the Artificial Accommodation System (AAS) as an example.

Such normative conflicts between security policies and social norms are therefore undesirable from a security perspective. It has been argued that system developers have a ""meta-task responsibility"", meaning that they have a moral obligation to enable the users of the system they design to cope adequately with their responsibilities. Depending on the situation, this could mean forcing the user to make an ""ethical"" choice, by ""designing out"" conflicts. In this paper, we ask the question to what extent it is possible to detect such potential normative conflicts in the design phase of security-sensitive systems, using qualitative research in combination with so-called system models. We then envision how security design might proactively reduce conflict by (a) designing out conflict where possible in the development of policies and systems, and (b) responding to residual and emergent conflict through organisational processes. The approach proposed in this paper is a so-called subcultural approach, where security policies are designed to be culturally sympathetic. Where normative conflicts either cannot be avoided or emerge later, the organisational processes are used to engage with subcultures to encourage communally-mediated control. © 2011 ACM.","information security; meta-task responsibility; normative conflicts; policy alignment; security policies; subcultures; system models","Design; Security systems; meta-task responsibility; Normative conflict; Security policy; subcultures; System models; Security of data"

In this talk, we report two innovative approaches to defend against large-scale and coordinated attacks in the ubiquitous environments: 1) Inferring the cyber crime's intent through network traffic classification to enable the early warning of potential attacks, and 2) Profiling the large-scale and coordinated cyber attacks through both microscopic and macroscopic modeling to provide better control of such attacks.

In this paper, we propose security-related definitions for these terms. Using this terminology, we argue that research in these areas must consider the functionality of the system holistically, beginning with a careful examination of what we actually want the system to do. We note that much of the published research focuses on a single aspect of a system - availability - as opposed to the system's ability to complete its function without disclosing confidential information or, to a lesser extent, with the correct output. Finally, we discuss ways in which researchers can explore resilience with respect to integrity, availability and confidentiality. © 2011 ACM.","reliability; robustness; security metrics","Reliability; Robustness (control systems); Terminology; Applied science; Confidential information; Information assurance; Research and application; Security metrics; Research"

Furthermore, these system architectures are brittle and fail or are compromised when subjected to ever-increasingly advanced and adaptive cyber attacks, resulting in failed, disrupted or compromised mission operations. While we must continue to raise the bar to protect mission critical systems from these threats by implementing best security practices, the current philosophy of trying to keep the adversaries out, or the assumption that they will be detected if they get through the first line of defense, is no longer valid. Given the sophistication, adaptiveness, and persistence of cyber threats, we can no longer assume that we can completely defend against intruders and must change our mindset to assume some degree of adversary success and be prepared to fight through cyber attacks to ensure mission success even in a degraded or contested environment. This paper will focus on actionable architectural and operational recommendations to address the advanced cyber threat and to enable mission assurance for critical operations. These recommendations can create transformational improvements by helping to reverse adversary advantage, minimize exploit impact to essential operations, increase adversary cost and uncertainty, and act as a deterrent. These approaches go well beyond traditional information assurance, disaster recovery and survivability techniques. The approaches and strategies to be discussed include creative applications of trust technologies and advanced detection capabilities in conjunction with combination of techniques using diversity, redundancy, isolation and containment, least privilege, moving target defense, randomization and unpredictability, deception, and adaptive management and response. © 2011 IEEE.","","Computer crime; Critical infrastructures; Security systems; Supply chains; Technology; Adaptive Management; Adaptiveness; Advanced detections; Commercial information systems; Critical operations; Cyber threats; Cyber-attacks; Disaster recovery; Information assurance; Least privilege; Mission critical systems; Mission operations; Mission success; Moving targets; National security; Security Practice; System architectures; Security of data"

Computer literacy is defined as basic computer skills, whereas computer competency is defined as the computer skills necessary to accomplish job tasks. Inadequate attention has been paid to computer literacy and computer competency scale validity. Purpose: This study developed a computer literacy scale with good reliability and validity and investigated the current computer literacy of newly enrolled students to develop computer courses appropriate to students' skill levels and needs. Methods: This study referenced Hinkin's process to develop a computer literacy scale. Participants were newly enrolled firstyear undergraduate students, with nursing or nursing-related backgrounds, currently attending a course entitled Information Literacy and Internet Applications. Researchers examined reliability and validity using confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The final version of the developed computer literacy scale included six constructs (software, hardware, multimedia, networks, information ethics, and information security) and 22 measurement items. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the scale possessed good content validity, reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. This study also found that participants earned the highest scores for the network domain and the lowest score for the hardware domain. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: With increasing use of information technology applications, courses related to hardware topic should be increased to improve nurse problemsolving abilities. This study recommends that emphases onword processing and network-related topics may be reduced in favor of an increased emphasis on database, statistical softwares, hospital information systems, and information ethics.

This approach is based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Eigen face approach is used for both age prediction and face recognition. The age prediction is carried out by projecting a new face image into this face space and then comparing its position in the face space with those of known faces. It will be reduced the time complexity using this approach. The proposed method preserves the identity of the subject while enforcing a realistic recognition effects on adult facial images between 15 to 60 years old and divided into 11 classes with 5 years old range.

However, by allowing outsourcing computation on the Cloud, users risk of disclosing privacy and obtaining forged results. These potential threats block sensitive applications to join the Cloud. In this paper, we characterize sensitive applications on the Cloud (SAND) problem and define two critical security requirements: confidentiality and verifiability. The former refers to the protection of sensitive programs/data from disclosing to other users or even the Cloud administrators. The latter concerns with user's capability to verify whether computing results are faithfully calculated. To address SAND, we propose a new Cloud model, Trusted Block as a Service (TBaaS), to provide a confidential and verifiable environment for each sensitive application. TBaaS limits Cloud provider's access of sensitive applications while granting user the ability to verify whether the computation is faithfully carried out. Moreover, it offers high flexibility and low performance overhead. © 2011 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Cryptography; Hypervisor; Information Security; Trusted Computing","Computer privacy; Cryptography; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Information technology; Security of data; Cloud models; Cloud providers; High flexibility; Hypervisor; Potential threats; Security requirements; Sensitive application; Trusted computing; Verifiability; Cloud computing"

The improved security techniques are used to preserve the intellectual property. There are many kinds of security mechanisms. New steganographic methods are proposed to embed secret information into a text cover media to search for new possibilities for employing new languages other than English. Here in this paper the authors propose two new methods using Linguistic steganography. By taking the help of Telugu consonant character modifiers and its punctuation marks authors have developed security mechanisms. These markers can be efficiently used as information carriers to hide information into a cover text. In this paper the authors propose a few text based steganographic methods. The proposed methods work by using the linguistic properties of Telugu language. The first method selects embed position of the secret information in the cover text by using Telugu Ottulu. Based on the two level classification of Ottulu, they are assigned a bit 0 or a bit 1. These symbols embed the secret information in the third character of Telugu cover Text data. It maps a single bit of the data with a Telugu character in the specified manner. The second method uses the Telugu linguistic punctuation marks classification. These punctuation marks are classified using a four level classification. Using a four level classification, these punctuation marks are encoded with a 00, 01, 10 and 11 respectively. Secret information is embedded in a Telugu Text. Whenever the application sees a certain punctuation mark it codes this one as secret information. At the receiving side, corresponding opposite methods are applied to get back the original secret message. To improve it further, the information has been encrypted using various cryptographic methods and then this cipher text can also be embedded in the cover text. © 2011 IEEE.","Information Security; Telugu Ottulu; Telugu Punctuation marks; Telugu Text; Text Steganography; Text watermarking","Cryptography; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Security of data; Steganography; Wireless telecommunication systems; Punctuation marks; Telugu Ottulu; Telugu Text; Text steganography; Text watermarking; Classification (of information)"

The information security concept becomes a more complicated subject when the more sophisticated system requirements and real time computation speed are considered. In order to solve these issues, lots of research and development activities are carried out and cryptography has been a very important part of any communication system in the recent years. Cryptographic algorithms fulfil specific information security requirements such as data integrity, confidentiality and authenticity. This work proposes an FPGA-based VLSI Crypto-System, integrating hardware that accelerates the cryptographic algorithms used in the SSL/TLS protocol. SSL v3 and TLS v1 protocol is deployed in the proposed system powered with a Nios-2 soft-core processor. The cipher functions used in SSL-driven connection are the Scalable Encryption Algorithm (SEA), Message Digest Algorithm (MD5), Secured Hash Algorithm (SHA2). These algorithms are accelerated in the VLSI Crypto-System that is on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA DE2 development board. The experimental results shows that, by hardware acceleration of SEA, MD5 and SHA2 cryptographic algorithms, the VLSI Crypto-System performance has increased in terms of speed, optimized area and enhanced level security for the target Cybernetic application. © 2011 IEEE.","Cryptographic algorithm; CtoH Compiler; Hardware accelerator; SSL/TLS protocol; VLSI Crypto-System","Communication systems; Hash functions; Storms; Cryptographic algorithms; CtoH Compiler; Hardware accelerator; SSL/TLS protocol; VLSI Crypto-System; Security of data"

But open and interconnected automation platforms bring about major security challenges. The power grid automation network has inherent security risks due to the fact that the systems and applications for the power grid were originally designed without much consideration of cybersecurity. This paper first introduces scope and functionalities of power grid, its automation and control system, and communications. Potential cyberattacks and their adverse impacts on power grid operation are discussed, a general SCADA cyberattack process is presented. This paper discusses the major challenges and strategies to protect smart grid against cyberattacks and finally proposes a conceptual layered framework for protecting power grid automation systems against cyberattacks without compromising timely availability of control and signal data. The proposed bump-in-the-wire approach also provides security protection for legacy systems which do not have enough computational power or memory space to perform security functionalities.

Even when an IT product is designed securely, various security vulnerabilities can occur, such as buffer overflow, if the general coding technique is used at the development stage. Therefore, the introduction of secure coding rules becomes most critical in developing a robust information security product.

The massive northeastern power blackout of August 2003 and the most recent Florida blackout have both revealed serious defects in both system-level management and device-level designs of the power grid in handling attacks. At the system level, the control area operators lack the capability to 1) obtain real-time status information of the vastly distributed equipment; 2) respond rapidly enough once events start to unravel; and 3) perform coordinated actions autonomously across the region. At the device level, the traditional hardware lacks the capability to 1) provide reliable frequency and voltage control according to system demands and 2) rapidly reconfigure the system to a secure state through switches and power-electronics based devices. These blackouts were a wake-up call for both the industry and academia to consider new techniques and system architecture design that can help assure the security and reliability of the power grid. In this paper, we present a hardware-in-the-loop reconfigurable system design with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination schemes at both local and system levels that would tackle the vulnerabilities of the grid. The new system design consists of five key components: 1) a location-centric hybrid system architecture that facilitates not only distributed processing but also coordination among geographically close devices; 2) the insertion of intelligence into power electronic devices at the lower level of the power grid to enable a more direct reconfiguration of the physical makeup of the grid; 3) the development of a robust collaboration algorithm among neighboring devices to handle possible faulty, missing, or incomplete information; 4) the design of distributed algorithms to better understand the local state of the power grid; and 5) the adoption of a control-theoretic real-time adaptation strategy to guarantee the availability of large distributed systems. Preliminary evaluation results showing the advantages of each component are provided. A phased implementation plan is also suggested at the end of the discussion. © 2011 IEEE.","Adaptive algorithm; fault tolerance; hybrid systems; information security; power system security; reconfigurable architectures; robustness","Adaptive algorithms; Availability; Computer hardware; Critical infrastructures; Electric power distribution; Electron devices; Equipment; Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant computer systems; Hybrid systems; Network security; Reconfigurable hardware; Robustness (control systems); Security of data; Structural design; Systems analysis; Collaboration algorithms; Control area; Coordination scheme; Daily lives; Distributed processing; Distributed systems; Embedded intelligence; Energy infrastructures; Evaluation results; Florida; Hard-ware-in-the-loop; Incomplete information; Key component; Local state; National economy; Power blackout; Power electronic devices; Power grids; Power system security; Re-configurable; Real-time adaptation; Real-time system designs; Reconfigurable architecture; Reconfigurable systems; Reliable operation; System architecture design; System architectures; System levels; Real time systems"

The authors proposed an alternative solution which helps in avoiding a bottleneck in the existing system in terms of performance and availability as the entire client's service transactions are routed through the middleware to the actual Location Based Service Providers (LSP). In the proposed solution, the client and the LSPs can directly communicate with the same level of location security, privacy and anonymity. The trusted middleware is used as certifying authority that generates authentication certificates which contains the Proxy Identity (also called Pseudonyms), and the services subscribed with validity period. The encrypted certificate fulfills the authentication requirements at the LSP servers. In this paper we are reporting the implementation of the proposed system as a proof of concept using Struts Technology of Java. While evaluating the system features such as response time, delay, drop rate etc., the Google Map's location services and the internet browser have been considered as a service provider and client respectively.

It is shown that the evolutionary cryptosystem possesses higher resistance than its initial fixed cryptosystem does for resisting against multidimensional linear cryptanalysis. Multidimensional generalizations of Matsui's Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 based on log-likelihood ratio (LLR) statistics are introduced. By the relationship among the data complexity N, the bit advantage a and the success rate PS of these two multidimensional generalized algorithms, it is proven that more data is needed for attacking the evolutionary cryptosystem than that is needed for attacking its initial fixed cryptosystem when the bit advantage and success rate are identical.

In this work, we proposed a Botnet C&C behavior tracing system (naming C&C Tracer) for capturing the Botnet C&C behavior. The C&C Tracer consists of three components, such as: C&C active behavior feature extracting (CAFE), domain name status querying (DNSQ) and C&C status tracing analyzer (CSTA). In CAFE, different sources of Botnet URLs with diverse representing formats could be parsed for behavior feature generation. According to the parsed URLs, DNSQ can automatic query the C&C domains to the online domain name resolution repository and extract the domain name resolution result. Finally, CSTA considers different observed C&C live and active ability and schedules the tracing strategies. The proposed system not only can incorporate different public blacklist of Botnet C&C, but also dynamically tracing the Botnet C&C behavior for expanding the blacklist in time. This system is fully implemented and operating in real network environment since 2009. The C&C Tracer can reduce the non-active C&C domain name close to 80% with only 0.69% false postive rate. We demonstrate the real cases that identify the Botnet C&C servers by C&C tracer for showing the effectiveness of proposed system. © 2011 IEEE.","behavior tracing; Botnet; command and control; domain name; network security","Command and control systems; Cybernetics; Network security; Active behavior; Behavior tracing; Botnet; C-domain; Command and control; Domain names; Feature extracting; Feature generation; Online domains; Real networks; Real time; Three component; Behavioral research"

To overcome these problems, a new network intrusion detection approach based on improved genetic algorithm (GA) and BPNN classifiers is proposed in this paper. The improved GA used energy entropy to select individuals to optimize the training procedure of the BPNN, and satisfactory BPNN model with proper structure parameters.

As a result of complexity and diversity in real-world activity, fuzzy logic is required for risk assessment. Therefore, developing an integrated framework for seamless security is necessary.

Physical parts consist of a sensor network involving temperature, light, humidity, and intrusion sensors. However, sensing data require computation for analyzing. This study devises a set of cloud services that collect data and control alarms, sprays, and other physical actuators.

However, as far as we know, only a few papers on secure routing protocols have addressed both issues of anonymity and efficiency. Most recent protocols adopted public key Infrastructure (PKI) solutions to ensure the anonymity and security of route constructing mechanisms. Since PKI solution requires huge and expensive infrastructure with complex computations and the resource constraints of small ad hoc devices; a two-layer authentication protocol with anonymous routing (TAPAR) is proposed in this paper. TAPAR does not adopt public key computations to provide secure and anonymous communications between source and destination nodes over wireless ad hoc networks. Moreover, TAPAR accomplishes mutual authentication, session key agreement, and forward secrecy among communicating nodes; along with integration of non-PKI techniques into the routing protocol allowing the source node to anonymously interact with the destination node through a number of intermediate nodes. Without adopting PKI en/decryptions, our proposed TAPAR can be efficiently implemented on small ad hoc devices while at least reducing the computational overhead of participating nodes in TAPAR by 21.75%.

The signals formed by the sensors are transmitted to the base station (BS) using pulse-amplitude modulator adaptively adjusted during the samples transmission. The BS computes estimates of the origin signal, as well as the adjusting controls transmitted to TU through the feedback channel. Transition to the analogue transmission in the channel node-BS simplifies the construction of TU and enables development of analytical methods permitting to design optimal TU capable to transmit the signals to BS with minimal MSE and bit-rate equal to the capacity of the channel. The signals emitted by optimal TU have the form of realizations of white Gaussian noise that increases information security of data-transmission. The results of research enable transition to the practical design of low energy and low cost optimal TU which ensure ideal power-bandwidth trade off, i.e. work at the Shannon boundary. © 2011 IEEE.","adaptive analogue transmission; information limits; optimisation; power-bandwidth efficiency; wireless sensor nets","Bandwidth; Design; Feedback; Gaussian noise (electronic); Optimization; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Analytical design; Analytical method; Bit rates; Feedback channel; information limits; Low costs; Low energies; Optimisations; Trade off; White Gaussian Noise; Wireless sensor; wireless sensor nets; Security of data"

The objective of this study is to find effective ways to adjust peoples perception of information security, in order to enhance their intention to adopt IT appliances and compliance to security practices. Two separate experiments were conducted. In experiment I, 64 participants were asked to transfer money through an e-banking system. Their intention to adopt e-banking was measured by a questionnaire. In experiment II, 64 participants were asked to register on an online forum. Their subjective intention to create a strong password was measured by a questionnaire, and the objective strength of the passwords they created was calculated. Results of the ANOVA and the path models derived from the path analysis indicated that peoples adoption intention, such as their intention to adopt e-banking, can be enhanced by changing their perceived Knowledge, Controllability and Awareness, while changing the perceived Controllability is most effective. The results also indicated that peoples compliance to security practices, such as setting strong passwords for IT systems, can be enhanced by changing their perceived Knowledge, Severity and Possibility, while changing their perceived Knowledge and Severity is most effective.

A mathematical model of a risk based enhanced security for business processes is proposed with suitable metrics while integrating the structured and/or unstructured information for business continuity. The structured and unstructured information assets in various electronic documents within the business processes may change periodically with respect to their type, value and context. In the earlier information security incidents, the dynamic activation of appropriate safeguards, prevention and recovery from risks due to unstructured information were not considered.

We propose a different theoretical model: the value-based compliance model, assuming that multiple forms of rationality are employed in organizational actions at one time, causing potential value conflicts. This has strong strategic implications for the management of information security.

The analysis shows that the nature of information assets possessed by the two firms, either complementary or substitutable, plays a crucial role in influencing these decisions. In the complementary case, we show that the firms have a natural incentive to share security knowledge and no external influence to induce sharing is needed. However, the investment levels chosen in equilibrium are lower than optimal, an aberration that can be corrected using coordination mechanisms that reward the firms for increasing their investment levels. In the substitutable case, the firms fall into a Prisoners' Dilemma trap where they do not share security knowledge in equilibrium, despite the fact that it is beneficial for both of them to do so. Here, the beneficial role of a social planner to encourage the firms to share is indicated. However, even when the firms share in accordance to the recommendations of a social planner, the level of investment chosen by the firms is sub-optimal. The firms either enter into an ""arms race"" where they over-invest or reenact the under-investment behavior found in the complementary case. Once again, this sub-optimal behavior can be corrected using incentive mechanisms that penalize for over-investment and reward for increasing the investment level in regions of under-investment. The proposed coordination schemes, with some modifications, achieve the socially optimal outcome even when the firms are risk-averse.

Therefore, it needs less computation than the existing methods do while maintaining high secure quality. To our knowledge, this is the first secure protocol of this kind.

The objectives under each aspect ranked in order from security function, system, organization, operation, market, legislation, human resource, to mechanism.

A Honey net captures substantial amount of data and logs for analysis in order to identify malicious activities perpetrated by the hacker community. The analysis of this large amount of data is a challenging task. Through this paper, we propose a technique based on the entropy and volume thresholds of selected network features to efficiently analyze Honey net data, and identify malicious activities. Our technique consists of both feature-based and volume-based schemes to identify malicious activities in the Honey net traffic. Through deployment of our proposed approach, a detailed analysis of various traffic features is conducted and the most appropriate features for Honey net traffic are thereupon selected. The anomalies are identified using entropy distributions and volume distributions, along with their corresponding threshold levels. The proposed scheme proves to be effective in identifying most types of anomalies seen in Honey net traffic. © 2011 IEEE.","Anomaly Detection; Cybersecurity; Entropy; Honeynet","Entropy; Personal computing; Analysis of various; Anomaly detection; Cyber security; Entropy distribution; Feature-based; Honeynet; Malicious activities; Network activities; Threshold levels; Traffic features; Volume distributions; Food products"

First, the findings indicated that static information security policies only can take effects when the policies are conveyed to employees clearly and the punishment is carried out well. Second, security awareness practice is one of the most important measures for internal officials. Third, when employees realize the organization is monitoring their information system behaviors and know consequence of information misuse or abuse behavior, the countermeasures can play more effects.

Fingerprint recognition is one of the popular and effective approaches for priori authorizing the users and protecting the information elements during the communications. However, traditional fingerprint recognition approaches have demerits of easy losing rich information and poor performances due to the complex inputs, such as image rotation, incomplete input image, poor quality image enrollment, and so on. In order to overcome these shortcomings, in this paper, a new fingerprint recognition scheme based on a set of assembled invariant moment (geometric moment and Zernike moment) features to ensure the secure communications is proposed. And the proposed scheme is also based on an effective preprocessing, the extraction of local and global features and a powerful classification tool, thus it is able to handle the various input conditions encountered in the cloud computing communication.

It seeks to answer the following research question: what are the attributes of information relevant to value and how can they be used to produce a valuation of the information? Design/methodology/approach: Usinga test bed, hosted onthe college's intranet for 12 days, three important variables were calculated: accessibility, lifespan and outcome across five files. Calculating these three variables is essential to conducting an accurate valuation of the information asset. Findings: The research demonstrates the relationships between these variable (accessibility, lifespan and outcome) as well as showing that they have a critical impact on the value of the information asset. The findings provide a strong rationale for the practitioner or researcher to adopt the model in real time situations. The correlation coefficients of our attributes are: 0.9996 for accessibility and lifespan; 0.9755 for accessibility and outcome and 0.9754 for lifespan and outcome. Research limitations/implications: Due to the sensitive nature of some of the information held by the organization, the observations were somewhat limited. However, the model could be replicated with a collaborative arrangement between the organization and academia. Practical implications: This paper aims to provide a new model for risk management that can be used effectively to conduct a valuation of information assets. The approach will help the organization to better quantify their information assets and will prove to be a useful tool for the next generation of Information security managers. Originality/value: This paper determines the valuation of information assets based on three variables; accessibility, lifespan and outcome. These variables have been identified from the extensive literature review in the area of intangible assets. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Accessibility; Accuracy/reliability; Information; Information assets; Lifespan; Outcome; Risk management; Valuation","Equipment testing; Resource valuation; Risk management; Security of data; Accessibility; Accuracy/reliability; Information; Information assets; Life span; Outcome; Research"

An anomaly inference algorithm is proposed for early detection of cyber-intrusions at the substations. The potential scenario of simultaneous intrusions launched over multiple substations is considered. The proposed detection method considers temporal anomalies. Potential intrusion events are ranked based on the credibility impact on the power system. Snapshots of anomaly entities at substations are described. Simulation results using the modified IEEE 118-bus system have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method for systematic identification.

The general methods to meet these challenges are fairly complicated and difficult to accomplish.

Inspired by the immune principle, the paper designs an Immune-based Distributed Forensics System for e-Commerce (IDFSEC). The system consists of distributed and independent nodes which monitor hierarchical objects from network to service in the e-Commerce site. The paper presents the forensics mechanism of node and the building mechanism of an evidence link. Lastly, experiment is performed to validate the effectivity of IDFSEC. © 2011 IEEE.","adaptive; e-Commerce; forensics; information security; natural immune system","Electronic commerce; Government data processing; Security of data; adaptive; E-commerce sites; forensics; Immune principle; Natural immune systems; Information management"

Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless mesh network technologies with the 802.15.4, 802.11, and WiMAX standards. Each of these will expose the power grid to cybersecurity threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a distributed intrusion detection system for smart grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the analyzing module (AM), in multiple layers of the smart grid. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart gridthe home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs)where they will use the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial immune system (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyberattacks. AMs at each level are trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection. Simulation results demonstrate that this is a promising methodology for supporting the optimal communication routing and improving system security through the identification of malicious network traffic. © 2011 IEEE.","Artificial immune system; cybersecurity; data classification; intrusion detection; smart grid; support vector machine; wireless mesh networks","Computer crime; Computer simulation; Electric power distribution; Immunology; Intrusion detection; MESH networking; Network architecture; Network layers; Optimization; Support vector machines; Wide area networks; Wimax; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Artificial Immune System; cybersecurity; Data classification; Smart grid; Support vector; Wireless mesh; Smart power grids"
